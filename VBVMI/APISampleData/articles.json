                 "body": "<p>~~The month of April 2017 has virtually disappeared for me and will remain a blank page in my calendar for all time. I began the month with a physical ailment that progressed to the point of needing a minor surgical procedure to address it. While I am attempting to keep it all in perspective, I can assure you that physically, it has been the most painful experience of my life, and has revealed a serious flaw in my spiritual life. Perhaps &ndash; I&rsquo;m believing it &ndash; that was the point of the pain.</p>\n\n<p>I am a very practical person. I do not believe in randomness, or coincidence. I believe that God is sovereignly in control of all things. All things. All the time. And so, I have the habit of looking for the lesson in anything He allows me to experience. This time, I could not find it. Knowing that physical pain is just a consequence of living in a fallen creation makes it hard to redeem it for any spiritual purpose, I thought. Having not been tested in this way before, I could not make sense of it. I felt as if Jesus was standing in a corner of the room with His arms crossed watching me struggle, and doing nothing to help. It felt like the most personal kind of betrayal. I had done nothing to bring this on myself. I had nothing in this from which to confess and repent. It was just&hellip; random, pointless suffering. And to be perfectly honest, the pain was blinding to the point that I could not reason, could not think, could not run to the Word for guidance. I was literally at the end of my ability to cope. All I could do was beg Him to help me. But He didn&rsquo;t. Not in the way I wanted Him to, and that was my error.</p>\n\n<p>When I could see through the post-surgical Vicodin haze, my questions then became something along the lines of who I believe Him to be. What do I really believe about my Savior? What have I failed to believe? What did I need Him to be that He wasn&rsquo;t? Is it enough that he is &ldquo;there&rdquo; in the valley of the shadow if He does nothing? Did He really betray me&hellip; or did my own lack of understanding? Who is this God, anyway, and what has He <em><strong>really</strong></em> promised me&hellip;and is that really, truly, enough when it is all I have but I don&rsquo;t think I can survive another minute without more?</p>\n\n<p>The Body has been faithful to listen to my heart and guide me to some hard answers. You know those hard answers? One sister in Christ gently asked me if I am faithful to remember every way God had blessed me leading up to that moment, and pointed out that it was unfair of me to call Him unfaithful when it was I who had forgotten &ldquo;all His benefits&rdquo; in my usually comfortable life. She also pointed out all the ways He had been faithful<em><strong> through </strong></em>the process, even though immediate healing was not in His plan. Another sister asked me if I had <em><strong>let</strong></em> Him help me, citing my typically capable, independent, self-reliant character (she was kind enough not to call it sin). They collectively challenged my perception of God&rsquo;s love, what I believe to be &ldquo;good&rdquo;, what I believe to be a parent&rsquo;s responsibility to their child, and what I have believed God has promised to His children. It has been a little overwhelming.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the small moment of clarity I&rsquo;ve gleaned in hindsight. Let me start by telling you that the surgical experience has been one of the best health-care experiences I have ever had. These people! I don&rsquo;t even have words. Having never seen me before as a patient for consult or anything else, they worked me in to the front of the surgeon&rsquo;s schedule &ndash; not the back, the front. When he saw my condition, he expressed heartfelt sympathy. He sighed heavily as he explained what he would have to do to begin the process of healing, and then immediately set about the process - with a waiting room full of people who had long-standing appointments. I was there over an hour. He never once made me feel rushed, or like an imposition. When he began his work, the surgeon&rsquo;s nurse held my hand, stroked my arm, and talked to me as a distraction. She noticed that I was not breathing and reminded me to. She was sympathetic and understood my pain and my poor attempt to joke my way through it. The surgeon meanwhile, apologized every single time he had to do something he knew would hurt. Every. Time. And I was so grateful that <em><strong>this</strong></em> pain would be productive that I did not even care. I had suffered the random pain of disease for two weeks with no relief. At least this pain would bring healing.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the moment of clarity I promised. God is the surgeon. Jesus and the Holy Spirt are the nurse. My God was not standing idly by with His arms crossed refusing to help me. <u><em><strong>This was the help</strong></em></u>. This was the pain that would lead to healing my broken understanding of who He is, and who I am, and who we are together. And (in hindsight) I am so grateful to have the disease exposed so healing can come. I do not want to meet Him with anything but a right understanding of His character, and our relationship. I want to <em><strong>know</strong></em> Him. If this is the way, let me walk in it.</p>\n\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t answered all those questions I mentioned (and more), but at least I&rsquo;m asking them. I didn&rsquo;t even know I needed to before now. I&rsquo;m working on it. <em><strong>We</strong></em> are working on it together. In fact, let me belabor the comparison in the hope that in your next moment of pain it will be helpful to you. Through this surgical experience, I&rsquo;ve learned that:</p>\n\n<p>Just as the surgeon made time for me, God always has time for me at the front of His schedule. No waiting required. Psalm 34:15-17, 1 Peter 5:7</p>\n\n<p>Just as the surgeon sympathized, and regretted my pain, but was willing to do the procedure in order to bring me relief, God sympathizes with my disease and longs to cure it, not to delay healing. Psalm 103, Romans 8:28</p>\n\n<p>Just as the nurse stroked my arm and held my hand, Jesus comforts me with the comfort of true understanding, having suffered just as I suffer (and far more so). Hebrews 2:9-18, 2 Corinthians 1:3-5</p>\n\n<p>Just as the nurse reminded me to breathe and used her words when I had no words, the Spirit counsels me and intercedes for me when we cannot even think how to pray. Romans 8:26-27</p>\n\n<p>So maybe the month of April, 2017 will be blank on my earthly calendar but will be full to the brim on my heavenly timeline. Appointments were met, meetings were held, and trips were made all for the purpose of making my roots grow down into God&rsquo;s love to keep me strong, so that I will eventually have the power to understand how wide, how long, how high, how deep is His love for me. Then I will be complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God who is able to do more for me than I could ever ask or imagine. (Ephesians 3:7-17-20)</p>\n\n<p>Let me leave you with one closing thought for that moment when you can find nothing else.</p>\n\n<p><em>\"&hellip;we are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus&#39; sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</em> <em><strong>Therefore, we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.\" </strong></em>&nbsp;2 Corinthians 4:8-11,16-18 (emphasis mine)</p>"

(Exodus 34:5-8)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After G-d gave the commandments to the Israelites verbally and they agreed to do all He commanded (Exodus 24:3), Moses went up on the mountain to be with G-d (Exodus 24:15).&nbsp; While he was away, the Israelites fell into the sin of the golden calf (Exodus chapter 32).&nbsp; Moses then returns, sees their sin, and breaks the stone tablets of the covenant in his anger (Exodus 32:19).</p>\n\n<p>G-d reveals His compassion and mercy in the fact that He did not immediately obliterate all those who sinned in the matter of the calf.&nbsp; In fact, He calls Moses back up on the mountain to create a new set of tablets.&nbsp; It is in this context we find what are known as the thirteen <em>midot</em>: the Thirteen Attributes of G-d, also known as the&nbsp;Thirteen Attributes of Mercy. The Talmud describes these in detail in <em>Tosephot Rosh HaShanah </em>17b.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s take a brief look at G-d&#39;s attributes that He reveals in this moment.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>YHVH </em></strong>(Strong&#39;s #3068) - the special four letter name of G-d given to Moses at the burning bush.<br />\nThis name reveals G-d&#39;s covenant-keeping nature.<br />\n(The Talmud notes that G-d is merciful <strong>before </strong>a person sins.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>YHVH </em></strong>- stated a second time as an intensive.<br />\n(The Talmud notes that G-d is also merciful <strong>after </strong>a person sins.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>El </em></strong>(Strong&#39;s #410) - Hebrew for \"mighty\". <em>El</em> is also short for <em>Elohim</em> which is the Hebrew word for G-d.<br />\nThis word reveals G-d as Deity.<br />\n(The Talmud notes that G-d is all powerful.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Rachum </em></strong>(Strong&#39;s #7349) - Hebrew for \"full of compassion\".&nbsp; This Hebrew word is related to the word for \"womb\" and motherlike compassion associated with womanhood.<br />\nThis adjective reveals G-d&#39;s nature as compassionate and merciful.<br />\n(The Talmud states G-d is compassionate.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Channun </em></strong>(Strong&#39;s #2587) - Hebrew for \"gracious\".<br />\nThis word reveals G-d&#39;s character as the G-d of Grace.<br />\n(The Talmud states G-d is gracious.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Erekh aphayyim </em></strong>(Strong&#39;s #750&nbsp;and Strong&#39;s #639) - Hebrew for \"slow to anger\" [literally \"slow nostrils\"- when someone is angry they flare their nostrils].<br />\nThis phrase reveals G-d&#39;s patient nature.<br />\n(The Talmud notes G-d is slow to anger.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Rav chesed </em></strong>(Strong&#39;s #7227&nbsp;and Strong&#39;s #2617) - Hebrew for \"great in kindness\" or \"great in covenantal devotion\".<br />\nThis part reveals G-d&#39;s character as abundantly kind.<br />\n(The Talmud states G-d is abounding in kindness.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Emet </em></strong>(Strong&#39;s #571) - Hebrew for \"trustworthy\" or \"truth\".- This word reveals G-d&#39;s character as \"Truth\". Yeshua said He is the Way the \"Truth\" and the Life (John 14:6).<br />\n(The Talmud states G-d is kind even after His scrutiny of our conduct.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Notzer chesed lo&#39;olafim </em></strong>(Strong&#39;s #5341, Strong&#39;s #2617, and Strong&#39;s #505) - Hebrew for \"keeping covenant devotion for thousands\" [of years? generations?].<br />\nThis phrase reveals G-d&#39;s character as consistently faithful and kind.<br />\n(The Talmud states G-d&#39;s kindness extends to future generations.)</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Nosei avon </strong></em>(Strong&#39;s #5375 and Strong&#39;s #5771) - Hebrew for \"forgiving of iniquity\" [<em>avon </em>being intentional sin: iniquity].<br />\nThis description reveals G-d&#39;s character as forgiving of iniquity.<br />\n(The Talmud states G-d forgives sins committed willfully.)</p>\n\n<p>[<em><strong>Nosei</strong></em>] <em><strong>peshah </strong></em>(Strong&#39;s #6588) - Hebrew for \"[forgiving of] transgression\" [<em>peshah </em>being rebellious sin: transgression].<br />\nThis part reveals G-d&#39;s character as forgiving of rebellious sin.<br />\n(The Talmud states G-d forgives sins committed in defiance of His will.)</p>\n\n<p>[<strong><em>Nosei</em></strong>] <strong><em>chatah </em></strong>(Strong&#39;s #2403) - Hebrew for \"[forgiving of] sin\" [<em>chatah </em>being accidental sin].<br />\nThis word reveals G-d&#39;s character as forgiving of accidental sin.<br />\n(The Talmud states G-d forgives sins committed unwittingly.)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>V&#39;nakeh lo yanakeh </em></strong>(Strong&#39;s #5352, Strong&#39;s #3808, and&nbsp;Strong&#39;s #5352) - Hebrew for \"not leaving unpunished\" [the guilty].&nbsp;<br />\nThis phrase reveals G-d&#39;s character as the righteous judge.</p>\n\n<p>Here the Talmud states G-d acquits the <em>repentant sinner</em>, but that is <strong>not </strong>what what is written here.&nbsp; It says He will not leave the&nbsp;guilty <strong>unpunished</strong>.&nbsp; The Sages were forced to deal with the apparent conflict of this last attribute with the rest of G-d&#39;s character.&nbsp; This thirteenth attribute creates a \"dissonance\" in the pattern of what G-d just revealed. It doesn&#39;t fit with all the gracious, merciful, and compassionate character traits that came before it.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We might understand this by way of a simile...a song in this case:</p>\n\n<p>Some songs have a dissonant chord structure just before the final chord.&nbsp; (Think about some of the old hymns that have an \"ayyyy...men\" at the end.&nbsp; The \"ay\" in that \"ayyyy...men\" is usually a dissonant chord.)&nbsp; In these chords, the middle of three notes in the chord sounds too high. It is only when that center (or 2nd note) \"comes down\" that the dissonance is resolved and the chord sounds finished and complete.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar way, it was only when the \"second note\" of the G-dhead (the Son) came down to dwell among men (John 1:14) that the apparent dissonance is resolved to a complete \"chord of grace\". For those who do not accept the arrival of that second note (the Messiah <em>Yeshua</em>) the dissonance still remains and sets their teeth on edge (Jeremiah 31:29).</p>\n\n<p>This is the \"song\" of G-d&#39;s new covenant: He has provided complete grace, compassion, and mercy to those He has chosen, even in full view of His righteous justice.&nbsp; \"Sing to the Lord a new song, Sing His praise from the end of the earth!\" (Isaiah 42:10).</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat shalom!</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p><a style=\"visibility: hidden;\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~About a year ago, a friend asked me if I wanted to take part in a local charitable effort. It was something that I had always been interested in and seemed like a group doing good work, so of course I jumped at the chance. No sooner than the first email exchange concluded, I knew that I had made a terrible mistake. This group is indeed doing good, and there are many happily committed volunteers working to support it, but it is a hot mess of inefficiency, redundancy, disorganization, illogic, and waste, none of which I have any (and I mean <em><strong>any</strong></em>) tolerance for. I am exasperated beyond expression by the whole experience.</p>\n\n<p>You understand, don&rsquo;t you, that the problem is me? I am a Martha. I am Martha to the bone. I am<em><strong> happy </strong></em>to be Martha in every way, and I don&rsquo;t relate well to the Mary&rsquo;s of the world. I have a Martha response to them. Get up. Do something. And if it&rsquo;s worth doing, it&rsquo;s worth doing right, or at least well. Your lack of planning or effort or organization should not become someone else&rsquo;s burden.</p>\n\n<p>Martha always gets a bad rap, and for some reason &ndash; well for a lot of really valid reasons in a modern cultural application, but that&rsquo;s another post &ndash; we twist around the story of Luke 10 until we have demonized Martha for nothing more than serving in her gift, while lauding Mary for laying around listening to Jesus. And yes, I know He said that Mary chose the better part, but He was talking about the <em><strong>listening</strong></em>, not the laying around (read some of the Proverbs if you&rsquo;d like to argue the point). Jesus never told Martha to stop what she was doing. He never told her that she was somehow broken, that her desire to serve well was wrong, or that she needed to change who she was created by God to be. He just told her to reconsider her focus. That&rsquo;s what I realized is wrong with my service in this organization. What Luke records about Martha is true of me as well. I am distracted by my service and worried and bothered by many things.</p>\n\n<p>If you parse the Greek on those three words &ndash; distracted, worried, and bothered &ndash; you can loosely interpret that to say that Martha is being drawn away (from Jesus) by much ministry, seeking to promote her own interests, and in a tumult like a crowd that&rsquo;s all stirred up.</p>\n\n<p>What people usually fail to see is the change in Martha, evident if you follow her story throughout the gospels to where we find her in John 11 and 12. She took Jesus&rsquo; words to heart and found a way to listen <em><strong>while</strong></em> she worked. It was entirely beyond Martha&rsquo;s ability (or desire, I would guess) to change her very nature and stop serving to lounge about with the guys listening to Jesus, so she learned to serve <em><strong>and </strong></em>listen. She didn&rsquo;t contort her character or shirk her duties (see John 12), but she learned to serve <em><strong>and</strong></em> hear (even in that she is the model of efficient multi-tasking!).</p>\n\n<p>Now maybe Martha and I are the only ones here, but&hellip; I think not.&nbsp;What I came to understand today is that&nbsp;it&rsquo;s OK to be dissatisfied with the current state of affairs (God is a God of order and efficiency!) but it is not OK to become so distracted by my own agenda (chaffing against the system) that I am in such a tumult that I cannot hear Jesus over the sound of the crowd in my head! My focus while serving this group has been all wrong. There is good work being done here! Jesus is totally in it! It is work that He is blessing in spite of its messiness, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s bearing fruit. I just haven&rsquo;t been able to appreciate all of that because every experience has for me&nbsp;been an exercise in maddening annoyance. (I&#39;m sure they feel likewise!)</p>\n\n<p>That said, I am and always will be Martha. Unlike Martha, I have a choice here. I am not compelled to continue serving in this role. Knowing that and applying wisdom tells me that it&rsquo;s time to make room for someone who can serve in this role <em><strong>and</strong></em> hear Jesus while they&rsquo;re doing it. I can&rsquo;t. I would like to say that I could stay and be refined, but I know better. There are other places where I can serve and hear Jesus (and not do harm while I&rsquo;m at it!). I am there already in more than one instance.<br />\nI think it&rsquo;s OK to know our limits, to admit our sin, and not to seek out opportunities that test the very last nerve of our tolerance level (he who would not fall down ought not to walk in slippery places!). This is the way I am wired. God created me this way, and He has good work for me to do utilizing all the gifts He has given me. I don&rsquo;t have to change the way this group operates, or even change myself to fit here. I just need to &ndash; as my son always says &ndash; get in my own lane and serve where I can still hear Jesus as I do. Being Martha. Listening.</p>"

I spend my time working for the school that&rsquo;s on-site but I&rsquo;m in a building separate from the school itself where I am typically alone. As spring approaches, and the weather that comes with it, the school is required to practice emergency weather procedures. In fact, the entire Shelter participates. When the lights and sirens sound, everyone is supposed to go to the closest safe-room and then report in by walkie-talkie to the person who is checking names off a list. Everyone on the premises must be accounted for before the lights and sirens stop.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, when we&rsquo;ve had a fire drill, I have just waited it out until the person checking my building came by to see that I was indeed fine and reported that I was accounted for. Until recently, I&rsquo;ve never been there during a weather alert. When the alert sounded, I calmly continued to work, waiting for someone to come around and check me off the list, never considering the fact that unlike in a fire situation, no one is going to be wandering around checking rooms while a tornado is bearing down on us. I know. Show me some grace. After about 20 minutes of listening to the siren blaring, I&rsquo;m starting to think something has fouled up the works. Little did I guess that it was me. That is until the teacher who had brought her kids in from the playground to the safe-room in my building came knocking on my door rather abruptly, and with less tolerance than normal told me in no uncertain terms that I needed to get into the safe-room. Now. Uttering into her walkie,&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;er.&rdquo; So, you know, color me embarrassed.</p>\n\n<p>This last week was a rather stormy season for me emotionally. Wind. Pelting rain. Thunder. Lightening. Hail. And yes, the possibly of a tornado. The storm roiled and brewed, and finally built up a towering wall cloud with a cold and mighty outflow boundary. It let loose. It caused damage. It took names. And the aftermath was destruction as far as the eye could see. The landscape was leveled. Then, as it is with all such storms, the sun broke - only to illuminate the devastation.</p>\n\n<p>Please tell me you&rsquo;ve had this experience, if only to reassure me that this is common to the human condition and not just common to my particular condition. So many things to say here. There are so many warnings in scripture. So many remedies to dry up an internal storm like the one I was brewing. Rather than heed even one, I decided to stand my own ground and ignore the warnings, and I did not seek shelter from the storm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I was only one of those affected by the damaging onslaught. While I felt relieved as the storm passed and the electricity was drained from the air, I was left with that sick feeling of dread in its wake. What had I done? Everywhere I looked, there were walking wounded&hellip; and that included me. Why? Why do I not heed the lights and sirens? Why must I insist on riding out the storm, fully convinced I have it within me to stand like the mighty oak and face it head on with no protection? Well, I have my own answers to that question and they beg a different post, but you may benefit from asking yourself the same thing if you are similarly inclined to resist seeking shelter. Are you ignoring what&rsquo;s brewing up inside you? Is it starting to gather steam? Are you seeing that cloudbank looming on the horizon? Let me help you out here...TAKE SHELTER IMMEDIATELY. Don&rsquo;t wait for someone to come &lsquo;round checking on you. GET IN THE SAFE ROOM. NOW! Cover your head with a blanket and beg for the mercy of God to make the storm pass over you harmlessly.Then rejoice in the Lord that you live another day: one without regret.</p>\n\n<p><em>For in the day of trouble He will conceal me in His tabernacle;<br />\nIn the secret place of His tent He will hide me;<br />\nHe will lift me up on a rock.<br />\nAnd now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me,<br />\nAnd I will offer in His tent sacrifices with shouts of joy;<br />\nI will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD.

As you know, our enemy, Satan, is a master of deceit and subtlety. That is why he wraps lies in pretty packages. <em>The Shack</em> is a beautiful story. Paul Young is a gifted author. He paints vivid pictures with his words and evokes deep emotional responses from his readers. But, hidden within the masterful storytelling, there are subtle lies that lead people away from the truth. Even a little poison hidden within something can cause death though it is small in comparison to the whole. (1 Cor. 5:6; Gal. 5:9) &ldquo;<em>A little leaven leavens the whole lump</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>We feel very strongly about this danger. &nbsp;Before writing this, we spent hours in prayer asking the Lord to remove this burden from us. He has not but has instead increased the urgency and weight of it. &nbsp;We cannot dismiss the directive the Lord has given us. We must obey even at the risk of offending or angering some people who believe this book to be a great work of Christian literature.</p>\n\n<p>Let me first address the most common defense of <em>The Shack.</em> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only fiction.&rdquo; It is interesting to note that most who defend the book with this phrase then say something like, &ldquo;It changed my life.&rdquo; There is no denying the power behind this story to affect people&rsquo;s lives, and it is this very fact that negates the argument that it is &ldquo;only fiction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Any author who addresses the eternal issues that Mr. Young addresses and calls himself a Christian is responsible to adhere to the Bible as his/her source of truth. And we, as Christ followers, are instructed to test the spirits and the teachings that we encounter. I am not judging Mr. Young as a person or even as a believer. Only God can look into a man&rsquo;s heart. I am, however, judging his teaching and the spirit behind it.</p>\n\n<p>There are dozens of ministries and notable scholars, teachers, pastors, apologists, etc. who agree that this book is unscriptural in its teaching. There are also dozens, maybe hundreds by now, of sermons and papers that have been written to address the unbiblical content of The Shack.</p>\n\n<p>I have attempted to condense the information I have read and listened to, coupled with my own study to arrive at six crucial points which I believe to be fundamental to our faith.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>First Argument</strong></u></p>\n\n<p><em>The Shack</em>&nbsp;maintains that scripture is not always reliable or valid. Without the word of God as our foundation, God&#39;s people would&nbsp;be &ldquo;tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine.&rdquo; If scripture cannot be trusted, then our salvation is not secure. The importance of scripture cannot be minimized.</p>\n\n<p>For example, on page 98 the book questions the words of Jesus on the cross (&ldquo;My God. My God. Why have You forsaken me?&rdquo;). The character \"Papa\" (who represents God the Father) says, &ldquo;Regardless of what He felt at that moment, I never left Him,&rdquo; and &ldquo;He found His way through it to put Himself completely into My hands.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jesus was not mistaken or lost in some emotional state at that moment. Rather He was declaring truth by directing His listeners to the prophecy written by David in Psalm 22, where the crucifixion is described in great detail although it was written hundreds of years before the Romans began using crucifixion as a form of execution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A second example on pages 67-68 finds the character \"Mack\" (father of the murdered girl) declaring, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s voice had been reduced to paper, and even that paper had to be moderated and deciphered by the proper authorities and intellects&hellip;Nobody wanted God in a box just in a book. Especially an expensive one bound in leather with gilt edges, or was that guilt edges?&rdquo; Note his disdainful attitude.</p>\n\n<p>In a&nbsp;third example on page 136, Mack says&nbsp;to the character \"Sarayu\", who represents the Holy Spirit, &ldquo;There are lots of people who think it (i,e,. the Garden of Eden, Creation) was only a myth.&rdquo; Her answer is, &ldquo;Well, their mistake isn&rsquo;t fatal. Rumors of glory are often hidden inside what many consider myths and tales.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Bible is God&rsquo;s revelation of Himself&nbsp;to us, His followers, and as such we should be defending and proclaiming the inerrancy of scripture and elevating its teaching to the place of respect it deserves as the source of absolute truth breathed out by God Himself, not casting doubt on its validity (see 2Tim. 3:16).</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Second Argument</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>Mr. Young misrepresents the very nature of God. He portrays God in a way that is not consistent with His revelation of Himself in His Word and in His Son. I&rsquo;ll give four examples:</p>\n\n<p>On page 84 and elsewhere, God the Father is represented by a female character. God is neither male nor female as humans are, however&nbsp;in the Bible God has chosen to describe Himself as Father and with a male pronoun, never with feminine pronouns. Choosing to portray God the Father as female is clearly an attempt to counter scripture and confuses the true nature of God.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, on page&nbsp;85 Papa&nbsp;says to Mack, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do things on your terms and time.\" God does not do things on our terms or time. There is a myriad of scriptures that tell us God does things according to His purpose, to fulfill His plan and His will, never ours. Ez. 36:22 tells us that God acts, &ldquo;<em>for the sake of His holy name</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, on page 124 it says, speaking of the Trinity, &ldquo;We have no concept of final authority among us&hellip;You end up with some chain of command or a system of order that destroys relationship rather than promotes it&rdquo;. On page 147 &ldquo;God&rdquo; says, &ldquo;We are submitted to you in the same way&rdquo;. Mack asks, &ldquo;Why would the God of the universe want to be submitted to me?&rdquo; The answer is, &ldquo;Because We want you to join Us in Our circle of relationship&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, God is the author of authority, structure and order. All authority comes from Him. (Rom. 13:1) I know of no instance in the Bible where God is submitted to us in any way. And authority even exists within the Trinity. 1Cor. 15:27-28 says, &ldquo;<em>God has put all things in subjection under His feet&hellip;it is plain that He is excepted who put all things in subjection under Him. When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to Him&hellip;that God may be all in all</em>.\"&nbsp; In John 14:10 Jesus says, &ldquo;T<em>he words I say to you I do not speak on My own authority</em>&rdquo;. In 1Cor. 14:40 the word instructs us that, &ldquo;<em>All things should be done decently and in order</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, on page 122 Papa says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to punish people for sin. It&rsquo;s not My purpose to punish it&rdquo;. On page 164 the character of Wisdom says to Mack, &ldquo;I am only asking you to do something you believe God does. You believe He will condemn most&hellip;Is that not true?&rdquo; Her meaning is that the assumption that God will judge is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>But God says in His word in Isaiah&nbsp;13:11, &ldquo;<em>I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity</em>&rdquo;. Rom. 2:8 states, &ldquo;<em>For those who do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury</em>&rdquo;. Jesus warns us in Luke 12:5 to, &ldquo;<em>Fear Him who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell</em>&rdquo;. God is love, but His love is also just and holy. I Peter 1:16 says, &ldquo;<em>Be holy for I am holy</em>&rdquo;. We cannot choose to love and accept only part of God&rsquo;s nature, nor can we define God on our terms. Either He is who He says He is or He is not God at all.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Third Argument</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>In <em>The Shack</em> the deity and significance of Jesus is called into question. If the importance of Jesus is questionable then so is our salvation. On page 88 the character of Jesus speaks of His name as being open for debate. He says, &ldquo;Jesus? Yes. And you can call Me that if you like. After all, it has become My common name&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that the Hebrew word for Jesus was Yeshua and Joshua may be a closer English translation, but this statement gives the impression that the profound significance of the person and the name of Jesus is up for personal interpretation. Phil. 2:9-10 says, &ldquo;<em>God has highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven on earth and under the earth</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>On page 101 Papa says, &ldquo;Although He is also fully God, He has never drawn upon His nature as God to do anything&rdquo;. On page 102 it says, &ldquo;Jesus, as a human being, had no power within Himself to heal anyone&rdquo;. And &ldquo;Although I have only been limited in Jesus, I have never been limited in Myself&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>The implication that Jesus was somehow limited or less God because He became human is certainly not biblical. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;<em>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God&hellip;All things were made through Him and without Him was not anything made that was made</em>&rdquo;. In Matt. 9:5-6 when Jesus healed the paralytic it says it was to show that, &rdquo;<em>The Son has authority to forgive sins</em>&rdquo;, something that only God could do. And Col. 2:9 tells us, &ldquo;<em>For in Him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily</em>&rdquo;. Finally, in Rev. 19:15 it says, &ldquo;<em>He (Jesus) will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God</em>&rdquo;. That does not sound like a limited human to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Fourth Argument</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>The Shack passes a harsh verdict on the church. On page 95 Mr. Young uses the terms &ldquo;religious conditioning&rdquo; and &ldquo;religious stereotypes&rdquo; to define the established church. Page 125 refers to a &ldquo;system of order that destroys relationship&rdquo;, and on page 183 Mack says, &ldquo;But so many of the people I care about seem to be both in it and of it. Mack was thinking of friends, church people. He knew they loved Jesus, but he also knew they were sold out to religious activity and patriotism&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Scripture teaches us that Jesus is the Head of the church, it is His Body. (Eph. 5:23) The system of order that governs the church was set up by God in the first place. (I Cor. I &amp; II Tim. Titus) It is also interesting that the author twists the scripture to say that we should be in the church but not of it, when the Bible says it is we, the church, who are to be in the world but not of it. John 17:14&amp;16 say, &ldquo;<em>They are not of this world even as I am not of this world</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately man, under the influence of our enemy, has taken what God intended and corrupted it. I know too that Jesus was no fan of the religious hypocrisy of His day, nor does He approve of it today. I personally am outspoken against legalism and hypocrisy. &nbsp;However, the attitude behind Mr. Young&rsquo;s statements condemns the church and all it stands for as a whole. It leads readers to the conclusion that being involved with their local church is a bad thing.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches that we should not forsake the gathering together of the brethren. There are hundreds of verses that instruct us to love our brother. In the New Testament the word translated brother means brother or sister, specifically siblings in a family. Our brother is referring to other believers, the Body of Christ, the Church. We are supposed to be known by our love for each other so let us be careful to treat our Lord&rsquo;s Body with respect.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Fifth Argument</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>Mr. Young consistently leads readers to the conclusion that our enemy and his followers do not exist. He never refers to Satan. Mack is the only one to speak of hell and whenever he does he is ridiculed. I&rsquo;ll cite three examples here:</p>\n\n<p>&ndash; On page 138: Papa says, &ldquo;Both evil and darkness can be understood only in relation to light and good, they do not have any actual existence&rdquo;.<br />\n&ndash; On page 192: Papa states, &ldquo;All evil flows from independence and independence is your choice. Evil is the chaos of this age that you brought to Me&rdquo;.<br />\n&ndash; On page 164: Wisdom infers the fallacy of belief in God sentencing anyone to hell.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus, Himself spoke very vividly of the reality of hell. (Luke 12:5, 16:23-24) I John 3:8 says, &ldquo;<em>Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil</em>&rdquo;. In Eph. 6:11 and I Tim. 3:7 we are warned about the schemes and snares of the devil. And in Rev. 20:15 we are told of the destiny of those whose names were not found written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life.</p>\n\n<p>Hell and Satan are very real. He and his followers hate us, the church, and will stop at nothing to destroy us. However, one of his favorite tactics is to lull believers into a place of false security denying that he really exists or that we are in a battle against him. I Peter 5:8 tells us, &ldquo;<em>Our adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour</em>&rdquo;. Ephesians 6:12 warns us that we are in a battle. How can we overcome our enemy if we spend our time in emotional fantasies, sniffing flowers and drifting in canoes completely unaware or denying that we are being shot at?</p>\n\n<p>For unbelievers the denial of hell and judgment is eternally devastating. I&rsquo;d like to quote an excerpt from the famous sermon by Jonathan Edwards titled, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You cannot bear the fierceness and wrath of the infinite God. Tis a great furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as much against you as against many of the damned in hell. Consider this, you who are here present, that yet remain in an unregenerate state. When God beholds the ineffable extremity of your case, and sees your torment to be so vastly disproportionate to your strength, and sees how your poor soul is crushed and sinks down, as it were into an infinite gloom, He will have no compassion on you. He will not forbear the executions of His wrath, or in the least lighten His hand. There shall be no moderation or mercy, nor will God then at all stay His rough wind. Ez. 8:18 &ldquo;Therefore I will act in wrath, My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity, and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>For us to allow the lost to believe there is no danger of hell is unthinkable if we are to love them. This brings us to point Six:</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Sixth Argument</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>Mr. Young embraces a form of Universalism or Universal Reconciliation. He has said as much (albeit in his typically elusive manner) in interviews which can be found on-line. There are several instances in <em>The Shack</em> where this belief surfaces.</p>\n\n<p>Papa states on page 225 &ldquo;In Jesus, I have forgiven all humans for their sins against me, but only some choose relationship.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; On page 93 Papa refers to all people as &ldquo;Her kids&rdquo;. On page 164 the author calls all people God&rsquo;s children and implies that God will not send anyone to eternal torment. On page 192 Papa states that, &ldquo;the chaos of this age will not have the final say even though it touches everyone whom Papa loves, those who follow and those who don&rsquo;t&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>We are not all God&rsquo;s children. We are all His creations to do with as He pleases, but John 1:12 tells us, &ldquo;<em>All who did receive Him, who believed in His name; to them He gave the right to become children of God</em>&rdquo;. The Bible does refer to others. In Eph. 5:6 God refers to the &ldquo;<em>children of disobedience</em>&rdquo; and in Matt. 13:38 Jesus teaches, in the parable of the wheat and tares, &ldquo;<em>that the good seed is the children of the kingdom and the weeds are the sons of the evil one</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>His purpose will be fulfilled, but it is not for everyone to be saved. Romans 9:22-24 says, &ldquo;<em>What if God, desiring to show His wrath and to make known His power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction in order to make known the riches of His glory for vessels of mercy which He has prepared beforehand for glory-even us whom He has called</em>&rdquo;. And Eph. 3:10, &ldquo;<em>So that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places</em>&rdquo;. There is more going on here than we can fathom, but it is not universalism.</p>\n\n<p>On pages 193-194 there is a conversation between Papa and Mack where Mack asks what Jesus accomplished by dying. The answer Papa gives is, &ldquo;Through His death and resurrection I am now fully reconciled to the world&rdquo;. (This is backward incidentally!) Mack replies, &ldquo;The whole world? You mean those who believe in You right?&rdquo; To which Papa replies, &ldquo;The whole world, Mack&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>On page 121 Papa says to Mack, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you to believe anything&rdquo;. And on page 184 Jesus says, &ldquo;Who said anything about being a Christian?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>If not a Christian, then what? The Bible says, &ldquo;<em>Those who do not believe are condemned already</em>&rdquo;. John 3:18 and John 8:23 says, &ldquo;<em>Unless you believe you will die in your sins</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>In the few places where the perfect opportunity to share the Gospel arises there is instead a mass of ambiguous, flowery words that miss the mark entirely.</p>\n\n<p>On page 149 when Mack asks Jesus if there is any way out of this (declaring what is good and evil and trying to determine our own destiny) Jesus answer is, &ldquo;by returning. By turning back to Me. By giving up your ways of power and manipulation and just coming back to Me. (as if we were already saved, we just forgot for a little while)</p>\n\n<p>This next passage may very well be the most critical of heresies in the whole book. Here, in two short sentences, is &ldquo;the gospel&rdquo; of <em>The Shack</em>.</p>\n\n<p>On page 180 when Mack asks how to become a part of the church, Jesus replies, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about relationships and simply sharing life. What we are doing right now, (talking in the forest) just doing this and being open and available to others around us&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>On page 184 Jesus says, &ldquo;Those who love Me have come from every system that exists&hellip;Buddhists, Mormons, Baptists, Muslims, Democrats, Republicans&hellip;Jews, Palestinians. I have no desire to make them Christian&rdquo;. Mack asks, &ldquo;Does that mean that all roads lead to You?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not at all&rdquo;, Jesus replies, &ldquo;Most roads don&rsquo;t lead anywhere&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>In John 14:6 Jesus says, &ldquo;<em>I am the way the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father but through Me</em>&rdquo;. Matt. 7:13-14 says, &ldquo;<em>The gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, many enter by it. The gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, few find it</em>&rdquo;. Any road except Jesus leads to destruction. If there is no hell then Jesus died in vain.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, on page 226 Papa tells Mack, &ldquo;For you to forgive this man (the man who murdered his daughter) is for you to release him to Me and allow Me to redeem him.&rdquo; and &ldquo;But he too is My son&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly God can redeem anyone, but it has nothing to do with us releasing them. It has to do with them believing in the finished work of Christ on the cross and confessing with their mouth that He is their Lord. Forgiveness is for our benefit, for us to be free from bitterness and resentment, and to remove ourselves from the place of judge. Only God is a perfectly just judge. He says, &ldquo;<em>Vengeance is Mine, I will repay</em>&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In Romans 3:25 and I John 2:2 Jesus is called the Propitiation for our sins by His blood. The word propitiation means to appease. It was the holy and righteous wrath of God that Jesus was appeasing by His suffering and death. Is. 53:10 tells us that, &ldquo;<em>It was the will of God to crush Him</em>&rdquo;. He suffered immeasurably to fulfill the requirement of God&rsquo;s just judgment. How can we gaze into the eyes of our Savior and deny the import of what He did for us? This is nothing more than pure unadulterated blasphemy. Nor can we turn our backs on the lost and allow them to die in their sins. Again I will quote from Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We know not who they are, or in what seats they sit, or what thoughts they now have: it may be they are now at ease, and hear all these things without much disturbance, and are now flattering themselves that they are not the persons, promising themselves that they shall escape. If we knew who it was, what an awful sight would it be to see such a person! How might all the rest of the congregation lift up a lamentable and bitter cry over him! But alas! Instead of one, how many is it likely will remember this discourse in hell.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>How can we claim to love God and the thousands of people who flock through the doors of churches every week seeking to know God if we tolerate and even promote teaching that blasphemes our Lord and leads people away from the truth? &nbsp;Why would Christians buy a book that causes such confusion?&nbsp; They should not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In closing, let us be reminded of the warning in 2 Timothy 4:3-4, &ldquo;<em>The time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching&hellip;but will accumulate teachers to suit their own passions and turn away from the truth and wander into myths</em>&rdquo;. Galatians 1:6-10 also gives a warning, &ldquo;<em>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you in the grace of Christ, and are turning to a different gospel - not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ</em>&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>We have a responsibility to teach and proclaim the word of God and to uphold the truth to the glory of God Almighty. If we tolerate anything that deviates from what God has revealed to us in His word, we risk falling down the Slippery Slope (an article by Charles Spurgeon) of heresy into an abyss of lies.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as lengthy as this article is&nbsp;it is by no means exhaustive!&nbsp; There are many other places <em>The Shack</em> strays from sound doctrine or implies errant theology.&nbsp; A whole book could (and probably should) be written to expose its &ldquo;truth claims&rdquo; compared to Biblical Truth.&nbsp; We have only addressed what we consider to be the most critical areas.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the message of <em>The Shack</em> has found a receptive audience, but it is not the message the apostles proclaimed and for which they died. The theology of <em>The Shack</em> more closely resembles that of the Emergent Church than that of Holy Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>On a lighter, humorously ironic note, we noticed (in light of Ephesians 4:14; so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine.) that the publisher of the book, appropriately, is Windblown Media! Does God have a sense of humor, or what?</p>\n\n<p>We hope and pray all Christians will receive this humble appeal in the spirit and attitude that is intended. Not as a rebuke but rather, as an exhortation and plea as fellow workers in Christ, standing together in this great Cosmic Battle, fighting as one united Body against our common enemy and the lies and illusions of the world, the flesh, and the devil; working together toward the common goal of building up and equipping the Body of Christ and helping those far from God to become fully devoted followers of Christ.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~Just a few years ago we had my son&rsquo;s bathroom remodeled and as is the course with those things, there are decisions we&rsquo;d probably make differently given the opportunity for a do-over. I was checking the bathroom status before my son came home for Christmas break and pulled back the shower curtain to discover one of those decisions staring at me in all its glory. Mold. The drywall at the edge of the shower was soggy wet and starting to mold. We already have a handy-man list a mile long with no man handy. This will have to go on the list. Sigh.</p>\n\n<p>This morning I was awake too early, and lying there convincing myself to go back to sleep, I began to think of that mold. How it crept up there while no one was watching. How, even now, it was probably growing back behind that wall, creeping, creeping into a lung-choking mass that will inevitably cause the house to be condemned, after which we will lose our investment and every earthly blessing, leaving us homeless or living in our son&rsquo;s basement while his nagging wife thinks of ways to get rid of us&hellip; I did eventually fall asleep, but fitfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThis morning I had to laugh at myself. Although this is my way and it isn&rsquo;t really funny, my mind works exactly like that imagined mold. I mean really, the moldy spot was about an inch and a quarter at most. I scraped it off and taped the shower curtain closed until we can deal with it. Problem solved right? Right. Except. Except for the creep. The creep of my mind which hops from one infinitesimal &ldquo;problem&rdquo; to world destruction.</p>\n\n<p>Are you a worrier? Has anyone just told you flat out that worry is a sin? I don&rsquo;t actually think of myself as a worrier, but I suppose it&rsquo;s self-evident that I am one. Not to the degree of some. Some people make an art of worry. They have mastered the skill, and practice it ad nauseum, as if they have complete mind-control over everything in the universe and by just imagining the worst, they can somehow save the planet and everyone on it. OK. Maybe I&rsquo;m a bit like that. But I&rsquo;m quiet about it. Most people who know me would not call me a worrier. If they heard what my head often sounds like they would think I&rsquo;m pathological. What I really think is that it&rsquo;s easier to create fiction from fact than it is to surrender control. Here&rsquo;s what God says:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete. You are looking at things as they are outwardly. (2 Corinthians 10:3-7a)</em></p>\n\n<p>Worry is a great tool for our enemy. He keeps us so wrapped around the axel that we can&rsquo;t see which way is up for imaging what might happen if we take our eyes off the imaginary balls we&rsquo;re juggling. I mean, the world depends on us! Stop for just a second in reading this and let your worry creep in&hellip; See how easy it is suddenly to lose sight of God? Our prayers become superstitious mantras that we repeat until we&rsquo;ve made them idols. Our faith becomes self-focused and independent of its object. We have, in one lazy moment of unchecked thought-creep, unseated the Lord from His throne. And this is what our enemy wants. This is the way he wages war against us.</p>\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t search the scripture for a problem with mold (although it occurs to me that there&rsquo;s a portion of Leviticus maybe that might be helpful&hellip;) but I can trace the roots of my fear as revealed by where my thoughts ended up. Because fear is the root of worry. You know this, right? That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a sin. Fear is the enemy of faith. It is its contradiction. It&rsquo;s like thumbing your nose at God. So, what&rsquo;s at the root of my worry about that mold? Security. And where have I placed my security &ndash; where have I built my fortress? In my home and my earthly provisions. Wrong. Answer. That thought needs to be taken captive and made obedient to what Christ says about it. Otherwise the enemy is going to eat my lunch over it!</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how many times &ldquo;I AM&rdquo; appears in the bible? 719 times. 508 times in the Old Testament, 211 in the New. I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s a place where God has said, &ldquo;I AM your provision.&rdquo; No one in history needed to know that more than Abraham did when we see him in Genesis 22 where he first names God, Jehovah Jireh&hellip; the Lord Will Provide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And then there are Jesus&rsquo; own words, <em>&ldquo;Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they? And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life?&rdquo; (Matthew 6:26-27)</em></p>\n\n<p>These are my truths. This is how I will take my thoughts captive. When I let the creep of worry take me&nbsp;from mold to the destruction of life as we know it, with these I will draw my mind and my heart back to the One who provides all things, in whom I trust. Your truths will be different if you&rsquo;re brave enough to get to the root of your worry and find the words that stop the creep. As for me, I will take those creeping thoughts captive and make them obedient to the words of Truth, and like bleach (or a putty knife) to mold, I will wage war with an effective weapon! Take <em><strong>that</strong></em>!</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~My son was waxing nostalgic a few days before Thanksgiving, his favorite holiday of the year. I asked him what he was most looking forward to and typical of men (sorry guys, this one is going to be decidedly gender biased) he mentioned something along the lines of the days of rest and relaxation ahead. I snorted and said something along the lines of &lsquo;must be nice&rsquo;, to which he raised an eyebrow. Ladies, you&rsquo;re with me here, right? November hits and our destiny is the kitchen. Mind, I&rsquo;m not complaining. It&rsquo;s my favorite time of year too. I love food. I love to eat and I love to feed my family. The holidays are my joy and my bane. In my husband&rsquo;s extended family there is an unwavering pattern to Thanksgiving day. The women cook, schelp, serve, and then we clean up. The men&hellip; well they find a comfy recliner or a soft sofa and settle in to let the turkey coma commence. It used to infuriate me. Now I know that we women have the better part of the day because of what happens when we are all together in the kitchen. And I realize that sometimes &ldquo;help&rdquo; is not all that helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In my own kitchen, I have a very particular way about things. (I know you cannot imagine that about me!) I have certain drawers for certain utensils, certain cabinets for certain baking pans etc&hellip; I am very very organized (I can bake an entire cake without moving from in front of one open cabinet and one drawer!). I also have a method when I cook or bake that involves making a hot slinging mess across every conceivable surface, <em><strong>but</strong></em>, I clean as I go, so between every dish my kitchen returns to sparkling order. It is my way. Sometimes my husband wants to come in to the middle of the slinging and begin to &ldquo;help&rdquo;. Can I just tell you how insane it makes me? Do you need me to explain, ladies? He means well. He&rsquo;s a great guy who sees a need and wants to fill it. But I don&rsquo;t need &ldquo;help&rdquo;. He doesn&rsquo;t understand my method, doesn&rsquo;t know my &ldquo;rules&rdquo;, doesn&rsquo;t know where things belong, so &ldquo;help&rdquo; turns into a major source of&hellip; well&hellip; not help. We&rsquo;ve come to a good place on this mostly. He asks what he can do, and I ask him to please sit across the bar and keep me company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Some of you have &ldquo;big helpers&rdquo; called children or grandchildren, and we don&rsquo;t even need to explain that kind of &ldquo;help&rdquo; in the kitchen! It&rsquo;s a delightful sort of help from which afterward we need true deliverance!</p>\n\n<p>So you get my point. I was finding a spark of gratitude deep in my troubled mind when my husband began to &ldquo;help&rdquo; unasked as I was cooking for Christmas day today, and I heard the Lord&rsquo;s words, <em>&ldquo;For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,&rdquo; declares the LORD.&rdquo;</em> (Isaiah 55:8) I actually had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from saying them aloud (in a strident and surely unpleasant tone)! I think that for the first time I may actually have a glimmer of true understanding about this verse. I used to think it meant that God is mysterious, incomprehensible, and bigger than my imagination can fathom. But maybe it simply means that He doesn&rsquo;t need my help. I don&rsquo;t understand what He&rsquo;s doing, or how He will do it. I don&rsquo;t know the recipe or the ingredients, so I don&rsquo;t know what to put away and what to leave on the counter. I don&rsquo;t know when the mixing has just begun or is about to conclude. I don&rsquo;t know if the trash needs to be emptied or if this is just the tip of that iceberg. I have no comprehension, and jumping into the middle only makes more inconvenience and creates new problems to solve. I am sure that on occasion He has wanted to give Himself a good head smack over my attempt to &ldquo;help&rdquo;. Or give me one!</p>\n\n<p>Can you think of the last thing you &ldquo;helped&rdquo; God with? My way usually begins with prayer and telling God how I want Him to solve some minor problem I&rsquo;m having. (Uh&hellip;if I know how to solve it, why do I need Him?) Or I&rsquo;m trying to rescue someone from His sovereign plan for their lives. Or I see what I think is His plan in the starting gate so I duck under the bar and run like the wind. I always have good intentions when I pitch in to &ldquo;help&rdquo; God just like my husband does when he helps me, but do I ask first? Do I stand back and watch, at the ready, but out of the way? Do I praise His execution as He whips out a masterpiece? Do I ever just sit in silence and watch Him work, in awe that He works for me? Nope. I just can&rsquo;t sit still. I feel <em><strong>compelled </strong></em>to help. It feels lazy and irresponsible to just sit by while He works. I feel that<em><strong> surely</strong></em>, I must be needed and I have to jump in uninvited and foul up the works, making messes He has to clean up. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I don&rsquo;t even warrant the affectionate pat on the head and the designation &ldquo;big helper&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m pretty sure He just wants me to let Him do what He does best, in His own kitchen, in His own way, without my &ldquo;help&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to know when to help and when to get out of the way, but I find that as in the temporal so in the spiritual, asking goes a long way. Just ask. And then wait to be invited into the process, willing to do whatever He asks, not what you think He needs. Then if you make a mess, it will be because you really were a &ldquo;big helper&rdquo;.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>Recently, Merriam Webster&#39;s Word of the Day was <em>circumlocution</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>1: the use of an unnecessarily large number of words to express an idea<br />\n2: evasion in speech</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Although M-W&#39;s definition specifies \"the use of an <em><strong>unnecessarily</strong> </em>large number of words,\" there are some situations where it is helpful...or even holy.</p>\n\n<hr id=\"system-readmore\" />\n<p>In Leviticus 22:32, G-d commanded: \"You shall not profane [treat as common] My holy name, but I will be sanctified among the sons of Israel.\"&nbsp; When they heard this command, the Israelites&nbsp;wondered <strong>how</strong> they were supposed to obey it.&nbsp; They decided to use&nbsp;circumlocutions and evasive synonyms to avoid directly using G-d&#39;s Names or titles.&nbsp; If G-d&#39;s Name were written on something that was thrown in the trash, burned, or otherwise defiled, then His Name would be mistreated and profaned!</p>\n\n<p>G-d also commands Israel to talk about Him and His ways frequently: \"You shall speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up.\" (Deuteronomy 6:6-7)&nbsp; But using G-d&#39;s Name that often would make it part of their ordinary, every-day speech. How were they do obey <em>this </em>commandment <strong>and</strong> the one from Leviticus not to profane His Name?&nbsp; Even in their daily discussions, Jews sanctify G-d&#39;s special Name. For millennia, they have avoided speaking the sacred Name of G-d and instead say HaShem\" (Hebrew for \"The Name\").</p>\n\n<p>After Israel&#39;s return from the Babylonian Exile in the sixth century BCE, Ezra, Nehemiah, and the men of the Great Assembly firmly established circumlocutions as the rule.&nbsp; As a consequence, the Septuagint (the Jewish translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek during the third century BCE) frequently replaces the sacred four-letter Name of G-d with <em>Kurios</em> (\"Lord\"). This replacement is the reason why we often see <em>Yeshua</em> (Jesus) and the disciples referring to G-d as \"the Lord.\"&nbsp; Although the Hebrew Scriptures contain a few circumlocutions (most notably in the Psalms), the New Testament records the Master and the disciples using them regularly.</p>\n\n<p>The most notable circumlocution in the New Testament is \"Father.\" Although the Old Testament never uses \"Father\" to refer to G-d, <em>Yeshua</em> frequently refers to Him as \"your Father who is in heaven\" (Matthew 5:16) or \"your heavenly Father\" (Luke 11:13) and uses other similar paternal evasions.&nbsp; He is the first to use this label and does so to distinguish between Himself and the One Who sent Him. Yeshua came <em>from</em> the Father (John 16:28) and during His time on Earth was <em>subordinate</em> to the Father (John 6:38, Hebrews 10:7, John 14:28, etc.).&nbsp; His first-century audience would have clearly understood the picture of a \"Father\" and \"Son\" origin/subordination but \"Father\" is only used metaphorically.&nbsp; There was no disembodied spirit-father-and-spirit-mother-give-birth-to-a-son scenario since no other deity/\"goddess\" has ever existed (see Isaiah 45:5 and others). Unbelievers have frequently mistaken this metaphor as the New Testament writers importing pagan or Greco-Roman religion in which gods and goddesses often mate and produce offspring.&nbsp; That&#39;s not the case.&nbsp; Messiah simply uses \"Father\" to describe a relationship metaphorically.</p>\n\n<p>The New Testament also records \"Heaven\" as a circumlocution for G-d&#39;s Name.&nbsp; In Luke&#39;s Gospel&mdash;written to a Gentile audience&mdash;Messiah says: \"he who is least in the kingdom of <em><strong>G-d</strong></em> is greater than he.\" (Luke 7:28)&nbsp; However, Matthew&#39;s Gospel&mdash;written to a Jewish audience&mdash;records the same event but the Master&#39;s words are \"the one who is least in the kingdom of <em><strong>heaven</strong> </em>is greater than he.\" (Matthew 11:11)&nbsp; The prodigal son, upon his return to his father&#39;s house in disgrace, declares: \"I have sinned against heaven and against you.\" (Luke 15:21)&nbsp; Did the prodigal son sin against the sky or the stars?&nbsp; No, \"Heaven\" was a typical first-century circumlocution referring to G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Believers today often pray to our \"Heavenly Father\" and encourage one another to seek the \"Kingdom of Heaven\".&nbsp; If we speak in these ways, we sanctify G-d&#39;s Name, follow the example of Scripture, and echo the words of our Lord and Savior.&nbsp; Blessed be His Name.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~It&rsquo;s cold! Really really cold for December in Arkansas. It won&rsquo;t last, but we&rsquo;ve gotten spoiled, and a bitter blast like this unseats us a bit and we whine. I was at the library yesterday watching a young mom with three little ones bundle up after story time to head for home. The littlest one, barely old enough to have more than one word, but knowing it well, began to holler, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;Noooooooooo!!!!&rdquo; &ldquo;Noooo Noooo Noooo!!!!&rdquo; The unfortunate thing for him was that as he skidded into full buck mode and locked the brakes, his mama just lifted him up by the arm until his feet no longer touched the floor and out they went into the brrrrrr. I couldn&rsquo;t say I blamed him. And bless it, he kept it up all the way down the sidewalk without giving an inch except what he was powerless to. I smiled a little to myself remembering those days as a mom and sympathizing with the little one&rsquo;s sentiment when I heard in my head, <em>&ldquo;&hellip;you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.&rdquo; (John 21:18)</em></p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a book lately that is way above my pay scale, but I&rsquo;m plowing through. From the first chapter it has been all up in my business and I&rsquo;ve had to put it aside several times while I simmer down. It has held a mirror up to a corner of my life that I thought was a non-issue. It&rsquo;s a place that no one in the church has ever mentioned even in passing in all (the few) years I&rsquo;ve been there. And it&rsquo;s sin. Plain and simple. I am deeply convicted. And deeply conflicted. This is one of those things that is easily justified and argued (which is why the church has abdicated its voice), and I believe that if I brought my confusion to anyone else I personally know to be a Christian (with one exception) they would poo-poo it away and tell me to press on undeterred. That&rsquo;s not the answer I need, but it&rsquo;s the one I want, because I am in full buck mode. &lsquo;No! I do not want to go there! I do not want to do that! It&rsquo;s uncomfortable, and I&rsquo;m scared, and I do not trust You to lead me through this!&rsquo; Followed by crushing shame and a heart the longs to repent, but doesn&rsquo;t really know how. (Oh&hellip;I <em><strong>know</strong></em> how&hellip;I just&nbsp;can&#39;t seem to&nbsp;get my mind from a tantrum-level &lsquo;No&rsquo; to a full-on submitted &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;.)</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing. God never said following Him would be without cost. He said,<em> \"If anyone wants to become my follower, he must <strong>deny himself, take up his cross</strong>, and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what can a person give in exchange for his life?&rdquo; (Matthew 16:24-26 &ndash; emphasis mine)</em> Well, the cross is an instrument of torture and death, isn&rsquo;t it? What do I expect? It&rsquo;s gonna be hard some days. It&rsquo;s gonna be scary. It&rsquo;s gonna hurt a little (lot), and it may even kill me. So. What? So, what, Melissa?! That&rsquo;s where the rubber meets the road. That &ldquo;what&rdquo; is sadly pretty big to me still when I take its measure, and I&rsquo;ve come to a place in my Christian walk where I expect to be able to keep my &ldquo;what&rdquo; and still call myself God&rsquo;s child. I am a double-minded man.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced this before, having a divided mind over a truly simple matter (from God&rsquo;s perspective), my sin nature in full out war with my spiritual nature. I confessed this condition to a friend once when we were driving and she threatened to pull the car over before we got struck by lightning. I absolutely feel <em><strong>torn</strong></em> over this issue, but I&rsquo;ve never known God to abandon His efforts to make me holy when I&rsquo;m in a dither like this. Though I have failed Him in countless ways with compounded interest, and broken His heart by refusing His gifts, He has always brought me to a place where I <em><strong>could</strong></em> repent. I&rsquo;m counting on that mercy again now.</p>\n\n<p>What I want you to hear is that unwaveringly, God is good in the small things, in the big things, and in the monumental things where we are literally at war with ourselves with no hope of Nato intervention. I know you&rsquo;ve been there. Here&rsquo;s what we can both remember,&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on <strong>Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith</strong>, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo; (Hebrews 12:1-2 &ndash; emphasis mine)</em> It doesn&rsquo;t take Him by surprise when we find ourselves here, and He knows where we are going and how to get there. We just need to move. Forward. Obediently. Sacrificially, if that&rsquo;s what He asks. Trusting Him with everything we leave behind and everything we face ahead. It&rsquo;s so simple to <em><strong>say</strong></em>, isn&rsquo;t it? Then we actually have to go out into the cold, swinging by one arm as we are led where we do not want to go. Such is the life of faith. But it would be simpler for everyone if we would go without having to be dragged.</p>"

I walk head down, literally, because I can&rsquo;t see much without my glasses and I need to concentrate! He walks head up looking around, noticing things. He often gives me the play-by-play about the morning dog party, what bird is singing, what neighbor is traveling, and yard maintenance. One thing we both notice is a squirrel plummet. Maybe you&rsquo;ve never experienced this. It begins with a frantic scrabbling sound in the trees, followed by a shower of leaves, more desperate clawing sounds, and then a thump as the squirrel plummets from the tree onto the ground.</p>\n\n<p>We always feel so embarrassed for the poor little thing. I mean, it&rsquo;s a squirrel&rsquo;s job to climb a tree. When it goes so terribly wrong, you just hate to draw attention to the failure, you know? They always survive. I&rsquo;ve seen squirrels plummet a <em><strong>very</strong></em> long way to the ground and they always get up, shake their heads a bit, and then go back to work. But it&rsquo;s awkward.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered what the precipitating factor is in causing a squirrel plummet. It could be anything from poor execution to over-reaching. What I really think is that they just take their eye off the goal. I mean, they&rsquo;re squirrels, right? Oh look! There&rsquo;s a nut! And so the plummet begins. I find this so devastatingly true of people too. Life happens. Distractions hit us right in the middle of a double somersault and suddenly we find ourselves on our backs, sucking wind, looking up at the sky wondering what on earth just happened.</p>\n\n<p>This is where you roll your eyes a bit, because what I have to say here is nothing new, nothing foundation shattering. It&rsquo;s what you already know: you have to keep your eye on the goal in order to reach it. That means, in your spiritual life, you have to have your nose in The Book. You have to zero in on the branch you&rsquo;re reaching for, concentrate on the launch, the reach, the grasp, and the landing. You cannot be looking around at all the other nuts you&rsquo;re missing. You have to pick the limb&hellip;and leap!</p>\n\n<p>OK, so you&rsquo;re not a squirrel. Here is what I mean. I have a lot of &ldquo;issues&rdquo;. I struggle with a lot of besetting sins. So many, that I can easily get overwhelmed with the thought of trying to conquer them all as opposed to letting them conquer me, steal my joy, wreck my testimony, dishonor my God, and end my life prematurely. If I choose <em><strong>one</strong></em>, however, and focus on that one, looking at it closely through the magnifying glass of scripture, I can reach my goal. If I get distracted by all the others, or by the much easier and more hedonistically pleasing world around me, I will miss and plummet to the ground in an awkward heap of arms and legs and good intentions. Oh how many times I&rsquo;ve been there, picking myself up, shaking my head, grateful that everyone is pretending not to have noticed.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d like to say that if I hear you scrabbling for purchase in your tree that I will come to your aid, but usually it&rsquo;s a nearly instantaneous event occurring without warning except for a shower of leaves. It just takes a slight glance to the left and suddenly your mouth is saying things it surely should not be, or your credit card is buying something it surely should not be, or your eyes are looking at something they surely should not be, or your mind is wandering down paths it ought not to take. One momentary loss of focus. And suddenly there is desperate clawing to regain your hold on the branch, the tree, the bark&hellip;anything that will save you from the plummet. I might see your desperation a second or two before the fall, but it will be too late for me to save you. You have to keep your eye on the goal. Only you can do it. Only I can do it.</p>\n\n<p>I think, however, that we can encourage each other in the moments of safety. Something sadly lacking in the squirrel kingdom. When things are going well and life is pretty smooth, that is the time to say to each other, &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re doing really well with&hellip;&rdquo; and name it. We should tell one another &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; &ldquo;Brava!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; &ldquo;I see your struggle to maintain your balance on that very small branch to reach that very pretty nut! You&rsquo;re doing so well! Keep it up!&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t you think that would help? Wouldn&rsquo;t you like for someone to notice you doing well, rather than trying to avoid eye-contact after your plummet? I would! So I&rsquo;m going to determine to do just that. I promise to notice you more for your effort to maintain focus, and for your flawless execution. And maybe instead of walking by whistling after noticing you in a heap of defeat, I&rsquo;ll stop to help you untangle yourself, pick the twigs out of your hair, and give you a boost back up in the tree where you belong. It&rsquo;s what we should do for one another, not being actual squirrels and all, and knowing that in turn we&rsquo;d like for someone to come alongside us who also has sucked wind and won&rsquo;t make a big deal about ministering to us in our heap of a fall. Besides, it&rsquo;s never a fatal fall, just a momentary slip that&rsquo;s cushioned by grace&hellip;and a pile of leaves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

I will skip many things, but I dare not skip my walk or I might never get started again &ndash; a body in motion and all. I have a love hate relationship with my walk. I&rsquo;ve learned that I prefer the blazing sun and 90% humidity to cold, for example. And by cold I mean below 55 degrees. I will walk in the rain without a care, but I will not walk in the snow. I walk on the treadmill with a book in the winter but I try to make myself read non-fiction just as an added layer of self-punishment. Because really, I don&rsquo;t like the walk. I&rsquo;m old. I&rsquo;m tired. I would prefer to be in my bed. But what I really hate about the walk is when there are other people out walking at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never thought of myself as a competitive person. In fact, I played tennis in high school. Well, at least I tried to. And I love the sport! But if I got down a set to what I knew was a better player I would quietly call them to the net and cede the match. I just didn&rsquo;t care enough to keep playing when I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t win. What&rsquo;s the point? Just end the agony and let&rsquo;s go get a Coke! So it&rsquo;s somewhat surprising to me to find that when other people are out walking at the same time I am, I start to measure my pace to exceed theirs. In fact, I can&rsquo;t walk and listen to music because I will begin to walk in tempo, and that&rsquo;s a bad thing for 50-year-old feet and calf muscles. I guess when I&rsquo;m alone I don&rsquo;t feel the need to prove anything, but when I think someone&rsquo;s watching I will push myself to the point of needing emergency care to prove that I can do more than keep up&hellip;I can beat them! It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>Funny thing, though. I do the same thing in life. Something, again, that comes as a bit of a surprise, but on self-examination, I know is true. When it&rsquo;s just me, I&rsquo;m pretty comfortable with the choices I&rsquo;ve made and the order to my life, but put me in the room with someone else and I start measuring. Not them, mind you. Me. I measure me. And usually I find me lacking.</p>\n\n<p>I have a friend who has three children between kindergarten and junior high ages. She&rsquo;s involved in everything known to exist, from PTA to book clubs. She&rsquo;s on the leadership board at church and works with the local schools providing clothes to kids in need. Oh, and she&rsquo;s adopting. Watching her exhausts me, but I find myself picking up the pace a bit even though I know I can&rsquo;t possibly keep up and honestly don&rsquo;t want to. There&rsquo;s just something in me that continues to push. \"More, Melissa. More, Melissa. More, Melissa. More!!&rdquo; Like the blessed little engine that could!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You too? I think it&rsquo;s a common enough phenomenon. The opposite reaction is to throw up your hands and cede the match, and I think that&rsquo;s pretty common too. We know we can&rsquo;t keep up, so we don&rsquo;t try at all. I&rsquo;d like to tell you that the answer to both is to stop comparing, but you already know that, and if you&rsquo;re able&hellip;well then you should be the one writing here! Since we can&rsquo;t seem to stop comparing, maybe we could find a healthy in-between: not giving up, but not racing each other to the finish line either. What I&rsquo;ve tried to do on my morning walks is just tell myself to walk my walk. &ldquo;Walk <em><strong>your</strong></em> walk, Melissa. <em><strong>Your</strong></em> walk. Not <em><strong>their</strong></em> walk.&rdquo; I think that works pretty well for life and faith too if you can grasp the metaphor. God has called us each to a different pace, to different work, to different lives and relationships. He has given us different gifts, and focus, and tender spots in our hearts. He has asked us to carry different burdens, to shoulder different pain, to endure different hardships. Only He knows the true extent of our effort and determination and success, because He is the one who called us to it. That person walking 4.5 miles per hour might be doing it with absolutely no effort at all because God has given them the ability. While you and your three seemingly&nbsp;measly miles per hour is actually the full expression of every ounce of&nbsp;resolute effort you can give Him. It&#39;s <em><strong>your</strong></em> walk. Not <em><strong>their</strong></em> walk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>No one else is walking your walk. No one else knows how hard it is just to get out there. No one else knows about that charley horse that woke you in agony at two this morning, and the residual fiery pain it left behind that you&rsquo;re limping through. No one knows that you really are going your top speed with your finger on the auto-dial for 911, and that you&rsquo;re out here out of sheer determination that you WILL NOT LAY DOWN AND DIE, but you&rsquo;re giving her all she&rsquo;s got! There isn&rsquo;t any more. If the last stretch up the hill does not do you in, you will consider the battle won for another day. And you will determine to rise again tomorrow to walk&hellip;<em><strong>your</strong></em>&hellip;walk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If I see you out there and I don&rsquo;t look up, don&rsquo;t take it personally. Head down. Arms pumping. Sweat rolling. Feet moving. I&rsquo;m concentrating. Just trying to walk <em><strong>my</strong></em> walk. It may not set any records, but it&#39;s mine. All mine.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>Last month, we pondered life and death from a Biblical perspective&hellip; but there were some lingering questions about the \"<em>neshamah</em>\" G-d breathed into Adam.</p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew language has two words (<em>neshamah</em> and <em>nephesh</em>) that are translated as \"soul\" in English and both of these are distinct from \"spirit\" (<em>ruach</em>).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Nephesh</h2>\n\n<p>Here is the first time <em>nephesh</em> is found in the Bible:</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\"><strong><em>Then G-d said, \"Let the waters teem with swarms of living <span style=\"color:red\">creatures</span>, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens.\" (Genesis 1:20)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Nephesh</em> is first translated as \"soul\" several chapters later:</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\"><strong><em>Isaac said, \"Behold now, I am old and I do not know the day of my death. Now then, please take your gear, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me; and prepare a savory dish for me such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, so that my <span style=\"color:red\">soul</span> may bless you before I die.\" (Genesis 27:2-4)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In some Hebrew texts the <em>nephesh</em> has been called the \"engine of life\". Animals also have <em>nephesh</em> souls (see Genesis 1:20 above). The difference between a <strong>dead</strong> animal and a <strong>live</strong> animal is usually very obvious (possums not withstanding). The \"engine\" is not \"running\" in something that is dead. The <em>nephesh</em> is also sometimes called the \"lower soul\". It is the part of humanity that drives us towards self-preservation and self-enhancement as regards to our physical drives and desires. In human beings this is much like an \"animal instinct\" or \"natural instinct\". As such this \"lower soul\" in humans is also sometimes referred to as the \"animal soul\". For all of you New Testament Greek scholars out there, the equivalent word in Greek is <em>psuche</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I mention all this about the nephesh in order to distinguish it from the <em>neshamah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Neshamah</h2>\n\n<p>In Genesis 2:7, we find that G-d breathed the breath of life ( &#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1514; &#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;, <strong><em>nishemat</em></strong> <em>chayyom</em> in Hebrew) into Adam&rsquo;s body that he became a living being&nbsp;( &#1500;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&nbsp;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;, l&rsquo;nephesh chayah). In the Hebraic way of thinking, the <em>neshamah</em> is viewed as the \"higher soul\" (versus the <em>nephesh</em>/\"lower soul\"). Animals, too, have a <em>neshamah</em>:</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\"><strong><em>All flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind; <span style=\"color:red\">of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath [<em>neshamah</em>] of the spirit [ruach] of life, died</span>. (Genesis 7:21-22)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes we see a \"nobler\" side in mammals than we do in fish, birds, and reptiles. Dogs, horses, dolphins, and other animals at times exhibit behavior that is above their animal nature.</p>\n\n<p>Humans, too, can act in a manner above our base, sinful&nbsp;state via this \"higher soul\" because it is pure and created by G-d and allows us to connect with Him. The morning prayers of Jews from ancient times (including the disciples and likely Christ, Himself) include this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>My G-d, the soul [<em>neshamah</em>] which you have placed within me is pure. You have created it, you have formed it, and you have breathed it into me. You preserve it within me and one day you will take it from me and restore it to me in the awaited future.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Imagine the umbilical cord that connects a mother&rsquo;s womb to her unborn child. It is the channel through which life flows from the life-giver to the child. In a similar fashion the <em>neshamah</em> connects us with G-d. Life flows from the Life-Giver to the child of G-d. But in our sinful state, that link has been severed and the connection no longer exists. Yes, we still have life via our <em>nephesh</em> but our <em>neshamah</em> is broken. It is only if we are \"born again\" or \"born of the Spirit\" (as Messiah says in John 3) that our <em>neshamah</em> is restored in Christ that we \"may have life, and have it abundantly\" (John 10:10).</p>\n\n<p>So let&rsquo;s recap: the life G-d created in Adam included a direct connection with G-d (<em>neshamah</em>) between Adam&rsquo;s flesh and G-d&rsquo;s Spirit but that connection was broken as a result of sin. Humanity cannot fix this broken connection on our own so Christ paid the price for our sin and the Holy Spirit restores that connection. \"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal <strong>life</strong> in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" (Romans 6:22) &ndash; We have a restored and eternal connection with G-d&hellip; in Christ Jesus.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\"><strong><em>For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, &#39;TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.&#39; Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.

Or were you baptized in the name of Paul</em>?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are to be unified as the body of Christ.&nbsp; True teachers will preach the word and will not bring the focus of their ministry on themselves, for it is by the preaching of the word that we are made complete in the same mind and the same judgment.&nbsp; False teachers, on the other hand, lead you away from Christ.&nbsp; Their focus is on themselves, as we read in Jude:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>10 But these men revile the things which they do not understand; and the things which they know by instinct, like unreasoning animals, by these things they are destroyed. 11 Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the rebellion of Korah. 12 These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted; 13 wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, the next time you come across a ministry named after the person, beware!&nbsp; Consider that a warning sign the Lord has provided.&nbsp; Again, while this is not always the case, you should be on the alert, making sure this is a teacher who wants to help you grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>"

                 "body": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Nearly thirteen years ago, I&nbsp;accidentally&nbsp;founded&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vbvmi.org\" target=\"_blank\">Verse By Verse Ministry International.</a>&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In 2003, I was teaching verse-by-verse Bible studies when a member of my class asked for a copy of my teaching. I wasn&rsquo;t yet in the habit of making&nbsp;notes, so I offered to record my teaching on a CD. I bought a cheap microphone&nbsp;and&nbsp;was soon distributing handfuls of CDs to members of the class.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I continued to make CDs for a year or so until the volume of requests became too great for me to handle comfortably. In 2004, I decided to build a small website where I could host my recordings online for students to download. At that point, my online audience consisted only of those students who also attended my class.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">After two years, I began to notice&nbsp;<strong>people around the world visiting my website and downloading content in increasing volumes.&nbsp;</strong>Though mystified by this trend, I responded by building a newer, better website to handle the traffic, which led the online audience to grow even more. Soon, listeners began asking how to&nbsp;support&nbsp;the &ldquo;ministry&rdquo; financially. When checks began to show up in the mail, I finally recognized that my little classroom website had become something much bigger.&nbsp;Verse By Verse Ministry International&nbsp;was born.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong>God has an amazing way of magnifying our meager, unplanned efforts into something well beyond our imagination.</strong>&nbsp;I never planned to run an international Bible teaching ministry, and I certainly had no qualifications to pursue such an ambitious goal. I was merely a husband and father who had only recently come to faith in Jesus Christ himself. During those early years, I was preoccupied with living a middle class lifestyle attending church on Sundays while working to support my family. I certainly gave no thought to the prospect of full-time ministry.&nbsp;The Lord had a different plan.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong>After a few years, I found myself pastoring a small church, running a growing nonprofit ministry, teaching several Bible studies weekly and traveling monthly to distant countries &ndash; all while still working full time to support my family.&nbsp;</strong>Juggling these demands for the past decade has been difficult, but the experience has taught me valuable lessons of diligence, sacrifice, persistence and self-discipline.&nbsp;<strong>The Lord has grown my faith and my understanding of His word while revealing the true cost of discipleship.</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">These years have been my seminary, my missionary training and my wilderness wandering, and while I am grateful for what I&rsquo;ve learned, it&rsquo;s time to take the next step in following the Lord.&nbsp;<strong>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce I&rsquo;ve stepped away from corporate employment to work full time for VBVMI.</strong> I&rsquo;m overjoyed for the opportunity to devote all my time and energy to the work of this ministry and to serving as pastor of my church (to say nothing of serving my family).</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Thank you all for your devotion to His holy word and the prayers and support you&#39;ve offered along the way. I anticipate the Lord will take this step of faith and magnify it to His glory, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see where it leads.&nbsp;<strong>I hope you will continue on this journey with me, because He can do so much with even a small step of faith.</strong>&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">With eternal thanks, your fellow servant in Christ,</span></p>\n\n<p>Steve</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~I looked up from just having snuggled my head down into my pillow and saw a dark spot on the wall opposite me. I told my husband to kill that bug. I only thought it was a bug. I can&rsquo;t actually see that far. He gave it some inspection (always quick to save from a merciless death sentence any poor creature foolish enough to wander into my home) and declared, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bug. I don&rsquo;t know what it is.&rdquo; He gave it a swipe with a tissue and we turned off the light.</p>\n\n<p>Next morning, there it is again. Now the geek goggles come out along with the stepladder and eventually a pair of tweezers to pinch the head of&hellip; a termite. I am not even kidding. I can&rsquo;t even tell you... By 10 am the exterminator was in my house.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been &ndash; is meditating too New Age to say &ndash; ruminating on my last article and the fact that I believe it&rsquo;s truth but I still can&rsquo;t do it effectively. I&rsquo;m trying. I&rsquo;m really determined to let God accomplish some things in me, and that&rsquo;s a biggie. Here&rsquo;s the thing: most of the time I <em><strong>seem</strong></em> like I&rsquo;ve got it together on the outside, but there are termites on the inside wreaking havoc.</p>\n\n<p>Termites are easy to ignore because you can&rsquo;t see them. That is, until they start looking for an escape hatch (Let&rsquo;s <em><strong>not</strong></em> ruminate on <em><strong>that</strong></em>!), or until they&rsquo;ve done so much damage that it begins to make little ripples in the flesh of the wood. (OK, ICK!) Truth is, sin is doing the same work in me, and even if no one else can see it, I know it&rsquo;s in there eating away at all I&rsquo;ve labored to build into a strong spiritual structure. Eventually, and it probably won&rsquo;t take much time or pressure, that damage will become evident to even the most casual observer and all I&rsquo;ve worked to keep under wraps will come pouring out. I can patch and paint my drywall and pretend like those nasty little buggars aren&rsquo;t behind the cosmetics, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re gone. It only means I&rsquo;m ignoring them to my own detriment. Same with sin. And that escape hatch they need?? Confession.</p>\n\n<p>I think mutual confession is the terminator of all pests in our spiritual life. If you&rsquo;ve never tried it, I can heartily recommend it. Once you make confession to a trusted (and that is key!) brother or sister in Christ, it&rsquo;s like opening up that infested wall and letting all the critters out into the room for stomping. (OK, ICK AGAIN!) And it allows you to begin to repair and rebuild what has been destroyed. Besides, when you&nbsp;confess your termite infestation, and you demonstrate the humility of asking for prayer, help, and accountability, the other person will feel safe to do the same, and voila&hellip;dead termites and restored strength times two!</p>\n\n<p>I think that&rsquo;s clear enough. And it didn&rsquo;t even cost you $1250. Sigh. Anyone in the market for a nice three-bedroom?</p>"

                 "body": "<p>A few weeks ago our Sabbath dinner conversation turned to deep questions: What is life? What is death?</p>\n\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a solid answer readily at hand. As a believer, I know we should have a Biblically-based understanding of such things, so I started at the beginning of Scripture&hellip; with Adam.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\"><strong><em>Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being. (Genesis 2:7)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Consider those unique moments of Creation when Adam was made. In the time between the formation of Adam&rsquo;s flesh and when G-d breathed into his nostrils, his body was 100% human and 100% flawless, undefiled, and uncorrupted&hellip; and yet not fully alive. It was only <em>after </em>G-d breathed the breath of life ( &#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1514; &#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;, <em>nishemat chayyom </em>in Hebrew) into Adam&rsquo;s body that he became a living being ( &#1500;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;, <em>l&rsquo;nephesh chayah</em>).</p>\n\n<p>I think of it like a basic algebra equation: the body + the breath of life = a living being.</p>\n\n<p>A+B=C&hellip; simple, right?</p>\n\n<p>It is as if G-d zippered the body and the breath together in order to create a living being. Perhaps this is what King David meant when he wrote \"You knit me together in my mother&rsquo;s womb.\" (Psalm 139:13). Someone who is alive has both a body and the breath of life. If you are missing one or the other then you aren&rsquo;t alive.</p>\n\n<p>At the other end of the Good Book, we find the story of the two witnesses who will prophesy for the Lord and then be slain by the beast that comes up out of the abyss (Revelation 11:7). They are dead for three and a half days and then that same \"breath of life\" from G-d restores them to life (Revelation 11:11).</p>\n\n<p>We find throughout Scripture that most individuals die of disease, injury, or old age. In all of these situations, the \"body\" side of the zipper is damaged and cannot stay zippered together. In other situations, we find otherwise healthy individuals who die because G-d takes their life (for example, Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5). The two parts of their zipper were in good condition&hellip; G-d just \"unzips\" them because of their sin against the Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>What is this \"neshamah\" that G-d breathed into Adam? Is it the same \"breath of life\" that the animals of Noah&rsquo;s ark had (Genesis 7:15)? Is it <em>physical </em>breath or <em>spiritual</em>? What happens if we hold our breath? Are we temporarily \"dead\" until we breathe again?</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll take a look at those questions next month.&nbsp; Shalom!</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~My son has been writing for a national online college newspaper. I&rsquo;m so proud of him finding his voice and the courage to make it heard. He&rsquo;s a college student; what first year college student has a shortage of opinions? I can remember the thing I was most passionate about for the short time it dominated the news when I was a college freshman was Miss America&rsquo;s scandalous photos. That was a different age, for sure.</p>\n\n<p>Today Wil experienced his first rejection. Here&rsquo;s the irony: he was writing about how society has told him that his Christian, cisgendered (you&rsquo;ll have to look that one up&hellip;I just can&rsquo;t even&hellip;), white male opinion is bigotry, plain and simple, and he is not entitled to have a voice in response to the culture he lives in. His editors confirmed that by calling his article &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo;. Ah yes&hellip;censorship at its finest.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t know the weight of the arguments, the strength of the resistance, the <em><strong>hatred </strong></em>and narrow-mindedness and reverse-bigotry behind this young cultural movement for &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s so far more than anything we faced when we were 18. The message is that you<em><strong> will </strong></em>be tolerant, or you will be silenced, and if you can&rsquo;t be silenced, well, then, you can <em><strong>die</strong></em>. I&rsquo;m not even kidding. (You can google the words &ldquo;die cis scum&rdquo; if you are interested, and if you dare.) The ironic hypocrisy would be funny, except that it&rsquo;s scary, and it&rsquo;s coming from intelligent people with powerful voices whose arguments sound like, &lsquo;we should all love one another&rsquo;, but is really, &lsquo;conform, or else&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>I know I&rsquo;m mostly preaching to the choir here, but in case I&rsquo;m not, here are some things to consider. If you don&rsquo;t like someone calling you ugly names, don&rsquo;t call them ugly names. If you want your voice to be heard, then be willing to hear someone else&rsquo;s (even if you disagree&hellip;that&rsquo;s allowed&hellip;it doesn&rsquo;t even make you a militant extremist!). If you don&rsquo;t want someone to generalize, marginalize, and gag &ldquo;your people&rdquo;, then don&rsquo;t do it to other people, categorizing them into groups and denouncing them as bigots, haters, oppressors, or whatever, and telling them to shut up. Really, it&rsquo;s as simple as that. By doing anything different, by closing yourself off to the dialogue, you become what you deride.</p>\n\n<p>I counseled my son to pray before he implemented his hasty threat to quit writing for the publication and decide whether he still has a voice that can affect his readers for the Kingdom. He sees revision and rewriting as compromising his own voice, and I agree, but I think there&rsquo;s a way to speak to be heard even in the face of enmity. He just has to find it. And there it is: so do we.</p>\n\n<p>Hear me now&hellip;<em><strong>this is the hardest thing for me</strong></em>!! I understand on an intellectual level that my &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; is lost, blinded, and under the control of our enemy. I get it. But that does not make me love them&hellip;I so wish it did. I am far too much like Jonah, deciding from a place of hurt and fear and self-defense that they are not <em><strong>deserving</strong></em> of Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice, but God&rsquo;s grace is for all. If it is for me (seriously!), it is for them. I cannot withhold the answer to a problem they can&rsquo;t even perceive because I&rsquo;m angry about the characterization I will acquire as a result of sharing it. I can&rsquo;t sit on a hill outside the city and wait for them to burn. I should not even want to. Heaven help me.</p>\n\n<p>I know I&rsquo;m not alone in my dichotomous feelings because the Spirit is losing to the flesh in the push / pull we all experience as we attempt to live in a manner worthy of our calling. I know that because of what I see and hear around me. Christians react to this conflict of &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; with ugly rhetoric and diatribes that are beyond the understanding of &ldquo;those who are perishing&rdquo;. We feel like my son, that the compromise inherent in &ldquo;loving&rdquo; our enemy means that we must condone their sin, validate their beliefs, and sacrifice our own, and so we react instead with anger and defensiveness. We behave as if dissension is a threat to our faith. It may be a threat to our <em><strong>practice</strong></em>, but only we can forfeit what we believe. So if there is only perceived threat, why the rage? We&rsquo;ve all read the end of the book&hellip;right? This particular turn of events should not surprise us. It should perhaps even move us to rejoice that surely the coming of the Lord is near! Instead, we stew, and we cocoon, and we rant while hiding behind our social media shield because we know that we&rsquo;re right in theory, but we&rsquo;re afraid.</p>\n\n<p>Before you can throw out righteous anger as an argument, I will respond by saying preemptively that the only person who can demonstrate that in true holiness is Christ. When we support our sin with that foundation, as if we are justified for our bad behavior and hatred toward our enemies, it only solidifies their argument and proves their characterization.</p>\n\n<p>And let&rsquo;s get real here&hellip;shoot&hellip;we can&rsquo;t even offer <em><strong>scriptural</strong></em> correction<em><strong> in the church </strong></em>anymore for fear of being labeled &ldquo;judgmental&rdquo;. If <em><strong>we</strong></em> can&rsquo;t accept correction according to our own tenents&hellip;how can we offer it, or expect it to be received by a world that does not even share what we <em><strong>claim</strong></em> is truth?<br />\nTalk about hypocrisy.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we learn to speak to be heard? I think it&rsquo;s the age old answer of humility. &ldquo;But for the grace of Christ, go I.&rdquo; Who is the worst sinner you know? The answer should be staring at you from the mirror. You know you better than you know anyone else. If you can examine your own heart and not find the blackest spot of sin, not understand that the whip and the hammer were in <em><strong>your</strong></em> hand, then you are not ready to engage this culture with truth&hellip;because you haven&rsquo;t found it. It&rsquo;s a daily thing, this personal wrecking, and if you believe you&rsquo;re going to say something the world will listen to without doing that work first, you&rsquo;re bound to be disappointed. And they are bound to label you a self-righteous bigot.</p>\n\n<p>See, I believe that success in this cultural conversation begins somewhere at the intersection of true brokenness and love, where we understand ourselves well enough to find love for one another. What I want for myself, I should pursue for my friend, my enemy&hellip;at all personal cost. Bearing all offense. Taking on the very nature of Christ &ndash; a slave to the salvation and <em><strong>freedom</strong></em> of men, emptied of my self, my voice, my message, my agenda &ndash; filled with the purpose of the Kingdom: to plead for reconciliation with God.</p>\n\n<p>Tall orders, but from here we can speak to be heard. Only from here.</p>\n\n<p>Am I there yet? Well, if you could hear a snort on paper it would be here. I am still a resounding gong and a clanging cymbal. I&rsquo;m still angry and defensive and afraid. I&rsquo;m still full of pride and self-stuff. I&rsquo;m hopeful, however, that since the Lord has shown me the way, He will also conform me to this image as I choose moment by moment to release to Him the stuff cluttering up my heart and trust Him with the outcome of seizing the opportunity to speak to be heard.</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>15 &ldquo;Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16 You will know them by their fruits.&nbsp; Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?&nbsp; 17 So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.&nbsp; 18 A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.&nbsp; 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.&nbsp; 20 So then, you will know them by their fruits</em>.&rdquo; (Matthew 7)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our Lord warned us about false prophets, a warning we should take very seriously.&nbsp; The false prophets of the Old Testament would twist God&rsquo;s word, or claim God said something He did not.&nbsp; Similarly, today&rsquo;s false prophets do the same.&nbsp; One issue that has been around for a while is how will God save the Jews, His people Israel.&nbsp; There are those who falsely claim that God has saved the Jews and we do not need to evangelize to them.&nbsp; An example is a <a href=\"http://www.nowtheendbegins.com/pages/deception/john-hagee-and-dual-covenant-theology.htm\">well known mega-church pastor who teaches such falsehoods</a>.&nbsp; In an interview in the Houston Chronicle, he said this about Israel:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The Jewish people have a relationship to God through the law of God as given through Moses. &nbsp;I believe that every Gentile person can only come to God through the cross of Christ. I believe that every Jewish person who lives in the light of the Torah, which is the word of God, has a relationship with God and will come to redemption.&nbsp; The law of Moses is sufficient enough to bring a person into the knowledge of God until God gives him a greater revelation. &nbsp;And God has not.&nbsp; Trying to convert Jews is a waste of time. &nbsp;The Jewish person who has his roots in Judaism is not going to convert to Christianity. &nbsp;There is no form of Christian evangelism that has failed so miserably as evangelizing the Jewish people. &nbsp;They (already) have a faith structure.&nbsp; Everyone else, whether Buddhist or Baha&#39;i, needs to believe in Jesus. &nbsp;But not Jews. &nbsp;Jews already have a covenant with God that has never been replaced by Christianity.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This teaching is clearly un-Biblical and therefore false.&nbsp; Such is the fruit of false teachers.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the Catholic church teaches almost the identical falsehoods about Israel.&nbsp; We should expect this, since it&rsquo;s the same enemy behind each of these false teachers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In December, 2015 the Catholic church published a <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/relations-jews-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_20151210_ebraismo-nostra-aetate_en.html\">report</a> called &ldquo;<em>THE GIFTS AND THE CALLING OF GOD ARE IRREVOCABLE:&nbsp; A REFLECTION ON THEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO CATHOLIC&ndash;JEWISH RELATIONS ON THE OCCASION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF \"NOSTRA AETATE\" (NO.4)</em>&rdquo;.&nbsp; The report discusses several things about Catholic-Jewish relations, but most importantly, they discuss how they believe the Jews will be saved.&nbsp; The way the Catholic church views the Jewish people is confused at best.&nbsp; While the report says some things about the Jews that are accurate from a Biblical perspective, they have it completely wrong on the most important thing, not only for Jews, but for all people:&nbsp; salvation.&nbsp; As we&rsquo;ll see below, the Catholic church is a false teacher, just like others who teach falsely about Jewish salvation, as we saw above.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Catholic report was written on the 50th anniversary of something the Vatican wrote at Vatican II about the Jewish people.&nbsp; Part of the reason for that document, and this one as well in my view, was to help repair the Catholic church&rsquo;s generally bad historical treatment of Jews.&nbsp; Sadly, many Jews even today are against Christianity due to things the Catholic church did to the Jewish people, not realizing that Catholicism is not true Christianity.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nonetheless, as mentioned above, the report does get some things correct.&nbsp; Yet, they confuse other things about Israel.&nbsp; A good example is the following paragraph:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The Church is called the new people of God (cf. \"Nostra aetate\", No.4) but not in the sense that the people of God of Israel has ceased to exist. The Church \"was prepared in a remarkable way throughout the history of the people of Israel and by means of the Old Covenant\" (\"Lumen gentium\", 2). The Church does not replace the people of God of Israel, since as the community founded on Christ it represents in him the fulfilment of the promises made to Israel. This does not mean that Israel, not having achieved such a fulfilment, can no longer be considered to be the people of God. \"Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures\" (\"Nostra aetate\", No.4).&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scripture does not call the church the &ldquo;new people of God&rdquo;.&nbsp; There is only \"people of God\" in God&rsquo;s plan of redemption, and all are saved solely by faith in Christ.&nbsp; Consider for example, Abel.&nbsp; Hebrews 11:4 says Abel was righteous &ldquo;by faith&rdquo;; clearly, Abel lived well before God brought forth the people of Israel.&nbsp; Likewise, Noah found favor with God (Genesis 6:8), again by faith (Hebrews 11:7).&nbsp; Indeed, all through human history, God has built His church by divinely electing those whom He has given faith to believe in Him.&nbsp; This includes all who lived before Israel, certain people of Israel, as well as Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, they do get it right when they say the church does not replace Israel.&nbsp; The fundamental flaw in their logic, ironically, is that they separate how God will save the church and Israel the nation.&nbsp; They do this by referring to Romans 11:29, which in context says:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>25 For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery&mdash;so that you will not be wise in your own estimation&mdash;that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; 26 and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, &ldquo;The Deliverer will come from Zion, He will remove ungodliness from Jacob.&rdquo;&nbsp; 27 &ldquo;This is My covenant with them, When I take away their sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; 28 From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God&rsquo;s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers; <strong>29 for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable</strong>.&nbsp; 30 For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, 31 so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. 32 For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all</em>.&rdquo; (my emphasis added)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&rsquo;s true that God has promised to save &ldquo;all Israel&rdquo;, and one day He will (see our Revelation study for details).&nbsp; But, this does not mean that God will save or has saved every Jewish person that has ever lived.&nbsp; Consider Ishmael, Esau, and Judas.&nbsp; These did not receive God&rsquo;s promise of salvation.&nbsp; Although they refer to Paul&rsquo;s teaching in Romans 9-11 as the basis for this report, the Catholic church ignores the explanation Paul gives in Romans 9.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have Romans 9-11 because Paul had to explain the situation of God&rsquo;s people Israel.&nbsp; Up through Romans 8, Paul had talked about how salvation is by faith and not works, and how salvation is permanent.&nbsp; Given this teaching, the (implied) questions Paul raises are, &ldquo;If what you said is true that salvation cannot be lost because of God&rsquo;s promises, then what about the Jews?&nbsp; God made promises to the Jews, yet most of the nation rejected their Messiah.&nbsp; Did God change His mind about His promises to the Jews?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To answer that, Paul begins Romans 9 by explaining that, &ldquo;<em>6 But it is not as though the word of God has failed.&nbsp; For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel; 7 nor are they all children because they are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, but: &ldquo;through Isaac your descendants will be named.&rdquo;&nbsp; 8 That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then gives examples of Jews God did and did not choose for salvation (Isaac not Ishmael; Jacob not Esau).&nbsp; Therefore, we see that God&rsquo;s promises were not to all <em>physical</em> Israel.&nbsp; They were to <em>spiritual</em> Israel, those upon whom God would show mercy (Romans 9:15).</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indeed, God has always had a remnant He preserved.&nbsp; A great example of this is found in Elijah in 1 Kings 19:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>14 Then he said, &ldquo;I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. &nbsp;And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is Elijah, running for his life, thinking he alone is the only believer left on earth, with no believing Jews remaining.&nbsp; Yet the Lord answers him:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>18 Yet I will leave 7,000 in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were always unbelieving Jews, but God always preserved a remnant of believers.&nbsp; So again, not all physical Israel is the true, spiritual Israel.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But, God <em>will</em>, one day, save <em>all</em> physical Israel.&nbsp; Indeed, this is a promise He made to the fathers of Israel, and His gifts and calling are irrevocable.&nbsp; This will occur in the last days, at the end of tribulation, when He pours out His Spirit on all the Jews alive at that time and they <em>all</em> call on the name of the Lord, at which point Jesus will return.&nbsp; They will not be saved by the Old Covenant.&nbsp; Rather, they will all call on Jesus by faith.&nbsp; Again, you can learn about this in our Revelation study.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite the fact that God will one day save all Israel, the Catholic church gets this confused with physical Israel now.&nbsp; Their view is that Jews will be saved by the Mosaic Covenant.&nbsp; For example, they say,</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Whoever observes the Torah has life in its fullness (cf. Pirqe Avot II, 7). By observing the Torah the Jew receives a share in communion with God. In this regard, Pope Francis has stated: \"The Christian confessions find their unity in Christ; Judaism finds its unity in the Torah. Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Word of God made flesh in the world; for Jews the Word of God is present above all in the Torah. Both faith traditions find their foundation in the One God, the God of the Covenant, who reveals himself through his Word. In seeking a right attitude towards God, Christians turn to Christ as the fount of new life, and Jews to the teaching of the Torah.\" (Address to members of the International Council of Christians and Jews, 30 June 2015).&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This sounds very similar to the mega-church pastor&rsquo;s false teaching as shown above.&nbsp; It is obviously false, as it directly contradicts Scripture.&nbsp; The Torah refers to the Old Testament.&nbsp; In John 5, Jesus says this to the Jews:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>39 You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me; 40 and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Clearly, there is only one way to have life, and that is by coming to Jesus.&nbsp; Yet the Catholic church is teaching here that Jews are saved by Torah observance.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Romans 3 we read:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>19 Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God; 20 because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one, Jew or Gentile, will have communion with God by works of the Law.&nbsp; That is because no one can obey the Law.&nbsp; The Law gives us knowledge of our sin.&nbsp; The Law was given as a tutor to lead us to Christ (Galatians 3:24).&nbsp; Communion with God can only come by faith in Christ.&nbsp; Indeed, Romans 3 goes on to say:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>21 But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, 22 even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Righteousness can only be obtained by faith in Christ, never by following the Law.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Demonstrating confusion that can only come from a false teacher, the report goes on to try to say that there is only one path of salvation, and that is through Christ.&nbsp; To reconcile this contradiction with the paragraph above, they try to equate the Jew&rsquo;s view of the Torah with Christ:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Therefore there are not two paths to salvation according to the expression \"Jews hold to the Torah, Christians hold to Christ\". Christian faith proclaims that Christ&rsquo;s work of salvation is universal and involves all mankind. God&rsquo;s word is one single and undivided reality which takes concrete form in each respective historical context.&nbsp; In this sense, Christians affirm that Jesus Christ can be considered as &lsquo;the living Torah of God&rsquo;. Torah and Christ are the Word of God, his revelation for us human beings as testimony of his boundless love. For Christians, the pre-existence of Christ as the Word and Son of the Father is a fundamental doctrine, and according to rabbinical tradition the Torah and the name of the Messiah exist already before creation (cf. Genesis Rabbah 1,1)&hellip; In the rabbinical literature, however, we find the identification of the Torah with Moses. Against this background, Christ as the &lsquo;new Moses&rsquo; can be connected with the Torah. Torah and Christ are the locus of the presence of God in the world as this presence is experienced in the respective worship communities. The Hebrew dabar means word and event at the same time &ndash; and thus one may reach the conclusion that the word of the Torah may be open for the Christ event.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Confusing, no?&nbsp; Again, Jesus our Lord did not see things this way. &nbsp;In John 8, we read:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>33 They answered Him, &ldquo;We are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, &lsquo;You will become free&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp; 34 Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.&nbsp; 35 The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.&nbsp; 36 So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.&nbsp; 37 I know that you are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.&nbsp; 38 I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from your father&hellip;44 You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.&nbsp; He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him.&nbsp; Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&nbsp; 45 But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.&nbsp; 46 Which one of you convicts Me of sin?&nbsp; If I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?&nbsp; 47 He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just as Paul said in Romans 9, being descended physically from Abraham does not guarantee a person salvation.&nbsp; Jesus makes clear that these unbelieving Jews are of their father &ndash; the devil!&nbsp; Furthermore, Jesus says that these Jews do not hear God&rsquo;s word (the Torah at that time), because they are not of God.&nbsp; Therefore, being a physical Jew and observing the Torah do not make a person a child of God; in fact, just the opposite.&nbsp; Becoming a child of God is done through a supernatural act by God alone, when He causes a person to be born again and is given faith to believe in His Son.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their confusion gets even worse.&nbsp; In paragraph 35 of the report (not repeated here for its length), the Catholic church essentially says that there is only one path to salvation and that is Christ.&nbsp; Yet in paragraph 36, they say:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;From the Christian confession that there can be only one path to salvation, however, it does not in any way follow that the Jews are excluded from God&rsquo;s salvation because they do not believe in Jesus Christ as the Messiah of Israel and the Son of God. Such a claim would find no support in the soteriological understanding of Saint Paul, who in the Letter to the Romans not only gives expression to his conviction that there can be no breach in the history of salvation, but that salvation comes from the Jews (cf. also Jn 4:22)&hellip; That the Jews are participants in God&rsquo;s salvation is theologically unquestionable, but how that can be possible without confessing Christ explicitly, is and remains an unfathomable divine mystery.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Actually, this is no mystery whatsoever.&nbsp; Once again, this is in direct contradiction to Scripture, which is what we would expect to see from a false teacher.&nbsp; Consider John 3:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This really can&rsquo;t be stated any clearer, can it?&nbsp; No one can be saved, Jew or Gentile, apart from faith in Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What about Paul in Romans, to which they refer?&nbsp; Romans 10 says, &ldquo;<em>1 Brethren, my heart&rsquo;s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation.&nbsp; 2 For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. &nbsp;3 For not knowing about God&rsquo;s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. &nbsp;4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes&hellip; 9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; 10 for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.&nbsp; 11 For the Scripture says, &ldquo;Whoever believes in Him will not be disappointed.&rdquo;&nbsp; 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; 13 for &ldquo;Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over and over, Scripture makes clear that there is but one way of salvation, for both Jews and Greeks (i.e., Gentiles, or non-Jews), and that is by faith in Christ.&nbsp; This faith must be confessed, which comes from a heart belief, such that whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&nbsp; Yet the Catholic church falsely claims that &ldquo;it does not in any way follow that the Jews are excluded from God&rsquo;s salvation because they do not believe in Jesus Christ as the Messiah of Israel and the Son of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It does follow, not only for Jews but also for Greeks.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Catholic church&rsquo;s main confusion appears to be centered on their belief that God has not revoked the Old Covenant with the Jews.&nbsp; Although they do not explicitly state what they mean by Old Covenant, from the report it seems clear that they mean the Mosaic Law.&nbsp; But, as shown above, the Mosaic Law never guaranteed salvation unless you obeyed it perfectly.&nbsp; And we know that it was given not for obedience (for God knew the Jews could not obey it, nor anyone for that matter); rather, God gave it to show us our sin, and as a tutor to lead us to Christ (see above).</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, because of their faulty view of this covenant not being revoked, the Catholic church believes that all Jews will be saved.&nbsp; Therefore, they teach that there is no need to evangelize to the Jews:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The Church is therefore obliged to view evangelisation to Jews, who believe in the one God, in a different manner from that to people of other religions and world views. &nbsp;In concrete terms this means that the Catholic Church neither conducts nor supports any specific institutional mission work directed towards Jews. &nbsp;While there is a principled rejection of an institutional Jewish mission, Christians are nonetheless called to bear witness to their faith in Jesus Christ also to Jews, although they should do so in a humble and sensitive manner, acknowledging that Jews are bearers of God&rsquo;s Word, and particularly in view of the great tragedy of the Shoah.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Again, very similar to the mega-church pastor&rsquo;s false teaching above.&nbsp; Yet, Scripture knows of no such thing as not evangelizing the Jews.&nbsp; If what both of these false teachers say is true, then why did Jesus say &ldquo;<em>you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth</em>&rdquo;? (Acts 1:8)&nbsp; Why did the apostles witness to Jews (e.g., Acts 2)?&nbsp; Why did Paul go to the Jew first in each town he visited? (Romans 1:16, Acts 17)&nbsp; We are commanded to share the gospel with all peoples, including the Jews, because &ldquo;<em>there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved</em>.&rdquo; (Acts 4)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fruit of a false teacher is teaching that contradicts the word of God.&nbsp; As we have seen here regarding the salvation of Israel, the Catholic church has false teaching that strives to not share the gospel with the Jewish people.&nbsp; Rather than listen to this wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, let&rsquo;s share the gospel not only with the Jews, but with Catholics also.&nbsp; They desperately need to hear it, as do all peoples.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~So, hey! It&rsquo;s been a while! Glad to be back and to have something to say!</p>\n\n<p>While I&rsquo;ve been on this brief hiatus I&rsquo;ve been busy learning and listening and contemplating, and just trying to hear something besides my own voice for a while. It&rsquo;s been good, I think, though less than profound. Normal is part of the Christian life as well as mountaintops and valleys low. Doing life is sometimes where the best work is done.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been traveling a lot with my husband since his corporate offices and my son&rsquo;s university are both in Little Rock. We have our own room at the hotel there &ndash; the same room every time. It gives me a false security that the germs are all just ours. I choose to live in that reality. Anyway, because my husband is usually there with other coworkers from out of town, I&rsquo;ve gotten an opportunity to meet most of them and chat them up about their parts of the world. One of my husband&rsquo;s co-workers is a great guy whom I enjoy very much,&nbsp;and who is not a believer. He&rsquo;s from California.</p>\n\n<p>One evening while we were comparing notes about kids and schools and etc&hellip;he said that his kids attend a &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; private school and that it&rsquo;s kind of &ldquo;inner-city&rdquo;, meaning that there is a homeless community right across the street. I was waiting for the anticipated follow up about how the school has embraced that opportunity to teach the kids to serve, and the recounting of activities they&rsquo;ve embarked on to do that. Instead, what he told me is that the school has decided to put up blinds on the front of the building so the kids don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;look at that&rdquo; all day. Doesn&rsquo;t help with drop off and pick up apparently, and the conversations that ensue coming and going are largely about how each person chooses their own lifestyle and it&rsquo;s not our place to try to change that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It was a startlingly different approach from what I expected. I&rsquo;ve mulled it over for months now.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I&rsquo;ve been doing while on hiatus is church shopping&hellip;again. I&rsquo;ve settled for now in the church that hosts my Bible study group. They are a warm and welcoming little church whose commitment to service is impressive for a group its size. They have found practical ways to serve the community every single month since they&rsquo;ve been in existence and they don&rsquo;t limit themselves because of what they think a church of less than 100 can do. They just do what they can with what they have where they are. I really like that. They don&rsquo;t look for the glamorous; they just serve the needs they become aware of.</p>\n\n<p>One of the women who leads there, and coincidentally is in my Bible study and has become a close friend, also subs at her kids&rsquo; elementary school. Because our community population is 25% Hispanic and almost 10% Marshallese immigrants, there are unique challenges in the schools here. And lots of need. My friend, in her work at the school, stumbled across a community of transient homeless families with kids living in a local pay-by-the-week run down motel. Instead of putting up blinds so she couldn&rsquo;t see that&hellip;she brought that need to the church.</p>\n\n<p>Today is the Sunday of Spring Break week. This is a week when kids with food insecurity will go hungry because they can&rsquo;t get two hot meals at school. It&rsquo;s a scary week for them, and a stressful week for their parents. So this little church chipped in and packed 60 bags of groceries today during church services. No&hellip;<em><strong>instead</strong></em> of church services. We all got to <em><strong>be</strong></em> The Church instead of <em><strong>doing</strong></em> church today. Anyone who would normally attend service got the opportunity to pitch in to pack bags and make deliveries. Outside the walls of our building. On a Sunday. Worshipping through obedience. Together. The Body, doing its work. It was a marvelous thing. A simple thing. An ordinary thing. A practical thing. Something that won&rsquo;t change the world, but was motivated by love and obedience and gratitude. Something truly profound. I would have been privileged to watch, but I was blessed to help.</p>\n\n<p>Now I know all that sounds like a brag bag, but it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s a call to open your blinds. It&rsquo;s simple really; this thing God wants us to do. We don&rsquo;t need a lot of people to do it. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be glamorous. It&rsquo;s really just about looking across the street and seeing the need that exists there. Need that you&rsquo;ll miss if you shutter your windows. And let there be no mistake, The Church is as guilty of that as anyone in the world, especially on a Sunday morning. (Can you even <em><strong>see </strong></em>out your church windows?)<br />\nOK. You get the point. Don&rsquo;t wait for someone else. Don&rsquo;t wait until you get bigger. Don&rsquo;t wait until you can solve the problem. Just do what you can with what you have where you are. That&rsquo;s Teddy Roosevelt, by the way. Maybe it would be better in closing, to quote Jesus:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Then the King will say to those on his right, &lsquo;Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.&rsquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Then the righteous will answer him, &lsquo;Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you</em>, <em>or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?&rsquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;The King will reply, &lsquo;Truly I tell you</em>, <em>whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; Matthew 25:34-40</p>"

                 "body": "<p>Our God is a God of resurrection. He brings dead things back to life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/story/death.html\" target=\"_blank\">Paula Fredriksen</a>, a historian&nbsp;and professor of religion (though not a Christian), was asked the following question about the Gospel accounts of Jesus&rsquo; resurrection:</p>\n\n<h5><em>Q: \"As a historian, what do you make of this ... the resurrection, of this shared conviction that Jesus had come back from the&nbsp;dead?\"</em></h5>\n\n<h5><em>A; \"The stories about the Resurrection in the gospels make two very clear points. First of all, that Jesus really, really was dead. And secondly,&nbsp;that his disciples really and with absolute conviction saw him again </em><em>afterwards</em><em>. The gospels are equally clear that it&#39;s not a ghost. I mean,&nbsp;even though, the raised Jesus walks through a shop door in one of the gospels, there he suddenly materializes in the middle of a&nbsp;conference his disciples are having, he&#39;s at pains to assure them, \"Touch me, feel me, it&#39;s bones and flesh.\" In </em><em>Luke</em><em> he eats a piece of fish.&nbsp;Ghosts can&#39;t eat fish. So what these traditions are </em><em>emphasizing again and again</em><em> is that it wasn&#39;t a vision. It wasn&#39;t a waking dream. It was&nbsp;Jesus raised.&rdquo;</em></h5>\n\n<p>Dr. Fredriksen recognizes the key message of the resurrection accounts, that Jesus truly died and lived again. Unfortunately, she doesn&rsquo;t seem to appreciate the implications of her own conclusion. What does it mean for us if Jesus truly died and came back to life&nbsp;as His disciples testified?</p>\n\n<p>In calling the eyewitness accounts &ldquo;traditions,&rdquo; Dr. Fredriksen&nbsp;implies that the disciples&rsquo; accounts of Jesus&#39; resurrection aren&#39;t trustworthy or believable. Her&nbsp;decision to dismiss these accounts out of hand&nbsp;is unfortunate, because&nbsp;the ramifications of the disciples&#39;&nbsp;testimony &ndash; no matter how skeptical we may be &ndash;&nbsp;demand more thoughtful consideration.&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Resurrection-Religious-Stock-Photo.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 272px; margin: 20px 15px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Many men have laid claim to power over death, but their own deaths silenced those claims and revealed their deception. And among the few who have returned from death themselves (like Lazarus), none predicted their own resurrection in advance nor claimed to possess the power to repeat it.</p>\n\n<p>Only Jesus&nbsp;demonstrated the power to resurrect the dead as He taught in the Galilee while also promising to raise Himself. Later, He proved Himself trustworthy with an empty tomb confirmed by eyewitnesses.</p>\n\n<p>So who has the power to bring a dead body back to life? Even more, Who can accomplish that for Himself? Is it not the Creator alone? At the very least, the Creator must consent to such an act, which implies that He approves of the One Who receives such power. After all, would we expect the Creator to restore life to a person who misrepresented Himself as God? Surely not, and, therefore, Jesus&rsquo; resurrection from the dead validates His claims. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So let&rsquo;s consider Jesus&rsquo; claims. Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h6>John 6:38&nbsp;&ldquo;For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.<br />\nJohn 6:39&nbsp;&ldquo;This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day.<br />\nJohn 6:40&nbsp;&ldquo;For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<h6>John 9:35&nbsp; Jesus heard that they had put him out, and finding him, He said, &ldquo;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 9:36&nbsp;He answered, &ldquo;Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nJohn 9:37&nbsp;Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is talking with you.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 9:38&nbsp;And he said, &ldquo;Lord, I believe.&rdquo; And he worshiped Him.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Luke 24:44&nbsp; Now He said to them, &ldquo;These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.&rdquo;<br />\nLuke 24:45&nbsp;Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 24:46&nbsp;and He said to them, &ldquo;Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,<br />\nLuke 24:47&nbsp;and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</h6>\n\n<p>As we approach our annual celebration of Easter, the day we remember the resurrection of our Lord, pay attention to the claims of One Who possesses power over death. Note that He declared Himself to be God, to be our means to&nbsp;eternal life and our eventual return from the dead. Most importantly, He declared that He was prepared to forgive us of our sins by faith in His claims alone. Given His resurrection, we should pay close attention to Jesus&#39; claims and then respond to Him in the only reasonable way. To quote Jesus again:</p>\n\n<h6>Luke 12:4&nbsp; &ldquo;I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.<br />\nLuke 12:5&nbsp;&ldquo;But I will warn you whom to fear: fear the One who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him!</h6>\n\n<p>Our God is a God of resurrection. He brings dead things back to life. He can raise your soul to eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. He will one day raise your mortal body, and for those who confess Jesus as Lord, that will be a glorious day indeed. If you&#39;re ready to acknowledge Jesus&#39; claims, then consider Paul&#39;s teaching:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 10:8 But what does it say? &ldquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart&rdquo; &mdash; that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,<br />\nRom. 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; Rom. 10:10 for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.&nbsp;</h6>"

                 "body": "<p>Mention the term \"kingdom\" among a group of Christians, and you&#39;re likely to start a&nbsp;debate. Perhaps you haven&#39;t heard that&nbsp;Christians disagree on&nbsp;the Bible&#39;s teaching concerning the kingdom of Christ, but within the church you can encounter wildly different views of the kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Some contend the kingdom has already arrived and we&#39;re living in it now while others teach the kingdom has yet to arrive. Some hold&nbsp;the Bible teaches a literal kingdom on earth while others maintain the kingdom is merely a metaphor and&nbsp;exists only in the hearts of believers.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/kingdom-nature.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 338px; margin: 15px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Proponents of each view will turn to&nbsp;scripture to find support for their arguments, but how can this be? We know the word of God doesn&#39;t sow confusion, so how do we explain so many different points of view with the Church? Which view is correct?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is all of them...at least in a sense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In scripture the kingdom is actually a concept that progresses through four stages of development from Genesis to Revelation. According to scripture, the kingdom is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><em><strong>A Promise</strong></em></li>\n\t<li><em><strong>A Proposal</strong></em></li>\n\t<li><em><strong>A Program</strong></em></li>\n\t<li><em><strong>A&nbsp;Place</strong></em></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In Genesis, the kingdom began as a promise given by God to Abraham,&nbsp;when the Lord&nbsp;declared that Abraham and his&nbsp;descendants would receive an inheritance in the land of Canaan as part of the Abrahamic Covenant. As the writer of Hebrews explains, however&nbsp;Abraham never received that inheritance during his earthly lifetime:</p>\n\n<h6>Heb. 11:9&nbsp;By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise;&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 11:10&nbsp;for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nHeb. 11:13&nbsp; All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 11:14&nbsp;For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 11:15&nbsp;And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 11:16&nbsp;But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Since Abraham never received the land as promised, do we conclude God was unfaithful to His promise? No, because God never said Abraham would receive the land <em>during his earthly lifetime</em>. In fact&nbsp;as Hebrews 11:13-16 indicates, Abraham himself understood that the promise would be fulfilled in a future kingdom that would arrive after Abraham&#39;s death and resurrection. Therefore, in Abraham&rsquo;s day&nbsp;the kingdom was never more than a promise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Later when Jesus came into the world, the kingdom concept changed from a promise to a proposal. As Jesus walked in Galilee, He proposed to set up the kingdom for the Jewish nation in their day:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 4:17&nbsp; From that time Jesus began to preach and say, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p>Jesus said the kingdom was &ldquo;at hand,&rdquo; meaning God was now ready to fulfill His promise to Abraham and establish a literal kingdom on earth...provided the Jewish nation repented and accepted Jesus as Messiah. Of course, Israel did not do so, and as a result,&nbsp;Jesus withdrew the proposal at a certain&nbsp;point in His earthly ministry:</p>\n\n<h6>Luke 13:34&nbsp;&ldquo;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not have it!<br />\nLuke 13:35&nbsp;&ldquo;Behold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, &lsquo;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&rsquo;&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p>Though Jesus spoke of an imminent kingdom in His day, we can see He was speaking of the potential for Israel to receive the promised kingdom in their day. Had Israel embraced Jesus as Messiah, they would have witnessed the immediate arrival of the literal kingdom on earth but&nbsp;Israel&rsquo;s unbelief stood in the way. Therefore, Jesus retracted His offer when Israel formally rejected Him in Luke 11-13.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the arrival of the literal kingdom was delayed until a future time when Israel will receive their Messiah as predicted in scripture (see Zech 12; Rom 11). Once Jesus withdrew His kingdom proposal, the kingdom concept became a&nbsp;program directed by the Holy Spirit and entrusted to Jesus&rsquo; disciples to carry forward:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 13:11&nbsp;Jesus answered them, &ldquo;To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.</h6>\n\n<p>The kingdom program of the Church consists of believers recruiting and receiving new citizens for the kingdom who will populate it in a future day. The Lord assigned this mission to His followers and commanded us to carry out this program in His absence, as recorded in Matthew 28:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 28:18&nbsp;And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.<br />\nMatt. 28:19&nbsp;&ldquo;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,<br />\nMatt. 28:20&nbsp;teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p>Therefore, we can say the kingdom is here today only in the sense that we have been given the Great Commission&nbsp;program of&nbsp;collecting&nbsp;future kingdom citizens in anticipation of the kingdom&rsquo;s literal arrival on earth. When the literal kingdom does arrive, these citizens will take their place with Christ to rule over the nations.</p>\n\n<p>This kingdom program is necessary to fulfill God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham that through his seed all nations would be blessed. As Jesus told us to pray, we long for that day in the future when the kingdom arrives in full:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 6:10&nbsp; &lsquo;Your&nbsp;kingdom come.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Your will be done,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On earth as it is in heaven.</h6>\n\n<p>On an appointed day, the kingdom program will come to completion and with it&nbsp;comes the end of the Age of the Gentiles, when the Lord will return and the kingdom will move into its final stage: a literal place. The true physical kingdom will be established at Christ&rsquo;s Second Coming, and all those citizens who were previously recruited will become its inhabitants:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 25:31&nbsp; &ldquo;But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.<br />\nMatt. 25:32&nbsp;&ldquo;All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;<br />\nMatt. 25:33&nbsp;and He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left.<br />\nMatt. 25:34&nbsp; &ldquo;Then the King will say to those on His right, &lsquo;Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</h6>\n\n<p>Notice those who enter the kingdom were selected earlier. They are now told they may &nbsp;enter to receive the inheritance prepared for them in the kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Since the literal arrival of the kingdom is still yet to come to earth, we know we&nbsp;are currently in the third stage of the kingdom program. This distinction is often overlooked by some Christians, which explains how confusion has crept into the church&#39;s understanding of the kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s help spread the word to clear up that confusion!&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This is the time of year when many will cinch the laces on their new running shoes, finally put away the laundry that&rsquo;s been hiding the treadmill, and strap on their new fitbit. Many will start their new diet, or the more PC &mdash;but equally hard to keep&mdash; new relationship with food. Or maybe Monday. They&rsquo;ll start on Monday. All diets start on Monday. On Monday for sure.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">A new year gives us a fresh start and no matter how cynical we are we can&rsquo;t help but be infected by that renewed sense of purpose and hope that comes with having to get used to writing a different number on those darn checks. Many of us have spent time no matter how informally taking inventory of all the blessings and accomplishments of the past year, as well as the things we would have liked to do better or ways we could be better.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Prayers and well-wishes&nbsp;given and received&nbsp;for the new year often revolve around health and prosperity. We want the new year to bring us blessings and abundance. I&rsquo;ve done this too, but this year I turned to the 5th chapter of Matthew searching for blessings, so my resolution is to be poor.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be poor in spirit, so I can inherit the kingdom of heaven. I want to be more aware of how poor and lacking the spirit I inherited from Adam is. I want to remember every day, that my spirit is wanting, and that it can only be perfected by the Spirit of God. I want to be aware of the poverty of my heart and that my only riches lie with my faith in Christ.</p>\n\n<p>This year I want to mourn, so that I may receive comfort. Oh, there is so much to mourn, and maybe that is why I find myself numb to all of the things that should break my heart the way I know they break God&rsquo;s heart. I want to mourn the lostness of my unbeliever friends and unbelieving family members. I want to mourn the times I fail to yield to the Holy Spirit and compromise my witness. But I also want to mourn the godlessness and depravity that is overtaking our world, even as I know that it is a sign of the end of the age. I want to mourn our disregard for human life, the perversion of God&rsquo;s word that hypnotizes so many who sit in &ldquo;churches&rdquo;. I have to remember that man&rsquo;s depravity breaks God&rsquo;s heart. As I am comforted in the knowledge that the end of this age leads to life in glory with the Lord, I want to mourn the knowledge that people who don&rsquo;t know the Lord are terrified by the chaos. A broken heart would compel me to share the gospel.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be meek, that I may inherit the earth. This is so hard. We are brought up to be first, to be best. But I want to learn how to be meek. Meekness is so much more than false modesty, or even honest humility. The meekness we need is the humility that would lead the creator of the universe to leave His throne in heaven to come suffer like us, and for us. The humility of the one who stooped down to wash the feet of his disciples while they argued with one another over which of them was better than the other. The meekness that would lead Jesus to let Himself be flogged and crucified even while He had the power and the right to destroy the earth in judgment to avoid the pain. The rightful Heir of literally everything was meekest of all. Yet I find myself wanting to have my way so much of the time. I have to learn to leave my high horse to empathize with others. I have to learn to do dirty work that shows love, even if the people I am serving are oblivious to my gesture. I need to make myself last for the sake of others and suffer pain and indignation for the sake of testifying to the Kingdom. I have to trust that there is a sovereign Witness to my meekness who is keeping an eternal record, and who can see my heart.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be hungry and thirsty. I want to hunger and thirst for righteousness, so that I may be filled. And while this is very explicitly a figurative hunger and thirst, I can&rsquo;t help but think that we are no longer capable of these feelings. In our culture of excess and over-abundance, when was the last time any of us was truly hungry, or thirsty? Food and drink are ever at hand, keeping us in a state of blissful satiety at best, and at worst enabling some of us to obesity or drunkenness. If we never feel physical hunger and thirst, how can we hunger and thirst for righteousness? Jesus doesn&rsquo;t say should &ldquo;desire&rdquo; righteousness. Desiring something sort of sounds like you&rsquo;re okay, but it would be really nice to have &ldquo;x&rdquo;. Hunger and thirst means your whole being is consumed with the need (not the desire) for righteousness. It means your being needs righteousness the way your body needs food and water to survive. So this year I want to feel physical hunger and thirst, that I may know how to hunger and thirst for righteousness. And I want to hunger and thirst for righteousness that I may understand that only the righteousness of Christ can satisfy me.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be merciful, so that I may be shown mercy. Oh, I really need help here. I am so quick to flick the speck off my brother&rsquo;s eye, as I struggle to blink over the plank in my own eye. Do I not understand the mercy and forbearance the Lord has to show me, even as I write this? I pray that I will be better at showing mercy, so I can understand and appreciate better the depth of grace in the fact that God delayed His judgment of my sin so that I could come to faith in His Son and be called His child.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be pure in heart, so that I may see God. See God? We serve a God we cannot see. As a believer I have assurance I will eventually see God when I get to heaven. But how can a pure heart allow me to see God? If I purify my heart and purge it of its selfish desires I can give way for God to reveal Himself. If my heart is pure, then my prayers will fall in line with God&rsquo;s will. If my heart is pure I can see God expressed in creation. I can see God in my daily provision. I can see God in His statutes. With a pure heart I can begin to trust God&rsquo;s vision. He can see everything so much more clearly. &ldquo;Truly, God does not see what man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD sees the heart.&rdquo; (1 Sam. 16:7) God sees my heart, no matter how polished I try to appear on the outside.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be a peacemaker, so I can be called a child of God. I am thankful that my personality is naturally averse to conflict. But the lack of conflict is not synonymous with peace. Sometimes confrontation is what is needed to settle matters. I tend to be more confrontational in my comfort zone. It&rsquo;s so easy to pick petty fights with my children and my husband. I&rsquo;ve noticed that sometimes even if I don&rsquo;t pick a fight with others overtly, I can carry and nice grudge against them in my head. I can do this for a long time. All of that behavior is unworthy of a child of God. I must learn to be a peacemaker, so I can bear His name.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be persecuted, so that the Kingdom of heaven will be mine. I want to suffer insult and slander for the sake of Christ, so that I may receive my reward in heaven. We are living a time of growing hostility toward the Christian faith. Jesus promises reward in heaven for every time we suffer for His sake. As one who feels a tug to go to battle to defend the honor of his country I find myself wanting my faith to be tested, to face the challenge of choosing between faith or lose a friendship, faith or risk my reputation, faith or lose my job, faith or lose my life? Am I ready? How would I fare? Would I stand fast, or am I reflecting the spirit of Peter before the crucifixion? How do I perform daily when the stakes are not so high? Do I give God the glory in the little things? Do I take a stand for God when it won&rsquo;t really cost me much. I pray to God for the strength to stand up for His word and His statutes daily.</p>\n\n<p>So this year I want to be less. I want to be a LOT less. I want to be less so He can be more in me. I want to have less, so I can realize how rich I am in having Him. I want to do less, so that I can let Him be the one doing in, for and through me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Matthew 5: 1-12</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down.

                 "body": "<p>~~Since I&rsquo;m church home-less (again) I welcomed an invitation to attend the Christmas candlelight service at the sweet little storefront church that hosts our Bible study group. We sang most of my favorite traditional Christmas hymns. Since it&rsquo;s a small church, there is no big production-value show for television broadcast. It&rsquo;s just a few simple (gifted) Christians leading a few more simple (less-than-gifted) Christians in worship through song.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I am always moved by the sound of corporate worship. Sometimes I just close my eyes and whisper, &ldquo;Be pleased with your people Lord Jesus,&rdquo; as I listen to the sound of the saints lifting their voices together to the throne. Tonight was no different. &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo; did me in. The thing that was different tonight was the sound of struggle.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever noticed that every traditional Christmas song is written in a key that no one can sing, and spans four octaves? It&rsquo;s as if every common pew-sitting Christian from the 1800s was a classically trained operatic singer. One thing a small church illuminates quickly is the general lack of talent in the pew. If we could sing a four-octave range, we&rsquo;d likely be up front, but we can&rsquo;t, so we usually rely on a really loud sound system and great production to make us &ldquo;blend&rdquo; into one acceptable voice. In a small church, there is no hiding, there is no blending, there is no &ldquo;one voice&rdquo;. And it was really beautiful, the sound of the struggle. As I whispered through tears, &ldquo;Be pleased with your people Lord Jesus,&rdquo; I thought about how our struggle to sing all the right notes exemplified our common struggle through the year to live a life worthy of our calling. We are flawed human beings. Ordinary people, trying to do the extraordinary. Trying to reach beyond our abilities in an effort to please our most worthy king, but failing more often than succeeding. Hearing the note, but unable to reach it. &ldquo;Be pleased with your people Lord Jesus.&rdquo; I think He is.</p>\n\n<p>I think He is as pleased with our earnest daily efforts to live a life that honors Him as He is with our earnest effort to go from the basement to the roof while singing &ldquo;O Come O Come Emmanuel&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the heart that matters. And the audience.</p>\n\n<p>We are trying Lord. Oh, how your people are trying to get it right in this four-octave world as one-octave singers. It&rsquo;s a stretch every day but every day we try again, and we trust your grace to cover us in our inadequacies. We lift our hearts, we lift our voices, we lift our efforts, we lift our failures and shortcomings to you with praise, in worship. Be pleased with your people Lord Jesus. We&rsquo;re trying.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Oh Come, oh come Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel who mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appear. Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee oh Israel.&rdquo; </em>Sing it or croak it, but praise the One who was born for this purpose. He is your ransom. He is your song. He is your audience. He is your Emmanuel. Merry Christmas!!</p>"

                 "body": "<p>There&#39;s an old joke that says if you&#39;re looking for the perfect church and you find it, don&#39;t join it - <em>or else you&#39;ll ruin it!</em></p>\n\n<p>The point of the joke is easy to see. A perfect church simply doesn&#39;t exist. Every church consists of people, and it&#39;s all those people that cause the problems. Church people are often stubborn, selfish, egotistical, self-centered and ignorant - and those are just the elders!</p>\n\n<p>God has chosen to build His Church with living stones of sinful people, but He is working by His Spirit to fashion each of us into His image. The Lord commands us to submit to one another in a community of believers for that purpose, so we can be trained in righteousness. This is a messy, imprecise process requiring faith, patience and humility &ndash; along with a willingness to accept others despite their weaknesses.</p>\n\n<p>Sooner or later, circumstances may lead us to seek a new place to fellowship, and when that time comes, we&#39;re faced with many decisions. How do we decide which church is best? What do we look for? Where do we start?&nbsp;When finding your next church home, we might be tempted to draft a long list of must-have requirements, but in reality you need only three criteria to find the \"perfect\" church:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>1. Does the church believe and preach the true New Testament Gospel?</em></strong>&nbsp; Not the prosperity gospel. Not trances and dances. Not a political speech. Not a rock concert combined with a motivational pep talk. The Gospel of Jesus Christ. And not only should the church embrace the Gospel in their statement of faith and creeds, but the Gospel should be evident in their approach to ministry. Most importantly, the Gospel should be written plainly and visibly on their hearts. If asked, can the church explain the Gospel to you easily and clearly? Not just the pastor and elders. <em>The&nbsp;congregation</em>. When you find a church where the folks in the pews can explain the Gospel properly, you&#39;ve found a church with the right foundation (<em>1Cor 3:11</em>).</p>\n\n<p><i><em><strong>2. When the pastor enters the pulpit, does the congregation flip open their Bibles in anticipation of the sermon?&nbsp;</strong> </em></i>A church body that expects the Bible to be taught in the Sunday sermon is a church familiar with training in righteous from the meat of God&#39;s word. This practice should be the norm in our churches, but sadly it is the exception. So when you look around the congregation, are people even carrying Bibles? Did the pastor&#39;s sermon <em>teach</em> the word of God with respect and reverence and a high view of Scripture? Did he attempt to divide the word of God rightly or merely toss out a verse here and there as window dressing for his three-point lecture? How a church approaches the word of God during the Sunday service will tell you all you need to know about their attitude toward the Bible and their devotion to the Lord. As Christ Himself said, \"If you love Me, feed My sheep.\" (<em>John 21:15-17</em>)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>3. Does the church raise up servants and leaders - including pastors - from within the congregation?</em></strong>&nbsp;Here&#39;s one we don&#39;t think about very often, but it&#39;s a key measure for the health of a body. Are new church&#39;s leaders identified and discipled inside the congregation or are they sought through resumes and search committees? When a service need is identified, does the church hire outside professional help or seek qualified church members? Who performs the worship music and sweeps the floors and cleans the bathrooms and mows the lawn: strangers responding to a want ad (who may be unbelievers) or church members trained and encouraged to fill the need? Does the church recognize that service within the body is a means to personal sanctification or does the church <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/sanctification-verses/\"><strong>outsource their sanctification</strong></a>? Finally, does the church make a distinction between church staff and church members? The answers to these questions reveal whether the church is fulfilling its Biblical mission to equip the saints for the work of ministry (<em>Eph 4:11-13</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Did your church pass all three tests? If not, here&#39;s how to respond:</p>\n\n<p>1. If your church fails Question #1, you should leave immediately. No apologies or explanations required. You need a church that believes and lives the Gospel.</p>\n\n<p>2. If your church fails Question #2, you should visit a few Bible-teaching churches in your area to discover what you&#39;ve been missing. When you find one that passes these tests, strongly consider joining it. Every Christian should receive consistent, sound Bible teaching.</p>\n\n<p>3. If your church fails Question #3, you may not need to leave, but if you stay your opportunities to serve in your gifting and grow spiritually may be stunted by your church&#39;s practice of drawing an artificial and unbiblical distinction between \"staff\" and \"members\" (or between \"clergy\" and \"laity\"), which is the Nicolatian heresy Jesus condemns in <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/\">Revelation</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Keep looking for that perfect church, but when you find it...well, you know the rest.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~I came home from my walk this morning and my husband was watching &ldquo;The Dog Whisperer&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t have dogs, but we love them anyway, in theory and at a distance. It&rsquo;s funny how neurotic they can be. This morning Caesar was &ldquo;whispering&rdquo; to an Australian Shepherd that was afraid of the new baby gate. I mean this dog was <strong><em>terrified</em></strong> of that gate. I missed the beginning so I don&rsquo;t know if there was a precipitating event or if this was an entirely irrational thing. Well, let&rsquo;s face it, event or not, for a herding dog to be terrified of a stationary baby gate is a bit irrational, but who am I to talk. Anyway&hellip; Caesar&rsquo;s solution was to make the dog face its fear. So, you know right where I&rsquo;m going don&rsquo;t you? Uh huh. &lsquo;Cause it was just that good. My husband was like, &ldquo;Are you crying because of the <em><strong>dog</strong></em>?!&rdquo; Uh&hellip;no.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how it went. Caesar would take the dog&rsquo;s leash very firmly in hand, walk the quaking dog right up to that gate, and make it stand there until it relaxed. At first, the poor thing cowered behind Caesar&rsquo;s legs. Then it would peek around his legs but only out of the corner of its eye. Then Caesar would rein in the tension on the leash until the dog was right beside him facing that evil gate square on, legs quivering, pulling at the leash to turn around and run. And it stood there until it could stand there without shaking, cowering, or straining at the leash - until it could look at that gate without flinching. That was step one.</p>\n\n<p>The second part of the exercise was where I started feeling a little something in my stomach. Like this was familiar somehow and profound &ndash; like I really needed toy pay attention. Once the dog relaxed enough to face the gate, Caesar would turn the dog around with extreme tension on the leash and make it walk away. It could not run. It could not look back to see if the gate was coming after it &ndash; and that poor dog tried! It strained so hard to see behind it that only the whites of its eyes were showing! That dog was as afraid of the gate being at its heels as it had been approaching the gate straight on. Once the dog was able to successfully complete both steps, they did it again. And again. And again.</p>\n\n<p>Face the fear.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn and walk away.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not like hell is on your heels.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the One who&rsquo;s walking next to you has<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>GOT<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THIS<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THING!</strong></em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The gate was never the enemy, the fear was. The gate was never what needed conquering, the fear did. The dog was still afraid of the gate, but it had learned to stand steady<em><strong> in spite of </strong></em>the fear. It did not learn to trust itself. It did not learn to trust the gate. It learned to stop resisting the leash that continued to lead it in and out of fear&rsquo;s presence. It learned to trust the one at the end of the leash who led it there and walked beside it to protect it.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve read my last few posts then you know I&rsquo;ve been in a hard place &ndash; a place that has forced me to face (OK&hellip;run from!!) some fears. (Sorry I&rsquo;ve been so gloomy! It happens, you know?). It doesn&rsquo;t matter if those fears have a basis in the truth of experience. It doesn&rsquo;t matter even if they don&rsquo;t. What matters is that the Lord did not give me a Spirit of fear but of power and love and a <em><strong>sound mind</strong></em>. What matters is that He is the Lord my God who brought me out of my Egypt so I would no longer be a slave. He broke the bars of my yoke and made me walk with my head held high. What&rsquo;s important to know is that even though I walk in the midst of trouble &ndash; even in the valley of the shadow of death &ndash; He preserves my life. He stretches out His hand against the anger of my foes and with His right hand He saves me. What I need to know most urgently is that the Lord goes before me and will be with me and will not leave me &ndash; I need not be afraid or discouraged for He is my strength and my shield. He will keep me in perfect peace if my heart is steadfast in my trust for Him &hellip;The Rock Eternal.</p>\n\n<p>In a couple of weeks, I&rsquo;m going into enemy territory where I will face some very real fears. There is the truth of experience there &ndash; experience that may repeat itself. God never promised that what we fear would not come to pass. He said that He is in control. Not I. Not my fear. <em><strong>He</strong></em>. Is. In. Control.</p>\n\n<p>The enemy is shrewd and his weapons effective but even then, God redeems all. His purpose is to make us into the image of His son. That image was forged on the cross where even Jesus had to face his fear &ndash; fear that did not diminish in the experience, but could be <em><strong>endured</strong></em> because of Hope. I should expect no less for myself. I will not escape my fears. I will face them (because He keeps insisting on it!). I will learn to endure the terror <em><strong>and</strong></em> the outcome. Then I will turn and I will walk home with my Master. I will walk. I will not run. I will not cower. I will not quake. I will let my Master teach me to trust Him. I will let Him make me into a woman of power and love, with a sound mind.</p>\n\n<p>Lord&hellip;it&rsquo;s a long walk! Keep a short leash!</p>"

It was our first \"date night\" since our kids moved to college.</p>\n\n<p>This is an inspiring and encouraging movie that does credit to the Kendrick brothers&#39; continuing legacy of family-friendly and faith-friendly films. I laughed, I cried, er, had some sinus trouble in the dusty theater.&nbsp; Two thumbs up!</p>\n\n<p>Just because a movie is \"faith-friendly\", however, doesn&#39;t always mean it is 100% Biblically accurate. Before recommending it to others, I share a few items of concern that I think are worth mentioning.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Issue One</strong></h3>\n\n<p>There is an age old concept that every bad thing that happens in our lives is the result of the \"The Devil\" doing X, Y, or Z.</p>\n\n<p>Grandpa has lung cancer? <em>That&#39;s the Devil at work! </em></p>\n\n<p>Little Jenny has a cold? <em>The Devil did it!</em></p>\n\n<p>Uncle Bob is in jail for selling crack? <em>The Devil made him do it!</em></p>\n\n<p>This kind of flawed thinking attempts to absolve humanity of any responsibility for our actions.</p>\n\n<p>As far as we know from Scripture, Satan is a <em>finite</em> creature limited to being in one place at one time. We also know that some bad things are the result of our own bad choices (like getting lung cancer as a result of smoking for 50 years). The main female character in the movie (Elizabeth Jordan) appears to embrace the idea that The Devil (i.e. Satan) is actively involved in messing with her life. Demons? Mayyyybe. Is there a spiritual component to her troubles? Absolutely... but \"The Devil\"? Unlikely.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Issue Two</strong></h3>\n\n<p>After reading James 4:7 [Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you], Mrs Jordan decides she wants to have a conversation with Satan and give him a piece of her mind including a sassy repartee at the end (\"Oh,&nbsp;and another thing...\"). Throughout the period of history covered by the Bible (about 4,000 years), we only find 3 people speaking directly with Satan: G-d (see Genesis, Job, etc), Eve (look how that turned out!), and the angel Michael (Jude 9... Steve also speaks to this issue in <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-studies/letter_of_jude\">his third lesson on the book of Jude</a>). \"Resisting the devil\" means turning our eyes, hearts, and hope to G-d and ceasing from sin. It doesn&#39;t mean starting a dialog with the enemy of humanity!</p>\n\n<p>When our Lord and Savior, G-d in the flesh, had a brief discussion with Satan during His temptation in the wilderness (Matthew 4, Luke 4, and Mark 1:12-13) it was only to respond with words of Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>No servant is greater than his Master (John 13:16)... surely we should do no more than our Messiah!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Issue Three&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The third issue is a pet peeve of mine: context.</p>\n\n<p>This movie is a call to a strong, active prayer life...I get it. And I can definitely see the appeal of closing the film by quoting 2 Chronicles 17 [\"If my people who are called by my name...\"] but <em><strong>why</strong> </em>must people take that verse out of its context?</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s revisit that context for a second...</p>\n\n<p>After Solomon constructs the first Temple in Israel, G-d speaks to him:</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;\"><em>Then the Lord appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, \"I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice. If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among My people, and My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land. Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place. For now I have chosen and consecrated this house that My name may be there forever, and My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually. As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, even to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep My statutes and My ordinances, then I will establish your royal throne as I covenanted with your father David, saying, &#39;You shall not lack a man to be ruler in Israel.&#39;<br />\n<br />\nBut if you turn away and forsake My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, then I will uproot you from My land which I have given you, and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out of My sight and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. As for this house, which was exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, &#39;Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house?&#39; And they will say, &#39;Because they forsook the Lord, the God of their fathers who brought them from the land of Egypt, and they adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them; therefore He has brought all this adversity on them.&#39;\"<br />\n(2 Chronicles 7:12-22)</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>G-d sets up some pretty simple \"If A then B\" logic here:</p>\n\n<p><strong>IF</strong> G-d shuts up the heavens (or commands the locust to devour the Land or sends a pestilence among Israel) and<br />\n<strong>IF</strong> the Israelites humble themselves and<br />\n<strong>IF</strong> pray in the Temple (see v15) and<br />\n<strong>IF</strong> they seek G-d&#39;s face<br />\n<strong>THEN</strong> He will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land (i.e. the Land of Israel).</p>\n\n<p>There is no asterisk in Scripture that says *oh, and by the way, if any OTHER nation wants to pray in some generic location, I&#39;ll heal their land too. Offer limited to 48 contiguous states and not valid in Uzbekistan (sorry, Uzbekistan!)</p>\n\n<p>This flawed idea has its origins in replacement theology which has no place among believers.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from these few issues this movie is a <strong>BAZILLION</strong> times better than 99.9% of what normally shows at the theaters!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Armed with these words of caution, enjoy the movie!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat shalom!</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~So my son has been away at college for two weeks now.&nbsp;Fourteen days that seem like a year. I&rsquo;m past the point of the persistent twinge in my stomach like I ate something bad, and find myself now constantly patting my pockets and checking to be sure I&rsquo;m carrying my purse because it feels as if I&rsquo;m forgetting something vital. I&rsquo;m going to indulge in a bit of what a friend of mine would call melodrama, but it has a point, so try to endure. I miss my kiddo as if a part of myself wandered off and got lost. I long for a text&hellip;about anything at all&hellip;like the one asking for his license plate number when it&rsquo;s on the plate that&rsquo;s on his car, which is with him. That is the highlight of my day. We talked by phone last week and I was ecstatic to just hear his voice. You can tell so much from a voice. We had Facetime on Sunday and I could hardly concentrate on the conversation because I was examining his face for clues. Is he OK? Is he eating? Is he sleeping? Is he getting along with his roommate? Is he stressed? Is he sad? Is he clean? Is he coping? He will be home in 10 days. 10 days that seem like an eternity. I want to touch him. I want to examine him for breakage. I want to hear him moving about in his room, coming in and out the back door, blaring his screamo music while in the shower. I want to fix his favorite meal and take him shopping. I want him to sit at the bar and tell me funny stories, introduce me to all his new friends, complain about his art teacher, his math lessons, and laundry. I want to know all the things. All of them. I want to consume every single moment of his waking life while he&rsquo;s here (and maybe watch him breathe in his sleep), because it will be so brief. 31/2 days that will seem like a nano-second.</p>\n\n<p>I have intentionally kept my schedule full and have given myself very little time to feel all the feels. It&rsquo;s just too dangerous to give in. I have kept it all at arm&rsquo;s length, examining it abstractly as if it&rsquo;s happening to someone else. But it creeps in. Like yesterday, on the way to the gas station, the still small voice that I have kept at bay suddenly said, &ldquo;This is how God loves you, Melissa.&rdquo; And I could barely breathe.</p>\n\n<p>My first response was conviction. It was like having the wind knocked out of you. You know? That desperate sucking that you do trying to draw a straw-full of air into your lungs until your diaphragm relaxes again? Like that. My absence from God&hellip;my purposeful avoidance&hellip;makes Him feel like I feel right now. In that moment, I saw my role as God&rsquo;s daughter, so busy and so focused on doing life, that I forget Him. When He asks for Facetime, I shrug and say, &ldquo;I guess. If you want to.&rdquo; But I am hasty, and short on the details that He so wants to hear. I consider it a duty to check in with Him, and I check the box until I have to call again. In the meantime, He waits, as I wait, as if waiting is the new purpose of my life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>My second thought, which, if I had the ability to accept love like a normal human being, would be even more devastating, is that God longs for me. He misses me. He feels as if a part of Him has wandered off and gotten lost. He counts the days, the hours, the minutes, between calls, and He watches the time pass as a millisecond when I do finally come home. He feels this same constant ache of loss for His child&hellip;His children. In fact, it hurts Him so much that He would rather die than continue to be separated from us. He would give anything if we would just&hellip;call home once in a while. To know that I am loved even more than I love my son, is inconceivable to me. I have never known this kind of love as a recipient. The emotion of it is overwhelming, and I&rsquo;m not sure yet how to receive it. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m indulging in a bit of melodrama. I want to feel these feelings and consider what it means to be the object of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thinking about how to respond to being the beloved daughter of God, I ask myself what I want from my son in return for my love. I only want him to know how deeply we love him. How important he is to us. How vital to our own happiness and fulfillment. And, if I&rsquo;m honest, I suppose I do want that to have some value to him. I do want him to respond to that by not depriving us of himself. That is our joy. To see him fly. To see him succeed. To still have his trust when he has a need. To still be where he lands when he falls. I want him to come home occasionally and be generous with us, sharing his life with us as his constant supporters, encouragers, advisors, and biggest fans. I just think that there is no way he can understand. He has never loved this way, this all-consuming love that only a parent can understand. He has only been loved this way, and in it, he feels an eternal security that makes no unreasonable demands on him. He has received a heavy grace without feeling the weight of it. As it should be for him. As it is with us. And yet&hellip; and yet&hellip; it&rsquo;s a love that begs a response when we allow ourselves to feel it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you &ldquo;get&rdquo; this better than I do. It&rsquo;s pretty simple, I think, on an intellectual level. God loves us with an all-consuming love. Blah blah blah. We say that. But we don&rsquo;t feel it, neither as those who love like that, nor as those who receive it. And I&rsquo;m not sure we could live every day in the constant wash of that emotion, not productively anyway. I would be undone. On my face in the carpet. Worthless for the day&rsquo;s work. But I do think that we should give in to the emotion occasionally and really receive the love that God has for us as His children. I need to be less selfish with myself and my time. I need to fuel His joy. See&hellip;even writing that makes me nervous. ME? Give Him JOY? It seems so presumptuous, and yet I know it to be true in my own aching heart. He wants us to fly, and then He wants us to remember Him who gave us wings. That&rsquo;s all really.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, maybe it&rsquo;s time to call home, get in a little Facetime. If you&rsquo;re super-pressed for time, send a text until you can do more, but remember your daddy today. He misses you. He really misses you. Trust me on this.</p>"

                 "body": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In late September the moon will experience a&nbsp;total lunar eclipse. A total lunar eclipse occurs&nbsp;when the moon passes entirely through the earth&rsquo;s shadow. The&nbsp;earth&rsquo;s shadow casts an orange hue upon the moon, causing the moon to appear reddish-orange&nbsp;in the night sky. This unusual appearance has led some to call it a &ldquo;<a href=\"http://earthsky.org/space/what-is-a-blood-moon-lunar-eclipses-2014-2015\">blood moon</a>.&rdquo;</span></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Blood Moon\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/iStock_000033953440Small2.jpg\" style=\"width: 231px; height: 231px; float: right; margin: 5px 10px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Lunar eclipses&nbsp;occur at&nbsp;irregular but predictable intervals. The earth can go long periods without witnessing&nbsp;a total lunar&nbsp;eclipse. For example, the earth went 300 years&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">during the 17th-19th centuries&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">without experiencing a single blood moon. On the other hand, since the dawn of the 21st century, total&nbsp;lunar eclipses have been fairly common,&nbsp;with nine blood moons having already appeared in just the past decade.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In fact, over a two-year&nbsp;period, beginning in April 2014, North America will have experienced&nbsp;four such blood moons. Three occurrences have already come and gone, and the final&nbsp;one will occur in the final&nbsp;week of September 2015.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The recent increase of blood moons has led&nbsp;students and scholars alike to speculate&nbsp;whether these occurrences are the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy concerning the last days. Specifically, they point to the words of the prophet Joel, who declared that red moons would mark the end of the age:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Joel 2:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I will&nbsp;display wonders in the sky and on the earth,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blood, fire and columns of smoke.&nbsp;<br />\nJoel 2:31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;The&nbsp;sun will be turned into darkness&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the moon into blood&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before the&nbsp;great and awesome day of the LORD comes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nJoel says that the Lord will turn the moon to blood before the great and awesome day of the Lord. Contrary to some teaching, the phrase \"great and awesome day of the Lord\"&nbsp;does&nbsp;<u>not</u>&nbsp;refer to Jesus&#39; Second Coming.&nbsp;Instead, it refers to the seven-year Tribulation on earth foretold by Daniel and the other prophets. The Tribulation goes by many different names in both the Old and New Testaments, including the &ldquo;day of the Lord&rdquo; or the &ldquo;great and terrible day of the Lord.\"</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Joel says that the moon turning into blood will be one of the signs that Tribulation is near. This sign is notably different than the signs the world will experience&nbsp;<em>during</em>&nbsp;the Tribulation. During the seven-year period of Tribulation,&nbsp;both&nbsp;the sun and the moon will be darkened so that neither gives light upon the earth. Multiple prophets mention this dual darkening, including Jesus Himself in Matthew 24.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">But Joel quite clearly declares that the sun will go dark (perhaps an eclipse),&nbsp;<em>but</em> the moon will turn red like blood (also an eclipse). These signs mark the approach of Tribulation, not the Tribulation itself.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So </span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">are</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> these ongoing lunar eclipses a fulfillment of Joel&rsquo;s prophecy?</span></p>\n\n<p>Before we answer, we should consider one additional, curious detail. The four blood moon eclipses of 2014-2015&nbsp;occur on April 15, 2014, October 8, 2014, April 4, 2015, and September 28, 2015. These dates are significant in the Jewish calendar. The Spring dates in April coincide with Passover in each year, which is the first feast on the Jewish calendar year. The&nbsp;Autumn dates in October and September&nbsp;coincide with&nbsp;the Feast of Tabernacles, the final feast on the Jewish calendar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The first feast of Passover commemorates the exodus of Israel out of slavery, and it pictures Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross for the sins of Israel and the world. The final annual feast of Tabernacles remembers Israel&rsquo;s wandering in the desert, but it pictures their arrival in the Kingdom. Together they represent the beginning and the end of God&#39;s plan of redemption for His people.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It&#39;s not unusual to experience a lunar eclipse in conjunction with a Jewish feast since the Jewish calendar is a lunar calendar and the start of some feasts are tied to the moon&#39;s phases. In fact, a lunar tetrad (i.e., four total lunar eclipses spaced&nbsp;six months apart) occurring in conjunction&nbsp;with these two&nbsp;Jewish feasts is not unprecedented either. This pattern has occurred&nbsp;at least 8 times in the past 2,100 years.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Still, given the sudden prevalence of full&nbsp;lunar eclipses and their alignment with significant Jewish feasts, Bible scholars wonder if we&#39;re witnessing the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">fulfillment of Joel&#39;s prophecy.&nbsp;Do they indicate&nbsp;the approach of Tribulation and the other events associated with the end of the Age? Or are they meaningless?</span></p>\n\n<p>If these moons were appearing absent other prophetic fulfillment, then we would be justified in dismissing&nbsp;them as inconclusive, but they are not isolated signs. Numerous other significant end times signs have been fulfilled over the past century or are being fulfilled today, including two world wars (fulfilling Matt 24:7), the reemergence of Israel in her land (Matt 24:32), the increasing frequency of earthquakes and famines (Luke 21:11), and the apostasy of the church (2Thess 2:3). (You can learn more about the signs of the end in our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation study</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Taken together, all signs point to the approaching end of this age, and in light of this growing body of evidence, we believe it&#39;s reasonable to conclude that&nbsp;the coming lunar eclipses&nbsp;(along with those of the past century) are&nbsp;fulfilling&nbsp;Joel&#39;s prophecy. Notice that other signs in Joel&#39;s prophecy&nbsp;have yet to be fulfilled, so we are not suggesting that these eclipses mean the Tribulation is <em>imminent,</em>&nbsp;only that it&nbsp;is approaching.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Nevertheless, the world and even many Christians will fail to heed these signs, as Jesus warned in His day:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 16:1&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and testing Jesus, they&nbsp;&nbsp;asked Him to show them a&nbsp;&nbsp;sign from heaven.&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 16:2&nbsp; But He replied to them,&ldquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is evening, you say, &lsquo;It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 16:3&nbsp;&ldquo;And in the morning, &lsquo;There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and threatening.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how to discern the&nbsp;appearance of the sky, but cannot discern the signs of the times?</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Jesus criticized the unbelieving Pharisees for their unwillingness to recognize the obvious signs He was showing them. Ironically, Jesus chose as His analogy the practice of&nbsp;predicting the weather&nbsp;by watching&nbsp;atmospheric signs in the sky. While the Pharisees&nbsp;could detect subtle changes in the heavens and predict weather patterns, they were unable (i.e., unwilling) to recognize clear and unmistakable signs that the Messiah had come.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Likewise, today men will take note of the rare appearance of these moons, the unique alignment with important Jewish feasts and the prophecy given in Joel, yet will walk away unconvinced. We are called to live with eyes for eternity, so we can recognize these signs and be prepared for our Lord&rsquo;s return. As Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 24:32&nbsp; &ldquo;Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near;</span><br />\nMatt. 24:33 &nbsp;so, you too, when you see all these things,&nbsp;recognize that&nbsp;&nbsp;He is near, right at the&nbsp;&nbsp;door.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in learning more about the signs of the times, consider listening to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation&nbsp;Bible study</a> available in our Bible Studies section.&nbsp;</p>"

Immorality is celebrated, piety is mocked and anything goes. As our social fabric frays, many Christians struggle with how to keep our message relevant while protecting our right to participate freely in the marketplace of ideas. For the first time, many fear persecution.</p>\n\n<p>As a Christian ministry operating in the midst of this upheaval, it&rsquo;s easy to lose focus. We could detour from teaching the Bible into timely political discourse or social commentary. We could dispense with book studies to examine the roots of these movements, to predict future outcomes and to offer possible antidotes. Certainly, we would have much to say on these matters, and I know we would say it with passion and conviction. And perhaps some in the culture might even listen.</p>\n\n<p>But we won&rsquo;t. We don&rsquo;t need to. The Lord has already spoken, and His word is clear enough.</p>\n\n<p>Our mission is to teach the word of God &ndash; methodically, unrelentingly, and consistently &ndash; and to do so for the reasons God ordained: to persuade the unbeliever to the truth of the Gospel and to equip the saints for the work of ministry. We will continue doing this because it&rsquo;s the&nbsp;only&nbsp;solution for society&rsquo;s ills.</p>\n\n<p>Each new terrorist act, economic calamity or court decision only serves to strengthen our resolve to preach the word in season or out of season. As Jesus Himself taught:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 16:31&nbsp;&ldquo;But he said to him, &lsquo;If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nFriends, if the world will not listen to the word of God, then we have nothing better we can offer. Teaching the word of God is the only thing that will rescue men and women from sin and rebellion and lead them to salvation at the cross of Jesus. The word of God is the power of God to those who are being saved, so a thousand volumes of political commentary cannot equal one verse of scripture. So we will preach the word.</p>\n\n<p>I am sincerely thankful to all those who have chosen to favor this ministry with prayers and donations, and I assume they do so because they also agree with the importance of teaching scripture. They make it possible for us to reach millions with the word of God, and I assure them &ndash; and everyone &ndash; we will never deviate from that mission until the Lord returns or brings us home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>May the Lord return soon, and may He bless your devotion to His holy word.</p>\n\n<p>Steve</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~I&rsquo;ve just wrapped up a short summer study with my Bible study group where we allowed Jesus to confront us with some hard questions. He asked us, &ldquo;Who do you say I am?&rdquo; What are you looking for?&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you want me to do for you?&rdquo; And, &ldquo;Does this offend you? You do not want to leave too, do you?&rdquo; Well, I guess that technically makes 5 questions but we answered both of those last two with Peter&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I have to confess that this was a tough study for me. As a teacher I feel the burden of confronting these things myself before I ask my group to do it. It&rsquo;s hard stuff. And, while Jesus was not surprised by my answers, I surely was. Today, I realized that He&rsquo;s asked me another one. This one isn&rsquo;t found directly in scripture. It&rsquo;s just for me (except as I find myself moved to share it with you!). It&rsquo;s quiet, and penetrating, and I have not yet allowed it to go deep enough to answer. In fact, I am powerless to answer right now, but He is gracious to begin asking now in preparation.</p>\n\n<p>My son is leaving for college in 23 days. Don&rsquo;t tune me out. Hang in for the ending. Like my friends, roll your eyes, pat my hand, and stay with me!! I have to explain some of this for you to truly understand, and even then you won&rsquo;t, but I will give it a go anyway. &hellip; and here I sit waiting for a beginning to present itself on the page. I don&rsquo;t know where to start. I guess, I would say that I am very close to my son. If you&rsquo;ve been reading for any time at all, you know that when Wil was small we discovered that he had cancer. That began a bonding of sorts between us that exceeds what other parents typically experience. I almost feel like I birthed him twice, after carrying him twice. And &ldquo;carrying&rdquo; him through chemotherapy was harder and longer. Psychologists would say, peering critically over their glasses, that I am enmeshed with my son.</p>\n\n<p>When Wil was four, I became a true follower of Christ, and shortly thereafter, Jesus set me free from the corporate world. Yes. I continued to work part-time the whole year Wil was in chemo. Then the Lord sent me home. To live every single day with a 4-year-old. Every. Day. Alone. With a 4-year-old. I had no idea what to do. I never wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. I was completely freaked. I could not comprehend what had happened to my purpose, my identity, my significance. It wasn&rsquo;t that I had loved my job. I hadn&rsquo;t. I hated it. I hated working. But&hellip;this. This was not something I had ever imagined for myself, and I was too afraid to love it. Gladly, that didn&rsquo;t last long. Within 6 months, I couldn&rsquo;t imagine anything MORE purposeful, MORE significant, and I loved that my identity was now &ldquo;mom&rdquo;. I know. Stay with me.</p>\n\n<p>That was 14 years ago. I filled every unforgiving minute of those 14 years with 60 seconds worth of distance run! I loved my mom-job, and because I have always been secretly quite ambitious, I set out to be the BEST at my job. If there were awards&hellip;that&rsquo;s what I was shooting for. Scripture says, &ldquo;her children rise up and call her blessed&rdquo;. That was the goal. And though I&rsquo;ve yet to hear the words, I think I met the challenge. I (OK&hellip;credit where due&hellip;WE) raised a great kid. I could not&nbsp; be more proud. Wil is truly a blessing to me and his dad. If we could have written a &ldquo;perfect kid&rdquo; recipe as parents, Wil would have been the result. We never experience rebellion. He has always been uber-obedient. He sets high standards for himself and tries hard to meet those standards. He&rsquo;s not perfect&hellip;his politics are questionable, and he likes to be the Junior Holy Spirit convicting the whole world of sin, but I know there are great things ahead for him and I am thrilled with excitement at the prospect of who he will become and what he will experience.&nbsp; And I am positively sick at heart.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">What. Now?</p>\n\n<p>I have never had to confront my identity separate from&hellip;anything. Always, I&rsquo;ve latched on to the next thing that I could throw myself into. I am fearful for the nice people at the Children&rsquo;s Shelter and for my Bible study group because&hellip;well&hellip;they&rsquo;re next! Unless&hellip;unless I can sit quietly in the dust at my Master&rsquo;s feet and answer His question.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;Am I enough?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m too scared to answer right now. That nothingness of purpose, significance, and identity seems a vast and empty darkness looming as I hurtle toward its shadow. I don&rsquo;t know what lurks there. I don&rsquo;t know how to anticipate having my heart and soul and life and reason for rising in the morning abruptly removed. (And let me just tell you that the words I want to use here but didn&rsquo;t for fear of melodrama are: sucked, amputated, severed, ripped, and pried-from-my-cold dead-hands!) He is my first. He is my last. He is my only.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&ldquo;Am. I. Enough?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Only by your own power, Lord. You gave me a heart for this child that burns with an all-consuming fire. Your heart. You wrapped my days and nights around him. You planted the seed in my heart that grew and bore sweet fruit. You blessed my obedience, redeemed my past, empowered my weaknesses, overcame my insecurities. You made me fierce and fearless. You made me tender. You spoke when I had no words. You healed when I could only nurse. You worked when I could only pray. You went ahead when I could only follow. You hold all that I treasure in your hands&hellip;and I surrender him to you. Are you enough? Are you enough for him? Will you be enough for me when he is gone?</p>\n\n<p>Fellow traveler, I am aware of the theology gaps (and the sin!) in what I&rsquo;ve confessed to you. I know my identity is in Christ&hellip;my purpose, my significance&hellip;and I hope that you do too. I hope you know it better than I do. I hope your heart knows it, because that is the work ahead of me. Teaching my heart to know what my head understands in theory. I also know that only a handful of you may be where I am right now, but I bet every one of you is facing a big black gaping unknown of some sort where Jesus is standing at the precipice asking you, &ldquo;Am I enough?&rdquo; We all have to answer at some point, and then live to tell about it. Because we know that HE IS, and that this is His story&hellip;His glory. But our hearts tremble with the thought of the unknown, the surety of the pain, and the effort that lies ahead to just get&hellip;out&hellip;of&hellip;bed and&hellip;what? For me&hellip;walk past that empty room. For you? That is your own gap to fill. For Him to fill. And I pray that we will all find it filled &ndash; poured out, pressed down, shaken together, and running over &ndash; with the very presence of God.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">He is enough.</p>\n\n<p>(Just a last thought. I&rsquo;ve done the math, and as near as I can remember this marks the 8th year I&rsquo;ve been contributing to Verse by Verse since Pastor Armstrong said that he felt the site needed someone to write to the &ldquo;soccer moms&rdquo;. HA! I&rsquo;m not sure I ever did that, but for sure, now I&rsquo;ve run out of those carpool mini-van days. I hope you all will stick with me now that I&rsquo;ve left the soccer field, the classroom, and crossed the stage to &ldquo;Pomp and Circumstance&rdquo;.&nbsp; Consider this post the launching pad for the next &ldquo;adventure&rdquo; &ndash;we&rsquo;re going to call it that in faith! I hope the Lord will continue to bless me with material and words to say that find you where I am too. Many blessings&hellip;Melissa)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">God does not believe in democracy.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I hope that doesn&rsquo;t come as a shock to you, especially if you are a dedicated student of God&rsquo;s word. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I love living in America and being a US citizen. It is undeniable that we have been blessed to live in a country where so far we have been able to personally embrace the faith God has breathed into us, largely without persecution or opposition.&nbsp;But&nbsp;it baffles me how many Christians, especially American Christians have so inextricably linked their faith with their patriotism that it is hard to see any boundary between the two.</span></p>\n\n<p>When we look at things with God&rsquo;s eyes, we will find that the many categories and distinctions we invent as human beings are greatly reduced and simplified. Where we see Baptists, Presbyterians, &ldquo;Non-denominationals&rdquo;, God sees ONE church comprised of a subset of individuals &mdash;only the ones sealed with the Holy Spirit&mdash; who identify themselves with each of those labels. Where we see Jew, African, Latin-American, European, Asian, Caucasian, Black, etc., scripture clarifies the only two categories are Jew and Gentile (i.e. not Jew). In God&rsquo;s eyes there are only two kinds of government: His government (a Theocracy), and democracies of various different flavors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Democracy is quintessentially defined as &ldquo;a government of the people, by the people and for the people.&rdquo; You can travel the entire globe and you will not find a single government that does not fit this definition. All earthly governments have been invented by people, they are run by people and are established to serve, you guessed it, people. They only differ in how many &lsquo;people&rsquo;s&rsquo; interests are actually represented.</p>\n\n<p>So it should come as no surprise to you when your beloved democracy fails to uphold the Biblical values that define you as a Christian. Brothers and sisters, yes, God&rsquo;s hand was mightily involved in the formation of the United States, just as much as He was involved in the establishment of all nations:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Daniel 2:21</strong><br />\n<strong><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;It is He who changes the times and the epochs;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">He removes kings and establishes kings;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">He gives wisdom to wise men</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And knowledge to men of understanding.&rdquo;</span></em></strong></p>\n\n<p>And, yes, the founding fathers subscribed to moral values and ethics, most of which aligned with Biblical principles. That does not make the US a &ldquo;Christian country&rdquo;. A democracy, as we define it, is essentially a human (and humanistic) government with its roots in the very pagan&nbsp;Greek and Roman civilizations. Anything human in origin is by definition sinful and corrupt. It eventually decays and crumbles from within, <strong>because</strong> of its very essence. Simply put, a&nbsp;government by people is not led by God.</p>\n\n<p>Do you want an example from scripture? We have only to look at Israel, a <strong>PEOPLE</strong> hand-selected and anointed by God. At every turn they forsook and opposed the leading of their pillar of cloud and fire (God&rsquo;s very presence, which later dwelt among them in the Tabernacle and Templ), and sought to build their nation based on alliances with the Canaanites who led them into rampant idolatry. These same people eschewed God&rsquo;s leadership and clamored to be ruled by human kings. That experiment did not end well.</p>\n\n<p>When you celebrate your country&rsquo;s freedom, do be thankful for all you have been given and for the country where you live, but remember that your thanks ought to be directed principally to the God who provided for you this portion on earth. Celebrate the freedom in your country with your eyes open,&nbsp;considering that we define freedom in human terms, and that freedom is a double-edged sword. It equally protects those who would&nbsp;use our lips to bless God as much as those would would use their lips to curse Him. It gives us the freedom to elect people who uphold Biblical principles, or just as easily to elect those who deny God&rsquo;s existence and proclaim&nbsp;the absence of any moral statutes. When the choice is left in the hands of people, people will follow their sinful nature. There is none righteous, no not one. No one seeks after God. (Romans 3:10-11)</p>\n\n<p>When you look at your faith and your country, can you clearly see the distinction? What is your citizenship? Are you an American who believes in Christ, or are you a Christian who lives in America?</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at Paul&rsquo;s warning to the Philipians. Don&rsquo;t focus on the earthly things as those who follow their own appetite do. Your citizenship is in Heaven.&nbsp;Our focus needs to be on eternity. Our lives need to reflect the peace of the knowledge we have received.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Philipians 3:18-21</strong><br />\n<em><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">18&nbsp;For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ, 19&nbsp;whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things. 20&nbsp;For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; 21&nbsp;who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.</span></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>At the end of the age, Christ Jesus, the &ldquo;King of Kings and Lord of Lords&rdquo; is coming to establish a government. It will most definitely NOT be a democracy. Isaiah 9:6 tells us &ldquo;the government shall be upon His shoulder.&rdquo; The whole government, all of it, what Jesus says goes. There will be no voting; nothing will be ruled by committee. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; from the mouth of God; no gray areas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I am infinitely grateful that I have been given the unmerited gift of trading my paper passport for the one that will allow me to enjoy the boundless peace, joy and prosperity that awaits us in God&rsquo;s Kingdom.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~<u><strong>Author&rsquo;s pre-ramble</strong></u><br />\n<strong>I wrote the following article a couple of years ago, so I realize that it&rsquo;s dated in context. However, you will quickly understand the issue, and the timely discussion that follows&hellip;I trust you to see the bigger message that came from a small less-than-relevant-or-noteworthy event of a moment and how it applies to a very important and relevant dialogue taking place in our country right now. As always&hellip;read at your own risk, knowing that I&rsquo;m with you at the mirror.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>You may have heard about Adam Levine&rsquo;s unfortunate faux pas on national television this week. (Don&rsquo;t tune out now even if you have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about!!) He muttered a comment under his breath in an obviously emotional moment that revealed his heart. He said, &ldquo;I hate this country&rdquo;. If you watch <u>The Voice</u>, you know how intense the eliminations can get and how attached these judges are to their contestants. Adam&rsquo;s comment revealed his commitment to and respect for his team. It also revealed his bias and his humanity.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing. Adam has taken a very vocal stand in his personal and professional life&nbsp;against the intolerance he sees in other places and people, and he practices an attitude of tolerance. He seems to be a truly, genuinely nice guy; the appearance of tolerance is certainly attractive. The problem is that it&rsquo;s a lie. None of us is truly tolerant. Adam&rsquo;s comments expose the lie for what it is. What he really said, reading between the lines, was, &lsquo;I hate that people liked country music more than what my team sang today&rsquo;. &lsquo;I hate the diversity represented by the democratic process&rsquo;.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hate that not everyone thinks the way I do, nor shares my taste in music&rsquo;. &lsquo;I hate that I did not get my way because other people are different from me.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That is not tolerance. It&rsquo;s&hellip;preference&hellip;partiality&hellip;prejudice. These are traits common to the human condition, but (pardon my personal opinion here) this is a truth that a tolerant philosophy will not own. Humility is required in order to admit that we favor certain people over others and dislike entire groups of people for no good reason. Just try admitting it out loud in your next Bible study meeting and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean! (Oh&hellip;did you think I was talking about &ldquo;them&rdquo; and not you?) Jesus condemned this attitude of partiality as sin &ndash; God condemned it long before Jesus came. If a tendency to show partiality didn&rsquo;t exist within us, it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth mentioning, would it?</p>\n\n<p>Get real with me here. If you will shake out your ruffled feathers for a minute, I&rsquo;ll bet you could easily name 10 groups of people you dislike or who make you suspicious.</p>\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;Bad drivers<br />\n2.&nbsp;People who talk too loudly on their cell phones in public<br />\n3.&nbsp;Teenagers<br />\n4.&nbsp;People who are overweight (ouch)<br />\n5.&nbsp;Muslims (now we&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; real)<br />\n6.&nbsp;Liberals /conservatives<br />\n7.&nbsp;Democrats /Republicans<br />\n8.&nbsp;The president (too close to home??)<br />\n9.&nbsp;Illegal aliens (hurt your feelings now??)<br />\n10.&nbsp;Unbelievers (you know it&rsquo;s true - just think Chik-fil-A!)</p>\n\n<p>Plus car salesmen, &lsquo;customer service&rsquo; reps, those people selling magazines door to door, insurance salesmen, computer hackers, telephone solicitors, financial planners, men who work in day care, Catholics and the whole Catholic establishment, people with tattoos and nose rings, school administrators, the Los Angeles police department, Disney, New Orleans &ndash;all of it &ndash;, televangelists, faith-healers, prosperity preachers, Joyce Meyer, Calvinists and Armenians (take your pick) people who don&rsquo;t know the difference between there/their/they&rsquo;re, people who can&rsquo;t form possessives using apostrophes (is this just me?), stay at home dads, working moms, the press. The list is as unique as the person making it, but we all have one &ndash; a list of people toward whom we are surely intolerant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The problem with wearing an air of tolerance (whether as a part of your Christian practice or otherwise) is that when you have one of those difficult encounters with diversity, your tolerance is unmasked and revealed to be prideful hypocrisy and false humility. There&rsquo;s no backpedaling. What Adam said was not so much, &ldquo;I hate my country&rdquo; as it was, &lsquo;I hate people who are different from me&rsquo;. Making him as intolerant as the guy he points his finger at. And if you just thought something along the lines of, &ldquo;Yeah! All that and a bag of chips!&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ve just revealed your own intolerance for Adam and people like Adam. Making you as misguided as you think he is. Shazam.</p>\n\n<p>We would all &ndash; believer and unbeliever alike &ndash; like to think of ourselves as accepting, loving people who don&rsquo;t wash after we shake hands with the poor (You may bump elbows with them at the lav &ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t that be something!). We would all like to congratulate ourselves on our holy enlightenment by giving away our Abercrombie to the homeless as if that&rsquo;s not insulting to them (I digress). But reaching around to pat ourselves on the back makes us too busy to notice our sin. And too full of pride to admit and confess it, turn from it in repentance, and become a debtor to grace. That is the sad condition in which those who practice a philosophy of tolerance find themselves. And, Christian, that is the sad condition some of us find ourselves in. No pointing fingers and saying, &ldquo;Ah-ha!&rdquo; unless you&rsquo;re standing in front of the mirror.</p>\n\n<p>So if I were face to face with Adam I might pat his back and tell him how sorry I am that his philosophy has been proven false and that he has been unable to carry it out and that his idols have feet of clay. I would welcome him to the human race and say that we&rsquo;re all in this together and we&rsquo;re all in need of a Savior. I would agree that it&rsquo;s almost intolerable in its weight, but true none the less. And I would assure him that I&rsquo;m still a fan.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>There are many ways to preach a sermon.&nbsp; No doubt, some are more effective than others.&nbsp;Some people preach thematically, some topically, some do series, and some preach verse by verse through books of the Bible.&nbsp; Each can be effective, but surely some ways are better than others.&nbsp; By the name of our ministry, you can probably guess which method of preaching we prefer.&nbsp;Personally, I think it&rsquo;s the best method of preaching.&nbsp; But would you say it is &ldquo;cheating&rdquo;?</p>\n\n<p>Well, the senior pastor of a mega church thinks that preaching verse by verse through books of the Bible is cheating.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Stanley\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Stanley</a> is the pastor of <a href=\"http://northpoint.org/\" target=\"_blank\">North Point Community Church</a> in Alpharetta, GA (just outside Atlanta).&nbsp;At just over 30,000 members, this is the second largest church in America.&nbsp; In a <a href=\"http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2009/march/andy-stanley-on-communication-part-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">2009 interview</a>, pastor Stanley was asked this question:&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you think about preaching verse-by-verse messages through books of the Bible?&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was his response:</p>\n\n<pre>\n&#10;<em>Guys that preach verse-by-verse through books of the Bible-- that is just cheating.&#10;It&#39;s cheating because that would be easy, first of all. That isn&#39;t how you grow people.&#10;No one in the Scripture modeled that.  There&#39;s not one example of that.  All Scripture&#10;is equally inspired, but not all Scripture is equally applicable or relevant to every &#10;stage of life. My challenge is to read culture and to read an audience and ask: What &#10;is the felt need?  Or perhaps what is more important, what is an unfelt need they need&#10;to feel that I can address? Because if they don&#39;t feel it, then they won&#39;t address it.&#10;</em></pre>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">When I read this, I really didn&rsquo;t understand what he meant by &ldquo;cheating&rdquo;.&nbsp;He says it&rsquo;s easy, but just because something is easy does not mean it is cheating.&nbsp;To cheat means to deceive, defraud, violate rules, to act dishonestly.&nbsp;I cannot see how preaching verse by verse &ldquo;cheats&rdquo; in any way whatsoever.&nbsp;Scripture does not say preaching has to be verse by verse, but it also does not say one cannot preach that way.&nbsp;So, to say it is cheating is simply nonsensical.</span></p>\n\n<p>He also says that preaching verse by verse is &ldquo;easy&rdquo;.&nbsp;Clearly, pastor Stanley has never preached verse by verse.&nbsp;It may be many things, but it is not easy, at least not if it&rsquo;s done right.&nbsp;Preaching through a book of the Bible requires a historical understanding of the book being preached.&nbsp;It requires an understanding of the underlying Hebrew or Greek.&nbsp;It requires cross referencing to other Scriptures.&nbsp;It requires studying Biblical commentaries, which aren&rsquo;t absolutely necessary, but are certainly very helpful.&nbsp; No, this is not easy.&nbsp;On the contrary, it is hard work.</p>\n\n<p>He next says that verse by verse preaching does not grow people.&nbsp;Before examining this, it&rsquo;s helpful to know what pastor Stanley thinks does grow people.&nbsp;He relates a defining moment in his life:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<pre>\n<em>I believe the true defining moment of my life as a communicator took place when&#10;I was in seminary. I was asked to do a chapel for the high school academy at &#10;First Baptist Church, Dallas. So I got the message all ready to go, and I was &#10;going to preach on the story of Naaman. And God told him to dip in the water &#10;seven times and he would be healed. I had all this great stuff. And I was sitting &#10;in my one-room efficiency apartment and I was thinking, \"These kids have heard &#10;everything. They go to church all the time. They are not going to remember this. &#10;This is just another chapel. What can I do so that they can remember this? I am &#10;just going to come up with one phrase and I am going to say it so many times that &#10;they can&#39;t possibility forget it.  So I came up with this phrase: \"To understand &#10;why, submit and apply.\" That was over 30 years ago and I still remember it.  &#10;So I told the whole story. And I said the bottom line was: \"To understand why, &#10;submit and apply.\" And I said that God is going to ask you to do some things &#10;that you might not understand why, but you must submit and apply. I had them say &#10;it over and over. Three years go by, and I am working in the college department &#10;in the same church and a freshman walks in and says, \"I remember you. To understand &#10;why, submit and apply.\" He didn&#39;t remember my name. He wasn&#39;t even sure where &#10;he had seen me before. But it stuck in his head. And I&#39;ll never forget thinking, &#10;\"That is what I want to do for the rest of my life. I want to take all this stuff &#10;in the Bible, and I want to say it so simply that it gets so lodged in people&#39;s &#10;hearts that in the moment of transition or temptation or whatever it might be, &#10;they think: What is that statement? What is that phrase?</em></pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the positive side, it&rsquo;s good he wants to take what&rsquo;s in the Bible and get it lodged into people&rsquo;s hearts.&nbsp;While using a catch phrase can be helpful, I think he turns preaching on its head.&nbsp; Rather than preach the word and let it do its work by the power of the Spirit, he thinks in his own power (by using catch phrases and appealing to felt needs), he can grow people.&nbsp;That is not what Scripture says.&nbsp;In John 17, in His high priestly prayer to the Father, Jesus prays for His disciples&rsquo; sanctification:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;<em>13 But now I come to You; and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves. 14 I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 15 I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one. 16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 17 Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth. 18 As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. 19 For their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth</em>.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Jesus explicitly says we will be sanctified in His word.&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t need catchy phrases, appeals to felt needs or an engaging environment in which we hear the word.&nbsp;The word does its work in us by the power of the Spirit.&nbsp;Martin Luther stated this very well:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<pre>\n&#10;<em>&ldquo;In short, I will preach it, teach it, write it, but I will constrain no man &#10;by force, for faith must come freely without compulsion. <span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Take myself as an example.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> &#10;I opposed indulgences and all the papists, but never with force.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> I simply taught, &#10;preached, and wrote God&rsquo;s Word; otherwise I did nothing. </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And while I slept &#10;[cf. Mark 4:26&ndash;29], or drank Wittenberg beer with my friends Philipp&#65279;&#65279; and Amsdorf,&#65279;&#65279; &#10;the Word so greatly weakened the papacy that no prince or emperor ever inflicted &#10;such losses upon it. I did nothing; the Word did everything.&rdquo;  </span></em></pre>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It was the word of God that moved people out of the darkness of the false gospel of Catholicism; Luther simply preached it.</span></p>\n\n<p>Luther referred to Mark 4, which says,</p>\n\n<h5><br />\n&ldquo;<em>26 And He was saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is like a man who casts seed upon the soil; 27 and he goes to bed at night and gets up by day, and the seed sprouts and grows&mdash;how, he himself does not know. 28 The soil produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the head, then the mature grain in the head. 29 But when the crop permits, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThe seed is the word, and all we need do is preach it.&nbsp; The Lord Himself will provide the growth.&nbsp; As we read in 1 Corinthians 3: &nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;<em>6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. 7 So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth</em>.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Paul tells pastor Timothy to preach the word:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;<em>1 I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: 2 preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction. 3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, 4 and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths. 5 But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry</em>.&rdquo; (2 Timothy 4)<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Beloved, if pastors are appealing to &ldquo;felt needs&rdquo;, they are going to draw people to themselves who want their ears tickled.&nbsp; They will seek out those pastors who preach in accordance with their own desires.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, perhaps pastor Stanley&rsquo;s worst statement is this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<pre>\n&#10;<em>&ldquo;All Scripture is equally inspired, but not all Scripture is equally &#10;applicable or relevant to every stage of life. My challenge is to read &#10;culture and to read an audience and ask: What is the felt need? Or &#10;perhaps what is more important, what is an unfelt need they need to &#10;feel that I can address?  Because if they don&#39;t feel it, then they &#10;won&#39;t address it.&rdquo;&#10;</em>&#8203;</pre>\n\n<p>Do you see the pride at work here?&nbsp;This man thinks he knows when Scripture is relevant and when it isn&rsquo;t in each life of all of his 30,000 plus congregation.&nbsp;Seriously?&nbsp;No one but God knows what each person needs to hear.&nbsp;Indeed, 2 Timothy 3 contradicts the pastor&rsquo;s statement:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">6 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17 so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">.&rdquo;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The Bible explicitly says <strong><em>all</em></strong> Scripture is profitable, which means it is <strong><em>always</em></strong> profitable.&nbsp;It is <em><strong>always</strong></em> relevant.&nbsp;How can any pastor think they somehow know that some passages of Scripture are and are not relevant to certain stages of life?&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n<p>This brings us back to the beauty of preaching verse by verse through books of the Bible.&nbsp; When this is done, the pastor doesn&rsquo;t need to try to address felt or unfelt needs.&nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about in what stage of life a person is.&nbsp;He doesn&rsquo;t need to worry about the culture, or &ldquo;reading an audience&rdquo;.&nbsp; Paul certainly didn&rsquo;t worry about reading his audience (Acts 20):<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;<em>7 On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight. 8 There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together. 9 And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead. 10 But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said, &ldquo;Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.&rdquo; 11 When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left. 12 They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted</em>.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Talk about &ldquo;felt needs&rdquo; &ndash; people were falling asleep and even dying!&nbsp; What did Paul do?&nbsp;Healed the boy and kept on preaching!&nbsp;Paul knew that what we all really need is to hear the word of God, which is profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness.&nbsp;This is how we are sanctified and equipped for every good work.</p>\n\n<p>While it&rsquo;s not an absolute, generally speaking, the size of a church tends to be inversely related to how much or how deeply the word is preached.&nbsp; This is exactly as God predicted, as people seek out preaching where they can be comfortable (see 2 Timothy 4 above).&nbsp; Indeed, the church I attend preaches verse by verse, and we are very small.&nbsp; As for us, we will continue to preach verse by verse, spreading the seed of the word.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go to sleep, wake up and watch how God the Holy Spirit brings that seed to full maturity, all to His glory.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll also look joyfully towards His harvest.&nbsp; Even so, come Lord Jesus!</p>"

It hit me like a semi truck. It hit me like when those poor basketball players would run into Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal down in the post, and fall flat on their backs.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Let us tear [the fetters of God and His Anointed Jesus] apart<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And cast away their cords from us!&rdquo;</span></strong></em></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In other words, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get rid of God.&rdquo;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The human race has been about the business of &ldquo;getting rid of God&rdquo; for several decades now. Of course, scripture tells us that man&rsquo;s natural inclination is to get rid of God, period. Remember Adam and Eve in the garden? What I mean is getting rid of Him in a very unapologetic, very public way. It is the litany of &lsquo;no&rsquo;: no cross, no Bible, no prayer, no displaying of commandments, no mention of creation in textbook, no such thing as hell, no Bible-based counseling from the chaplain, no moral absolutes, no absolute truth, no boundaries in genetic perversions of His creation, no God-given definition of marriage, no God-established definition of life&hellip; and so on.</span></p>\n\n<p>Psalm 2 speaks specifically of an agenda by the rulers, taking counsel together against the Lord. It speaks about a concerted effort to tear off anything that binds us to God, for that is what fetters are. With each decree, treaty, official action and decision they lead their nations ever farther off the course of reconciliation with God. As believers, our eyes widen, our hearts sink, and (I hope) we instantly recognize these as signs of the closing of the age.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know if it is true, but I&rsquo;ve read that dogs are not aware of their own size. Have you ever seen a tiny dog square off against a really big dog? It is ridiculous and hilarious, until the big dog barks back. (v.4-5) He who sits in heaven is looking down at us little ants running around scheming and shaking our fists at the One we claim probably doesn&#39;t even exist &mdash;and He laughs. At first He laughs, but then He will speak in anger to remind us that He has appointed His Son Jesus as King upon His holy mountain (v.5). Forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Brothers and sisters in Christ, take comfort in the promises God has made to His Son Jesus (vv. 7-9), and through Him to us, His co-heirs in the Kingdom (Rom. 8:17). When you see the rulers of the earth take counsel together against the Lord, step back and see them for what they are: a tiny little dog who doesn&rsquo;t realize the power of the One against whom they have declared their enmity.</p>\n\n<p>Verses 10-12 are such a clear warning. It makes you want to copy-paste it onto an email out to all those fools (Ps. 14.1). If only they would read it. If only they had the Spirit to understand it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Now therefore, O kings</strong></em> [presidents, prime-ministers, governors, sheiks..]<em><strong>, show discernment;</strong></em><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><em><strong>Take warning, O judges</strong></em> [leaders, congress, parliament, city-councils, mayors, court judges] <em><strong>of the earth.</strong></em></span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><em><strong>&ldquo;Worship the Lord with reverence and rejoice with trembling.&rdquo;</strong></em> (v.11)</span></p>\n\n<p>Worship Him and rejoice, and then tremble in fear and gratitude that you are still alive and the big dog didn&rsquo;t maul you to death right there where you stood barking your little bark. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As for me, this little dog will hide behind her Master, her Protector:</span></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>&ldquo;How blessed are all who take refuge in Him!&rdquo;</strong></em> (v.12)</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make the same mistake of the rulers. My fetters, I want them nice and tight. I like them locked, and the key thrown away. You see, what I know that they don&rsquo;t is that I used to be bound by a different set of fetters that chained me to sin, and to the cursed earth that will soon be destroyed. But God traded those in for me and bound me to Himself, because it&rsquo;s the only way to keep me safe.</p>\n\n<p>The hymn writer said it best:</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, bind my wandering heart to Thee.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love.<br />\nHere&rsquo;s my heart, Lord, take and seal it. Seal it for Thy courts above.&rdquo;</span></em></p>"

                 "body": "<p>I have my grandmother&rsquo;s arms. I&rsquo;m not especially pleased about this development. You see, my grandmother was on the&hellip;plump side, and her arms were&hellip;plump&hellip;and flabby and cool. Now they&rsquo;re mine. This morning my husband and I were leaning side by side against the kitchen counter and he reached around me, put his hand against the flabby back of my arm, and sighed. My son does this on occasion as well. They both just seem compelled to touch my arms. I know. It&rsquo;s weird. But I get it.</p>\n\n<p>My grandmother was not an affectionate woman. She had little time for it between cooking three huge meals every day of her life, raising six children (and some of their children), quilting, cleaning, working a 2-acre &ldquo;garden&rdquo;, canning, juicing, jellying, plucking chickens, milking cows and all the stuff with which we modern women thankfully have no experience. But sometimes she would sit down in her fancy red velvet rocker and would invite me into her lap. On those rare occasions, I would rest my head on those cool flabby arms and find comfort and peace and security.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been attending my church&rsquo;s Saturday evening service lately. It has a completely separate identity and personality from the Sunday service. The congregation calls itself &ldquo;Mosaic&rdquo; and their principle is, &ldquo;All are broken. All are welcome. One gets the glory.&rdquo; I like it there. It has the feel of my grandmother&rsquo;s arms. Mosaic is true to Paul&rsquo;s words in 1st Timothy 1:15-17, &ldquo;<em>Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>We all have stuff we don&rsquo;t like about ourselves, like flabby arms, and we do what we can to cover those things when we&rsquo;re in public. You won&rsquo;t likely ever see me wearing a sleeveless shirt. (In fact, I often wonder why all shirtsleeves don&rsquo;t end at the elbow!) But at some point we have to accept that this is the genetic hand we&rsquo;ve been dealt, and no matter how hard we work those triceps, we&rsquo;re just gonna have flabby arms. Doesn&rsquo;t mean we stop working. Doesn&rsquo;t mean we stop wearing longer sleeves. Just means that we know there are limitations to the outcome of our efforts to reverse or hide&nbsp;our condition.</p>\n\n<p>In the Church, we are especially bad about pretending that we don&rsquo;t suffer the effects of our DNA. We dress our best when we gather with other believers as if the right clothes, shoes, tie or smile will disguise the fact that we all share the same genetic code: We are sinners. We were born this way. And while your direction of warp may be different from mine, we all have one. I fight the sin of gluttony. Maybe you battle the temptation to gossip. Or you&rsquo;re addicted to prescription drugs. Or you are lustfully tempted by your secretary. Who knows? No one, unless we occasionally roll up our sleeves and let people see the areas we are struggling with, working on, and keeping under wraps - the areas that respond only minimally to self-effort and ultimately have only one solution -&nbsp;Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>There are consequences when we refuse to expose our battles against the flesh. Hiding our weaknesses perpetuates the lie that everyone &#39;else&#39; is OK, and it&nbsp;gags those who are screaming for release from their self-imposed cover-up. It prolongs denial, comparison, envy, pride, fear, inferiority, disappointment, and isolation. It delays truth, identification, good-will, humility, courage, security, encouragement, and community. (The devil loves it!)&nbsp; In our pretense, we become an obstruction to God&rsquo;s work in the unsaved, and we steal His glory. Look at Paul&rsquo;s conclusion again in slow motion.</p>\n\n<p>I was shown mercy. <em><strong>So that. In me. The. Worst. Of. Sinners.</strong></em> Christ Jesus might display His immense patience.<em><strong> As. An. Example. For.</strong></em> Those who would believe in Him and receive eternal life. Glory.</p>\n\n<p>How can anyone see the immense patience of God unless they first know just how much patience I require&hellip;and receive? How will anyone know that He is Healer unless I expose my scars? How will anyone believe that they can experience His boundless love unless I first admit to all the ways that I am an undeserving recipient of it? How will anyone come to trust His sufficiency unless I admit to my weaknesses?</p>\n\n<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not a fan of moping around in our brokenness - I&rsquo;ve already said that we should choose the sleeves that cover the most shame when we&rsquo;re in public - but if I meet you at church and I notice that we share a weakness, I&rsquo;m liable to bare mine to you. Not because I&rsquo;m proud of it, but so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His immense patience as an example for you who would believe in Him and be saved. In that way, then, the thing I dislike the most about myself can be redeemed. Then that ugly place in my life becomes a place where you may find a soft cool place to lay your head and find comfort and peace and security. Like my grandmother&rsquo;s arms. Glory. To. God.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>According to my back-of-the-envelope&nbsp;math, the&nbsp;average Christian spends about 1% of waking hours each year in church services (assuming weekly attendance). Throw in a&nbsp;few weekday&nbsp;church events here and there and maybe a mission trip during&nbsp;the summer, and the average Christian still spends less than 5% of each year engaged in formal&nbsp;Christian&nbsp;activities and gatherings. (I suspect for many of us, the actual number is even smaller.)</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the vast majority of our time is spent in the necessary and predictable activities of everyday life. The <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/\" target=\"_blank\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> collects data on an American&#39;s&nbsp;average work day, and their findings are unsurprising:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/chart1.jpg\" style=\"max-width: 99%;  border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>What I find striking about this chart (apart from the fact that most people seem to get&nbsp;FAR more sleep than I do), is how much time we spend with other people during an average day. According to this estimate, we spend 37% of our time in work-related activities, another 11% in leisure activities&nbsp;and nearly 10% of our day eat, drinking and caring for others. Assuming we aren&#39;t doing these activities alone, the average person spends nearly 60% of every day in the company of other people &ndash; <em>and many of these people do not know Christ</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This fact raises an important question: are we putting that time&nbsp;to good use by serving as an ambassador for&nbsp;Christ? Do we practice our Christian lifestyle 24/7 or only in the presence of other Christians at church or in a home group?&nbsp;Are we \"off-duty\" during the 60% of each day we&#39;re rubbing elbows with the world?&nbsp;If so, then we&#39;re missing our best opportuity to be a witness for the Gospel.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m fond of saying that ministry is what we do between mission trips. That&#39;s my way of pointing out that while Christians will get pumped up at the chance to spread the gospel in some far away, exotic location during one week of the summer, most never witness about Christ to the people they&nbsp;see every day. Obviously, mission trips are important, but they aren&#39;t the only (or even best) way for us&nbsp;to step out as witnesses for Christ.</p>\n\n<p>An effective Christian witness begins at home, and it only requires three things: <strong>knowledge</strong>, <strong>relationship</strong>, and <strong>persistence</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>First, we must be knowledgeable of the Gospel, which means knowing WHO and WHAT we are called to represent. Peter says it plainly:</p>\n\n<h6>1Pet. 3:15 &nbsp;but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Have you&nbsp;ever spent time&nbsp;preparing for a one-week mission trip (e.g.,&nbsp;learning the culture, practicing an evangelism&nbsp;speech, roleplaying with fellow Christians,&nbsp;praying for a harvest, etc.)? Then you understand how important knowledge and preparation are to the success of your mission. Why prepare any less before&nbsp;talking&nbsp;to&nbsp;your nextdoor neighbor or a coworker about Christ?</p>\n\n<p>We must spend time becoming knowledgeable of Christ and the Gospel&nbsp;before we can be an everyday witness&nbsp;to that&nbsp;truth. A teacher can&#39;t teach others until he/she knows the material first, so a witness for Christ must sanctify Christ in his/her heart and&nbsp;understand the depths of God&#39;s word before tackling the difficult questions unbelievers&nbsp;ask.</p>\n\n<p>Prepare everyday for a mission experience at home.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Study your&nbsp;Bible until you can explain and&nbsp;defend the Gospel with ease. Be purposeful in your studies, knowing that the days are short and opportunities are fleeting, so we must make the most of every encounter. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we need to establish relationships&nbsp;before we pounce with&nbsp;a call to repent.&nbsp;People know the difference between a&nbsp;sincere appeal and cynical sales pitch, so effective ministry depends on personal relationships<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">. Paul often spent many months living around the people he hoped to influence, because it made his ministry more effective.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Concerning his own ministry, Paul said:</span></p>\n\n<h6>2Cor. 5:11 &nbsp;Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Paul understood the arrival of saving faith relies entirely upon the work of the Holy Spirit, nevertheless he says he worked to&nbsp;<em>pursuade</em>&nbsp;men to the truth of the Gospel, while hoping&nbsp;the Lord would make his sincerity and honesty <em>manifest</em> to them. Simply put, Paul&#39;s appeal to the citizens of Corinth was personal. He spent time with them. He loved them, and he spoke from the heart, delivering the truth&nbsp;in a persuasive manner &ndash; yet&nbsp;depending on God to make his message hit home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Make it personal. Get to know the people you want to persuade, and relate to them in a sincere way. We have to&nbsp;care&nbsp;about the people we hope to reach.&nbsp;If we see witnessing as a special effort we undertake on rare occasions, then we&#39;re likely to never see much success. Make friends, and you&#39;ll find&nbsp;countless opportunites to represent Christ during the&nbsp;60% of your day spent in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, we must be persistent in our effort, but persistence doesn&#39;t mean being pushy or overbearing. Persistence in this context means remaining \"on-duty\" at all times. Jesus taught:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 5:14 &nbsp;&ldquo;You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:15&nbsp; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:16 &ldquo;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may&nbsp; see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Not every encounter in our day will lead somewhere, but we should live as if every encounter has that potential.&nbsp;Do you desire salvation for&nbsp;the neighbor or coworker you see daily every bit&nbsp;as much&nbsp;as for the orphan in Africa or the shopkeeper in Mexico you meet only once? If so, then remain persistently \"on-duty\" as you spend time with these people.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The pattern is simple but powerful. Know your Bible. Make friends.&nbsp;Take&nbsp;every opportunity to testify to the grace of Christ.&nbsp;Live with purpose&nbsp;everyday, and appeal to&nbsp;the Lord to manifest your sincerity to unbelievers. When you live this way, you&#39;re likely to see&nbsp;hearts changed when you least expect it. This&nbsp;is the essence of what Jesus meant in Matthew 5:14-16...b</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">eing an accidental witness.</span></p>"

As I have mentioned before, EVERYTHING in the Bible is there for a reason. People would have figured out the mystery long ago if they had bothered to learn Hebrew. In Hebrew, every letter has a number attached to it. The Hebrews used their alphabet as a numbering system. The numbers attached to the letters in a Hebrew word could be added together to give a numerical total. The number 153 is the numerical total for the Hebrew words \"Ani Elohim\"--I AM G-D. When Jesus caused the disciples to catch exactly 153 fish, He was declaring to them that not only was He the Son of G-d, but that He was God Himself. Tell your Muslim friends who say that Jesus never claimed to be G-d that yes, He most certainly did!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The text came with an accompanying graphic showing the calculation of <em>ani elohim</em> totaling 153 similar to this:</p>\n\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(34, 34, 34);

I am not aware of <em><strong>any</strong> </em>Scriptural examples of Hebrew letters <em>literally</em> equating to a numeric value. That concept only exists in <strong>gematria</strong> where the \"hidden\" meanings of words are calculated by means of <em>assigning</em> a value to each letter of a word. It definitely doesn&#39;t work in reverse where you are given a number and find some words that match up with it via gematria. Google \"gematria\" and get an eye full of the origins of <em>that</em> concept. Yikes!</p>\n\n<p>Scripture <strong>is</strong> full of examples where numbers symbolize concepts:</p>\n\n<p>Two symbolizes testimony (\"I call heaven and earth to witness against you\")</p>\n\n<p>Four symbolizes judgment (the four horns of the altar)</p>\n\n<p>Six symbolizes flawed humanity (666 in Revelation)</p>\n\n<p>Seven symbolizes completion (the seven days of Creation), etc</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But this is <em>Scripture</em> connecting a numeric value with an idea.

                 "body": "<p>~~Does your local Christian radio station do these random acts of kindness days where you pay for the guy behind you in the drive-through and then you call in to tell about it?? Yeah. I hate those things. Is there anything less random than that? Is there anything more boastful? &ldquo;Hello. Yes, I just did a really nice thing for the people in the car behind me. Aren&rsquo;t I special? Please praise my generosity on your radio broadcast.&rdquo; One blogger and best-selling author that I (used to) follow, quietly bought dinner in her local restaurant for a huge family, then shot a selfie showing them at the table behind her and posted it on Facebook. Ugh. We really do this. (And why we do not call this out for the sin it is, is beyond me!)</p>\n\n<p>This is one of those posts I have debated for days. To write or not to write, that has been the question. I&rsquo;ve sung this song before, first verse, second verse, and chorus. But it&rsquo;s an issue that continues to perplex me, and because the song is on a continuous loop in my head, it&rsquo;s one that I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not seeing clearly. You let me know.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to confuse the issue even more by trying to grab hold of those wisps of thoughts that just brush across your mind like a hair across your face, tickling and unspecific, but irksome anyway in their connectedness. Can you bear with me while I try to catch the strands and make sense of them?</p>\n\n<p>First, I&rsquo;m in the middle of a short but intensive look at the Tabernacle. You know, the worship center the Israelites carried on their backs for 40 years in the desert? What struck me most in my study yesterday was something Pastor Armstrong says in the second part of his Tabernacle teaching from Exodus 27/28. I&rsquo;ll put it in my own less-eloquent words. It was ugly on the outside. Or at least it was very plain. But the <em><strong>inside</strong></em>! Whoa! The inside was nothing less than resplendent as far as tents go. Pastor Armstrong reminded us that this is a shadow of our Savior (as is the whole Tabernacle). It made me wonder as I tried to apply those two truths to a New Testament lesson if maybe on the outside we should be plain, but on the inside, we should be <em><strong>stunning</strong></em>! And I&rsquo;m not talking biology. Nothing we can do with that hand if we&rsquo;re dealt the ugly card. I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;the show&rdquo;; the performance we put on for man, forgetting entirely about the one that God is watching.</p>\n\n<p>So there&rsquo;s that whole thing. Then there&rsquo;s this. There is a new movement among young Christian women right now that I call (with all due respect, as I cautiously watch from a distance!) the movement of discontent. Here is a quote from an attendee at their latest national gathering: <em>\"I hear enough people telling me how to be a good Christian mom. I don&#39;t need that,\" \"This is a call for revival and unity, and it lined up with what&#39;s in my heart right now.\"(</em>Huffington) I wonder then if she&rsquo;s as good a &ldquo;Christian mom&rdquo; as she can be? I wonder if what&rsquo;s in her heart aligns with God&rsquo;s heart? I wonder if she has forsaken her ministry at home for a &ldquo;spiritual calling&rdquo; that&rsquo;s just a tad more glamourous and exciting than the one that she is already in the midst of. And I&rsquo;m wondering if the leaders of this movement aren&rsquo;t fanning the flames of her discontent? I&rsquo;m just wondering.</p>\n\n<p>Last night a friend copied me a link that she &ldquo;knew would get me riled up&rdquo;. (Gotta love friends that will poke the bear with a stick.) One of the local mega-churches is hosting the tour of a speaker who has gained international attention in recent years for his breakout book on radical service (naming no names!). The marketing material calls this a gathering that &ldquo;<em>challenges you to leverage your life in a way that counts for the kingdom</em>.&rdquo; And claims a &ldquo;<em>God-sized vision</em>&rdquo; that &ldquo;<em>awakens and empowers you to know that your life on mission matters</em>.&rdquo; My life <em><strong>on mission </strong></em>matters. My life <em><strong>on mission </strong></em>counts for the kingdom. Apparently, I&rsquo;ve been asleep all this time and powerless to do anything worthwhile. Maybe that&rsquo;s carrying it a bit too far, but I&rsquo;m really thinking not (having read the book).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a bit closer to home, I&rsquo;m reminded of a friend who left her church recently because she felt that the work she was doing for them was going unappreciated. She admittedly misses her church family there, but refuses to go back. She won&rsquo;t call that pride. She won&rsquo;t call it sin. She just keeps looking for a church that will give her props.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You know what? I know that we&rsquo;re supposed to do good things. I know James says that faith without works is no faith at all. I know that. I get that. But I also know a barrage of other scripture too like when Jesus says, <em>&ldquo;Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.&rdquo;</em> (Matthew 6:1-4) I&rsquo;m guessing that eliminates radio broadcasts too.</p>\n\n<p>I also remember Paul writing about the difference between trying to please man and God (in serving the Gospel) and about working with integrity <em><strong>when no one is watching</strong></em>, knowing that we work for God and not for man.</p>\n\n<p>I remember too that Paul tells Timothy to teach &ldquo;sound doctrine&rdquo; (this one is gonna really get your hackles up), and goes on to say that sound doctrine includes teaching &ldquo;&hellip;<em>the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.</em>&rdquo; (Titus 2) I guess you could call this being a good &ldquo;Christian mom&rdquo;, and I don&rsquo;t know about any of you, but I&rsquo;m not there yet!!!</p>\n\n<p>And I guess therein is my complaint. Why is somewhere <em><strong>else</strong></em> so much better than <em><strong>here</strong></em>? Why doesn&rsquo;t my mission at home count for the kingdom? If I focus on quietly serving my family and community, does that mean I haven&rsquo;t leveraged my life effectively? If I am about my Father&rsquo;s work of learning &ndash; <em><strong>struggling </strong></em>&ndash; to be obedient to His word at home, will I find a community out there that lines up with <em><strong>my</strong></em> heart? Not today, I won&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re all too busy looking for their own &ldquo;God-sized&rdquo; vision and convincing the rest of us that we don&rsquo;t matter unless we get on board and start punching our card! Or they&rsquo;re waiting on hold for the radio host to answer their call so they can trumpet their good-deeding for the day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my response. GO! Be on mission somewhere else! Take others with you and post it on social media! But don&rsquo;t forget that we already have callings on our lives, and they are our first priority. We already have one Master, and He is our first stop for affirmation. Anyone can get on a plane and fly to Guatemala for a week of rocking babies in orphanages. Not everyone can do the work of serving God faithfully, obediently, day in and day out in quiet obscurity. <em><strong>That</strong></em>, my friends, is a God-sized mission the likes of which we rarely see (um&hellip;because it&rsquo;s done in quiet obscurity mostly).</p>\n\n<p>God has not called all of us to what<em><strong> the world </strong></em>would&nbsp;characterize as&nbsp;a &ldquo;God-sized&rdquo; mission, even though the work of sanctification couldn&rsquo;t be called anything less. Even though raising the next generation of faithful men and women is tantamount to a miracle. Even though remaining in a committed marriage is an aberration even in the church. Even though integrity in the workplace is surprising. Even though the level of Biblical literacy in our churches is embarrassingly shallow and misinformed. Even though the evidence of&nbsp;unrepentant sin is on display in our ever-expanding waistbands. Even though all that&hellip;we don&rsquo;t call that work a God-sized mission that leverages our life for the kingdom. That work, apparently is the slumber from which we should awaken.</p>\n\n<p>Some are asking, essentially, what if God is real? (Um&hellip; &ldquo;if&rdquo;?!) Then what? Well, then He expects us to start doing what He told us to do where we are with what we have, not to be looking somewhere else for something better.(Who do you think put you where you are, anyway?) Maybe I have a cynical view of the Body of Christ (nahhhhhh&hellip;.) but in my limited experience, the average pew-sitter knows so very little of what God wants from them every day. There is zero accountability for sin. Shoot. In my experience, most believers aren&rsquo;t even aware of their own sins enough to name them. We advertise our good works all day long on every forum of social media available to us&hellip;yes, we know what garners praise&hellip;but we don&rsquo;t really want to be reminded that we didn&rsquo;t need to be in that drive-through lane to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m digressing. I guess what it all boils down to for me is this. We need to clean up our own yard before we move on to our neighbors&rsquo;. What good are we doing in Guatemala rocking babies, when our own teenager is at home hanging himself in his closet? Are you really done hearing about how to be a good &ldquo;Christian mom&rdquo;? A good wife. A good friend. A good employee, citizen, church-member, tax payer, volunteer. Have you got all that figured out, checked the box, and booked a flight to elsewhere? If you have, well, good for you. But could you go <em><strong>quietly</strong></em> about your business and let the rest of us get there in our own time&hellip;in God&rsquo;s time&hellip;without you breathing down our necks and good-deeding us to nausea on our local Christian radio station while we&rsquo;re driving carpool? We&rsquo;re trying to do this thing. Same as you. Only quieter.</p>\n\n<p>I really got worked up there at the end. I hope I haven&rsquo;t offended. But I am unapologetic if it opens a dialogue between you and God about what counts for the kingdom. It&rsquo;s His kingdom, you know, not ours. Maybe it&rsquo;s time for us to sit down with His book instead of everyone else&rsquo;s and let Him tell us what He thinks we need to be doing and then get to work quietly doing that. There won&rsquo;t be trumpets, confetti, or a parade at the end, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that our effort will please the One who matters even if&nbsp;we can&rsquo;t write a book about it later.</p>"

Will Tribulation? Hardship? Persecution? Hunger? Poverty? Danger? War? </strong><br />\nAs the <em>Tanakh </em>[the Hebrew name of the Old Testament] puts it: For your sake we are being put to death all day long, we are considered sheep to be slaughtered. [Psalm 44:22]</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;\">No, in all of these things we <strong>are </strong>[present tense] completely victorious through the One who has loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor other heavenly rulers, neither what exists <em><strong>nor what is coming</strong></em>, neither powers above nor powers below, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of G-d which comes to us through the Messiah <em>Yeshua</em>, our Master.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That brilliant Jewish scholar was the man we know as Paul and the words above are from Romans chapter 8:31-39. In any and every circumstance where we find ourselves we should know that we <strong>are </strong>victorious in Messiah! Although we might not see the evidence of that victory at this exact moment, G-d sees all things and has declared it to be true and I take Him at His Word.</p>\n\n<p>Every Sabbath day, the people of Israel recite certain passages of Scripture to remind themselves of G-d&#39;s promises towards them:</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;\">Do not fear sudden terror, or the holocaust of the wicked when it comes. [Proverbs 3:25] Plan a conspiracy and it will be annulled; speak your piece and it shall not stand, for G-d is with us.

                 "body": "<p>~~This is a conversation I can&rsquo;t have in my very Republican, very conservative household. I wonder&hellip;can I have it here? Are you open-minded? Can we ask some questions, agree to pray and think and reason together without political borders limiting our Christian practice? I wonder. Here goes.</p>\n\n<p>A bit of background. I live in Springdale, Arkansas. If you check the Wiki page for our fair city, you will learn that 35% of our population is Hispanic, and 22% are &ldquo;Pacific Islanders&rdquo;. (Read up a bit on the tragic story of the Marshall Islands and how the US Government &ldquo;compensated&rdquo; the Island natives and you will understand. Nationwide, we have the largest population of that displaced people living among us thanks to some anthropological study done by the University of Arkansas some years ago.) I say all that so that you will understand that this topic is something I live with. It is next door to me. It is in my son&rsquo;s school. It is in my grocery store, my help-wanted ads, my doctor&rsquo;s office, my home. It is the life-breath of my small community. It is not some far-flung problem for someone &ldquo;else&rdquo;. It is not something I&rsquo;ve made judgments about from a distance. It is an on-going conversation in my soul about people &ndash; real people &ndash; that I live with every day. It&rsquo;s personal.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nA friend of mine posted something today on Facebook that troubled me. This is someone I respect immensely both as a human being, and as a Christian. A pillar of faith. The post was essentially recognizing the hypocrisy and injustice of a government that provides illegal immigrants with health insurance that is paid for by legal citizens. This is a weighty and complicated matter, but at its root, I believe, is that very American &ldquo;give-me-liberty-or-give-me-death&rdquo; mentality. We simply don&rsquo;t want to be<em><strong> forced </strong></em>to do anything. I&rsquo;m offering no solutions here to the political problem, and if you&rsquo;re looking for a debate, you won&rsquo;t get one from me. I&rsquo;m firmly straddling the fence looking both directions. However&hellip; when I have my Christian glasses on, I tend to see things very differently from when I&rsquo;m looking through my &ldquo;American&rdquo;, &ldquo;First-World&rdquo;, &ldquo;entitled&rdquo;, &ldquo;white Anglo- Saxon&rdquo; glasses. That tends to be the default view in these conversations. The whole issue rests on principle &ndash; you know, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the principle of the thing&rdquo;. But we still see those principles through American, first-world, entitled, Anglo-Saxon glasses.</p>\n\n<p>So this morning, I took off the glasses that make me feel indignant and self-righteous when I think of this problem, and I thought about Jesus. I&rsquo;m asking myself some questions. I&rsquo;m asking myself if Jesus cares about the physical (IMAGINARY) boarders between countries that represent nothing more than human conquest, or if he cares about the people on either side of the line. I&rsquo;m asking if he cares about &ldquo;principle&rdquo; or if he cares about who dies because we stand so firmly entrenched on it that we stop seeing people! I&rsquo;m asking myself a lot of things.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s one. I wonder, when the thief on the cross came to heaven&rsquo;s gate if God asked him how he got there? Did he tell the man that he hadn&rsquo;t come through the proper channels? I mean, he never attended church, never tithed, and for heaven&rsquo;s sake, he couldn&rsquo;t even speak the language (that blessing is his for sure!), how could he possibly expect to benefit from the blessings of heaven? I mean, it&rsquo;s the principle of the thing!</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if giving insurance (or public education, or honest work, or food and housing assistance) to &ldquo;illegal aliens&rdquo; is what Jesus had in mind when he encouraged us to walk the extra mile, turn the other cheek, give our coat in addition to our shirt? In fact, I wonder if this was what He was thinking about through his whole Sermon discourse. &ldquo;Give to the one who asks you&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;You are the light of the world&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Blessed are the merciful&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasure on earth&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; What if this is what He meant?</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if this is what He wanted us to understand when He told the story about the Good Samaritan. I wonder if He wanted us actually to be like that. I wonder what our answer will be when we stand at heaven&rsquo;s gate ourselves and He asks what we did with &ldquo;the least of these&rdquo;. I wonder if our principles will matter to Him then. I wonder if we will suddenly realize that all we had was ours only by His grace and was always His to use to bless the people <em><strong>we</strong></em> counted unworthy. I wonder how much treasure we will have forfeited there while we withheld those blessings here. I wonder if we will see things then less as Americans, and more as human beings sharing the planet under the same rain, sun, and blessings of God as every other human being. I wonder what that perspective will do to our entitlement. I wonder if then right will be right regardless of race, color, or immigration status. And if wrong will be wrong even when a Christian is doing it?</p>\n\n<p>You know, it has always bothered me this trend in the evangelical church to dream big dreams about reaching exotic lands with the gospel of Christ, but never more than now. The poor are among us. But we don&rsquo;t like them. We don&rsquo;t want to serve them. We don&rsquo;t want to share with them from our abundance (which is maybe why the government has to <em><strong>force</strong></em> us to do it anyway!). We have judged them unworthy because they have not followed the rules. We would deny human beings&hellip;God&rsquo;s creation&hellip;the very basic levels of care because of &ldquo;principles&rdquo; based on the happy accident of our geography and the unhappy accident of theirs, and we would watch them DIE. AT. OUR. GATE. while we stand with our arms crossed demanding to know their status. We would be content to enjoy the blessings God has freely given us, and never consider sharing with a family in need who have violated our principles. And we do not even flinch in shame over it while we&rsquo;re buying our &ldquo;mission trip&rdquo; tickets to Africa. We spit in our neighbors&#39; eye by allowing their children to go to our schools&nbsp;hungry and&nbsp;barefoot&hellip;but we will travel across the world to serve more &ldquo;worthy&rdquo; people in need. Blessed assurance! Have mercy on us Lord! I hope you&rsquo;re blushing. If not, you might want to spend some time with Jeremiah, or you might want to consider one of God&rsquo;s reasons for condemning Sodom.&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.&rdquo;</em> (Ezekiel 16:49)<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nSo this is where I leave the conversation. In an instant, I&rsquo;ll be back wearing my political glasses and looking at things from my very entitled perspective astride this fence, tightly gripping my wallet in one hand and my flag in the other. The next financial aid meeting for Spanish speakers only that is held at my local public High School will likely tip me to the other side. The next scholarship I&nbsp;stumble across&nbsp;that is specifically for &ldquo;undocumented students&rdquo; will push me over the fence. And this is why this internal conversation is on-going for me. I have to choose whether I will suffer injustice for the sake of Christ and my fellow man, or not. It&rsquo;s really that simple. Jesus told us to weigh the cost. But ultimately the cost was his, and because He was <strong><em>willing </em></strong>to pay it (and didn&rsquo;t have to be <em><strong>forced </strong></em>to do so), we get to live on His dole forever. We get to move from a land that is not our own to a land that He will give us&hellip;no passport required, no green card necessary&hellip; so&hellip;go figure.</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For some reason, I&rsquo;ve recently been thinking about atheists.&nbsp; One online atheist I came across had a picture of a baby with a caption that read, &ldquo;We are all born atheists until someone starts telling us lies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is this true?&nbsp; Do we only come to a belief in God (or gods) if someone tells us this?&nbsp; (Of course, this begs the question of who told the first people about God, but I digress.)&nbsp; Or, do we have an innate belief in God?&nbsp; In other words, does God make sure everyone knows He exists?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thankfully, Scripture clearly addresses this.&nbsp; Romans 1 says, &ldquo;<em>18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 19 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. 20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. 21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.&nbsp; 24 Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. 25 For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In particular, notice vs. 19-20.&nbsp; God has made it <em>evident</em> to them.&nbsp; The word evident is <em>phaneroo</em>, which means to make known, to declare, to make visible that which is hidden.&nbsp; What did God make evident?&nbsp; That which is known about God:&nbsp; His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature.&nbsp; How did He make it evident?&nbsp; By His creation.&nbsp; Psalm 19 puts it this way:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>1 The heavens are telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands.&nbsp; 2 Day to day pours forth speech, And night to night reveals knowledge.&nbsp; 3 There is no speech, nor are there words; Their voice is not heard.&nbsp; 4 Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their utterances to the end of the world</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, notice that this is made evident <em>without</em> speech, without words.&nbsp; Thus, as Paul says in v. 20 above, God makes Himself known by what He has made, so that <em>all</em> are without excuse.&nbsp; Therefore, at judgment day, no one can say, &ldquo;If only I had known you existed God, I would have believed in you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Quite the contrary, <em>everyone</em> knows He exists.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Romans 2 also indirectly demonstrates our knowledge of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>14 For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, 15 in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them, 16 on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everyone has a conscience that tells us right and wrong.&nbsp; There can only be universal right and wrong if there is an absolute giver of morality, and that person is God.&nbsp; Therefore, the fact that everyone has a conscience and naturally knows right from wrong testifies to the existence of God.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many people who say they are atheists will say those who believe in God are stupid, or foolish.&nbsp; Ironically, Scripture says they are the fools.&nbsp; Professing to be wise they became fools.&nbsp; They exchanged the truth of God for a lie.&nbsp; Their foolish hearts were darkened.&nbsp; Indeed, Psalm 14:1 says, &ldquo;<em>The fool has said in his heart, &ldquo;There is no God</em>.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, when you speak to someone who says he&rsquo;s an atheist, he is 1) lying, and 2) a fool.&nbsp; He is like a person who says he doesn&rsquo;t believe in gravity.&nbsp; He sees how it works, he experiences its effects, but denies it exists.&nbsp; Truly, such a person is a fool.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do we as Christians answer the atheist?&nbsp; I have come to the conclusion that we simply tell them that they really do believe that God exists, because the Bible says they do.&nbsp; Even though they may deny it, they know in their heart that they do believe it.&nbsp; In other words, there really are no atheists.&nbsp; We tell them that they are suppressing this truth in unrighteousness, just as Scripture says.&nbsp; They may call you names, mock you, and hate you, all because you are telling them the truth.&nbsp; Most importantly, we give them the gospel.&nbsp; We should never think we are better, because God tells us &ldquo;<em>Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God</em>.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 6:11)&nbsp; May the Lord grant the atheists we meet the same grace He has given us.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~My son was the cutest baby and toddler you have ever seen. I know, I know. You protest. But truly, he really was. Everywhere we went people stopped to stare, and usually laugh. Tow-headed, rosy- cheeked, and in the 95th percentile for weight from birth until about age 3 &ndash; he was cherub chubby-bubby, alright?! I miss that baby. Something happens as the years pass and kids tend to grow up. Now he&rsquo;s a skinny, six-foot tall man with smelly feet and a beard. No one stops to stare except to laugh, but that&rsquo;s just the wardrobe. It&rsquo;s a phase. It will pass. I assure myself of this often.</p>\n\n<p>In my last post, I talked about Walby&rsquo;s Jacket, and wearing the righteousness of Christ, and growing into it through righteous living. Someone pointed out to me that I left out an important aspect of that whole train of thought. So I started thinking about it and what it means to actually do the work of righteous living when we don&rsquo;t have to. What&rsquo;s the payoff? Why go to the effort? I mean, at the end of our days, we will be wearing a jacket that fits us as if tailor-made, so why not just sail in on Jesus&rsquo; coattails. (That&rsquo;s called cheap grace, by the way.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Well consider this. My aforementioned son is now almost 18. What if my adorable 12-month-old had decided that he was not going to give up bink nor bottle? And what if my 14-month-old (yes&hellip;he was THAT old) decided that walking was really just too much trouble and he preferred to be carried? What if, at nearly 18 years old, we took him out to dinner and while we ate, he threw his food around the booth, tore his napkin into confetti, wet his pants and bawled loudly about it, then burped aloud without excusing himself and banged his spoon on the table until we left? All those things were cute at one time (although some misguided individuals thought it annoying even then), but it would not be cute if he hadn&rsquo;t actually overcome them at some point.</p>\n\n<p>See what I mean? A Christian who has the full righteousness of Christ is not mature and complete until he grows into the behavior that demonstrates Christ&rsquo;s righteousness. Instead, he&rsquo;s like a baby-Huey: a big overgrown baby-Christian who&rsquo;s still on a bottle and never graduated to solid food, never learned to walk on his own, always has to be carried, and is always in need of other people&rsquo;s grace.</p>\n\n<p>God has instituted certain developmental milestones in human life. It is a natural rite of passage for every child to move through these stages. If a child (like my 14-month-old walker) doesn&rsquo;t hit that stage as quickly as other children do, moms worry! These signs of growth are natural. Growth is expected. It&rsquo;s celebrated. And as every milestone is completed, we eagerly anticipate the next one until we&rsquo;re packing their bags and getting ready to send them off to college amid the weeping, wailing, gnashing of teeth&hellip; oh&hellip;sorry&hellip;I have these moments every now and then. Milestones! Yes! They are good!! They are natural. And if a child gets stunted along the way, we seek immediate intervention. But not so in the church. Why is that?</p>\n\n<p>As I thought about all this, I realized that for the child, the milestone &ndash; the growth itself &ndash; brings its own reward of greater independence and choice. They learn to feed themselves. They learn to move themselves from one point to another to achieve a goal. They learn self-comfort. They learn to read and gather information. They learn to play and get along with others, and how to defend themselves on the playground. They learn the value of knowledge - and how to get it. Then they learn to use it! And on and on and on. It&rsquo;s an exercise in self-actualization. Maybe that&rsquo;s the wrong term &ndash; too new age. It&rsquo;s an exercise in becoming what God intended from the beginning. Completeness. Life to the fullest. And the plan is no different for the Christian.</p>\n\n<p>I was an adult when I started walking with God. Only I didn&rsquo;t. Walk, that is. I did what babies do. I sat there in church completely helpless and let people feed me. (I was the one in adult Sunday school who, like Horshack, never put my hand down.) But then I wanted to know how they knew all this stuff and I started to get information for myself. I learned how to feed myself. Then I started watching how these Christian people did this thing, and I started to mimic them (not always the best way to learn good habits!). I started to crawl and then walk. Then I started to do some bigger things on my own. I messed things up, bawled about it, started again, and got it right the next time. And on the process goes.</p>\n\n<p>Now here&rsquo;s the thing. As my son has grown and added new skills and understanding to his maturity, he has become an even greater joy to me. I am thrilled to sit and have a conversation with this strange and fascinating alien-like creature, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what comes next. I am watching every moment, every experience, every change, knowing that one day those things will become his treasure. One day he will open the lid of the box, and there it will all be gleaming back at him, everything he needs for a full, healthy, functioning, wonderful life gathered together and waiting for him to cash in. This is how we gather treasure in heaven too. We constantly move forward in our growth until one day we open the box to realize that we have all we need to look like our Dad. Sound like our Dad. Act like our Dad. And voila! That is our treasure and very great reward! Everything we gathered as we grew is now fully developed and ready to deploy.</p>\n\n<p>Now one last thought. Have any of you, as you&rsquo;ve gotten old enough to borrow from your parent&rsquo;s closet, slipped on a jacket and found money stashed in a pocket? (I usually only found used tissues, but such is my lot.) Yeah. Treasure in heaven is like that too. We get all the benefit of being able to wear dad&rsquo;s coat, but there&rsquo;s a bonus to boot: a little something extra tucked away just for this very occasion. One last nod in our direction. One last affirmation that the jacket finally fits and we are man (or woman) enough to wear it. So&hellip;grow. Grow into that jacket. It&rsquo;s reward enough on its own not to be stuck on the cradle-roll, but the benefits&hellip;well&hellip;who knows what&rsquo;s tucked in that jacket just waiting for you to be big enough to wear it?!</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&rsquo;d been there before, a couple of times.&nbsp; It bothered me then, but I didn&rsquo;t say anything.&nbsp; This last time, though, I couldn&rsquo;t help myself; I had to say something.&nbsp; Like Paul at Athens, my spirit was provoked within me.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I was at a Christian bookstore, and they had a small collection of books they called &ldquo;Catholic Corner&rdquo;.&nbsp; I wanted to ask them why they didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;Mormon Corner&rdquo;, or a &ldquo;Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness&rdquo; corner.&nbsp; Instead, I engaged an employee and asked why they were selling Catholic books.&nbsp; What transpired was a disturbing display of Scriptural ignorance.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I don&rsquo;t mean to sound arrogant here, but this IS a Christian bookstore.&nbsp; They have a certain level of responsibility to not sell books that are going to lead Christians astray.&nbsp; As a result, they should have a level of Scriptural understanding to ensure they aren&rsquo;t selling any unbiblical books.&nbsp; (Amazingly, one of the Catholic books for sale was about the false doctrine of purgatory, written, in a positive way, by a Protestant!)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I first asked this person if she knew what Catholics believed about salvation.&nbsp; Her answer was that they believe in Jesus and pray to the pope to go to heaven.&nbsp; This is not even what the Catholic church teaches.&nbsp; There were several other things about Catholicism she didn&rsquo;t understand, which only made the fact that they were selling Catholic books all the worse.&nbsp; The bottom line is that she believed the Catholic church was simply another denomination, like Baptists or Methodists.&nbsp; Her main reason was that because they believe in the Trinity, they are Christian.&nbsp; While it would be true to say that belief in the Trinity is necessary to be a Christian, is belief in the Trinity what makes a person a Christian?&nbsp; According to Scripture, the answer is clearly no.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are at least two places in Scripture that show us this.&nbsp; First, James 2:19 says, &ldquo;<em>You believe that God is one.&nbsp; You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do the demons believe God is &ldquo;one&rdquo; and not a Trinity?&nbsp; Remember, the demons at one point were angels.&nbsp; They know what God is like.&nbsp; They know God is &ldquo;one&rdquo; in the sense of Deuteronomy 6:4:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one</em>!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Hebrew for &ldquo;one&rdquo; is echad, the same word used in Genesis 2:24 speaking of a man and woman becoming &ldquo;one&rdquo; flesh.&nbsp; It is not a singular one, but a unity of one.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Maybe I&rsquo;m stretching this interpretation, except that Jesus&rsquo; encounter with demons shows that is not the case.&nbsp; In Matthew 8, Jesus encounters two demon possessed men, and the demons are clearly terrified of Jesus.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>29 And they cried out, saying, &ldquo;What business do we have with each other, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?&rdquo; 30 Now there was a herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them. 31 The demons began to entreat Him, saying, &ldquo;If You are going to cast us out, send us into the herd of swine.&rdquo; 32 And He said to them, &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; And they came out and went into the swine, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The term &ldquo;before the time&rdquo; refers to the time God will send the devil and his angels into the lake of fire (Matthew 25:41).&nbsp; God is the one who will send them into the lake of fire, so clearly the demons were acknowledging Jesus as God, thus recognizing the second person of the Trinity.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Second, in Galatians 1, Paul condemns the Judaizers for teaching a false gospel.&nbsp; They were teaching that to be saved, one had to believe in Jesus but also be circumcised.&nbsp; This is the only thing for which Paul condemns them.&nbsp; The implication is that they recognized Jesus as God, otherwise Paul would have surely condemned them for teaching He was not God.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, we can see that a person can believe in the Trinity yet not be a Christian.&nbsp; As Galatians shows, however, a person cannot have a false gospel and still be a Christian.&nbsp; Yet, this is exactly what the Catholic church teaches.&nbsp; In addition to faith in Christ, the Catholic church falsely teaches (among other things) that a person must also become inherently righteous by doing good works.&nbsp; This denies the imputation of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness to the believer (see Romans 4 and 5).&nbsp; As a result, this bookstore is selling books related to a church that has a false gospel.&nbsp; This is no different than if they were selling Mormon or Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness books.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The really sad part, however, was this person&rsquo;s knowledge of Scripture.&nbsp; As I gave her several passages of Scripture that demonstrated the false gospel of Catholicism, it was clear she was not that familiar with the Bible.&nbsp; She finally said she was comfortable selling Catholic books because wise men taught that Catholics were Christians.&nbsp; She specifically mentioned C.S. Lewis, and said he converted to Catholicism (he didn&rsquo;t).</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are not to rely on the wisdom of men, especially when such &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; contradicts God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; As 1 Corinthians 1:25 says, &ldquo;<em>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sadly, that is not what this particular Christian bookstore has chosen to do.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What does this have to do with believers?&nbsp; Proverbs 23:7 says, &ldquo;<em>For as he thinks within himself, so he is</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore, what we think makes a difference.&nbsp; What we think drives how we behave.&nbsp; If Christians believe that Catholics are simply another denomination, that they are Christians, then they will not witness to them.&nbsp; This potentially leads believers into disobedience, albeit disobedience borne out of ignorance.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just as Paul&rsquo;s spirit was provoked by all the idols he saw in Athens, our spirits should be provoked when we encounter false teaching, especially when it&rsquo;s being peddled to believers as truth.&nbsp; False teaching robs God of His glory, and can lead believers astray.&nbsp; The solution to this is for believers to study God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; As Romans 12:2 says, &ldquo;<em>And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect</em>.&rdquo;</p>"

One of the boys &ndash; they call him Walby, so we do too &ndash; had on an unusual jacket, and my husband mentioned it. When the boys began to actually notice the article of clothing (they don&rsquo;t usually, you know) it became apparent to us all that it didn&rsquo;t fit. In this case, it was too small. So small, in fact, that he had the sleeves pushed way up on his arms so no one would notice how short they were. Amid the ribbing that ensued, Walby offered no explanation, so the too-small jacket shall remain a mystery &ndash; but I remembered it later.</p>\n\n<p>My church, and therefore the youth cell groups, is beginning a yearlong study of the book of Romans. I&rsquo;m excited about this and so is my son&rsquo;s group leader, who laid down the law about working through it not only with diligence but with prayer and a teachable spirit. He gave them a brief introduction, (I&rsquo;m listening from the other room where I&rsquo;m supposed to be ignoring everything that goes on during their meeting&hellip;HA! Like THAT&rsquo;S gonna happen!) and then he began to discuss and define some terms that they would come across in the meaty book. One of those terms was righteousness. (And here follows the explanation for why I eavesdrop on their meetings.) As I have heard it preached and taught many times before, the group leader launched an explanation of biblical righteousness that comingled the righteousness of Christ with righteous living, and the definition became completely muddied and unclear. I&rsquo;m sure the boys all left with the idea that while they have the righteousness of Christ&hellip;they have to work hard to get it.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWhen these little&hellip;um&hellip;distortions arise I make it a point to have a follow up conversation with my son about them, and this evening was no exception. As I was trying to unsnarl the knot his group leader had tangled, I struggled to find a way to explain how we can have the righteousness of Christ and still be working at righteousness, and then I thought of Walby&rsquo;s jacket. Righteousness is like Walby&rsquo;s jacket in reverse. See&hellip;we have clothed ourselves with the righteousness of Christ, but it&rsquo;s a jacket so big that we&rsquo;re swimming in it &ndash; so big in fact that, blessedly, it&rsquo;s all God can see. We&rsquo;re in there somewhere underneath the yards and yards of fabric, but we&rsquo;re just flapping sleeves all over the place and trying to keep it from dragging the ground when we walk! We need time to fill it out, to grow into it; while God is seeing nothing but Christ all over us, we are in there trying to get our arms in the sleeves and our neck through the right hole.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, unlike Walby, we will never outgrow our jacket, but how well it eventually fits is always our choice. Although we could choose to continue to struggle and flap about in an oversized garment but being content with what we have, the hope is that we will grow until we are comfortable wearing it. In other words, I can be fully covered by the righteousness of Christ, be content with the fact that God is satisfied, and never move beyond that point in my life. Or I can work out my salvation with fear and trembling until my life actually fits the image. I&rsquo;m sure that I will always have to push the sleeves up on my jacket lest they dangle past my fingertips, but in my wildest heart-longings I dream of a day when not only the sleeves fit, but the buttons just barely meet in the middle and strain a little to maintain hold. Oh, blessed Lord, bring me to a place where your righteousness is like a second skin. Not exactly like Walby&rsquo;s jacket, but as close as earthly possible.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~In general, I am disinterested in sports. That may be understating my feelings a bit, but I want to remain respectful of other points of view. However, my opinion is that as a society, we have sold our souls to a piece of leather. We have lost our ever-loving minds. We have made idols of men who do nothing more important than run in circles. We protect &ndash; indeed support &ndash; institutions that encourage lying, cheating, and stealing; ignore child molesters in their midst; sacrifice their own members to the degradation of their minds and bodies then cast them off like so much chaff. We know that they do these things and yet&hellip;we jump up and down, taking leave of our senses, and with painted faces like aboriginal natives worshipping our gods, scream and shout, wave our hands in the air, and make faces no one wants to see on Sunday night television, all in the name faithful fandom. Someday maybe I can share with you how I <em><strong>really</strong></em> feel, but this is not a post about sports except that football, in particular, is useful in terms of an analogy. And it&rsquo;s a sport most people can follow. It&rsquo;s not rocket science after all.</p>\n\n<p>I was talking today with a friend of mine whose son is a friend of my son&rsquo;s. There is imbedded tension in every aspect of those relationships. Both boys know that both parents talk. That means they don&rsquo;t - at least not to us about each other if they can help it - but today my son shared something her son shared and I shared with her and then we shared together.&nbsp;And&nbsp;what we shared was deeper than either of us originally thought, and more troubling. And it made me despair. It seems so often that evil is winning.</p>\n\n<p>Do you ever look around you and just see evil in a huddle on the other side of the field plotting a battle plan against you that can&rsquo;t be defended? Trying to do this Christian thing is often like facing the giants (see what I did there?) and losing every time. I see my mom-friends blindsided (uh huh&hellip;there too) and left reeling. I start the day with a good plan and then face a blitz that I can&rsquo;t push through. I see church members running well just to get clotheslined and go down hard. Marriages dropkicked. Ministries clipped. The enemy is running down the clock while we nurse our injuries on the sideline. But this is what I had to remind my friend of today: the clock is running down. The enemy might be winning right now, but it&rsquo;s only the third quarter.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nI have another friend who would so hate this post. She sees no reason why any Christian should believe for a minute that the enemy is winning. I want to be a Pollyanna&hellip;uh&hellip;good Christian like her, but I am far too realistic, and I&rsquo;m sorry to say, sometimes evil wins. Because the game is not over. Cancer wins. Car wrecks win. Pornography wins. Adultery wins. Divorce wins. Alcohol wins. Injustice wins. Liars, cheaters, thieves, and child molesters win. (Sometimes they even set their trophies in glass cases as monuments to their glory won on the backs of innocents. ) Evil is winning, and we have not learned how to fight on the devil&rsquo;s playing field. It&rsquo;s time we got in the game, ice-packs and all!</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how we fight. We remind ourselves that first and foremost we are saved with a salvation that is secure, and no matter how things are right now, this is not our home and we are not benched here forever. (That is one helmet that will protect your brain right there folks!) Then we suit up with a righteousness that does not cave to dirty play, no matter the temptation, and we block with a faith that GOD IS...and is for us so anything that comes at us only makes us stronger. We tuck that truth in our rosin bag and we strap it on, gumming up our hands with it so we can hang on to the ball when it comes our way, and then we run. We run with perseverance to let others know that this game is not over yet &ndash; we may be bleeding, but we&rsquo;re running!&nbsp; There is one Hail Mary left to hurl to Jesus, our wide receiver waiting in the end zone, and He will not drop the ball. He will not fumble on the goal line. He will not leave us punting from deep in our own territory.</p>\n\n<p>But while we play, we&rsquo;re gonna get creamed. We&rsquo;re gonna take a lot of hits and sometimes we&rsquo;re going to fall well behind the line of scrimmage. Some days will feel like we&rsquo;re at 4th down with 100 yards to go. But we do not give up. We do not quit. We do not go quietly into that dark night. We reach down deep into that hope that does not disappoint, where God is faithful to all that we have entrusted to Him, and we <em><strong>press on</strong></em>. Because until the clock runs down and the last whistle blows, we&rsquo;re still in this game, and our job is to defend our zone and take the enemy&rsquo;s territory. One yard at a time.</p>\n\n<p>(And there you have the only way to truly redeem football &ndash; make it all about the glory of God.)&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the years, there have been several books written (and even some movies made) about people who have allegedly had &ldquo;near death experiences&rdquo;.&nbsp; Many of these people said they went to heaven, saw God, angels and even the devil.&nbsp; These stories, books, and movies have been, appropriately, labeled as &ldquo;heavenly tourism&rdquo;, due to the claims that these people got a tour of heaven.&nbsp; For the most part, Christians cheered such stories, apparently out of a desire to show that heaven and God are indeed real after all.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sad part is that most Christians today lack the discernment that even a limited study of the Bible would demonstrate that these claims are false.&nbsp; We have some articles about this <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/devotionals/life_after_life_examining_near_death_experiences\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/devotionals/heaven-is-for-real-but-the-book-movie-are-not\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In 2010, there was a book titled <em>The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven</em>, published by Tyndale House Publishers, a company that publishes Christian books.&nbsp; It was also made into a television movie.&nbsp; The book is about a boy, Alex Malarkey, who was in a traffic accident in 2004.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He claimed he died and went to heaven, gives specifics on what the devil looks like, that there&rsquo;s a hole in heaven through which people come up from earth, and other un-Biblical views of heaven.&nbsp; Sadly, Tyndale and other Christian book publishers love these types of books because they sell.&nbsp; They do not seem interested in whether or not they are true.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although the falseness of these books is obvious if one simply compares what they say to what Scripture says, the co-author of this particular book recently released a statement so as to remove any doubt.&nbsp; Alex himself put out this short note on the Pulpit and Pen website on January 13, 2015:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h6 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>&ldquo;An Open Letter to Lifeway and Other Sellers, Buyers, and Marketers of Heaven Tourism, by the Boy Who Did Not Come Back From Heaven.&rdquo;</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Please forgive the brevity, but because of my limitations I have to keep this short.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>I did not die. I did not go to Heaven.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention. When I made the claims that I did, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough. The Bible is the only source of truth. Anything written by man cannot be infallible.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>It is only through repentance of your sins and a belief in Jesus as the Son of God, who died for your sins (even though he committed none of his own) so that you can be forgiven may you learn of Heaven outside of what is written in the Bible&hellip;not by reading a work of man. I want the whole world to know that the Bible is sufficient. Those who market these materials must be called to repent and hold the Bible as enough.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>In Christ,</em></h6>\n\n<h6 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Alex Malarkey.&rdquo;</em></h6>\n\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />\nWe praise God that Alex has issued this statement.&nbsp; Although other Christians, as well as Verse by Verse Ministry, have warned believers that these stories are un-Biblical, it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the author of one of these stories flatly stating that he lied about his &ldquo;experience&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sadly, the Christian publishers and sellers of these books ignored this, despite knowing for quite some time that Alex&rsquo;s story was a lie.&nbsp; Well known Christian apologists Phil Johnson and Justin Peters, working with Alex&rsquo;s mom, Beth Malarkey, have tried to get the publisher to pull this book from the market for about two years.&nbsp; It was not until Alex&rsquo;s recent statement that Tyndale pulled the book, and publicly acknowledged Alex&rsquo;s statement that the book was not true.&nbsp; Similarly, Lifeway, a Christian bookstore, also knew this story was false, yet continued to sell this book despite being told it was a lie.&nbsp; They, too, just recently removed the book from their stores.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, I doubt Lifeway and other Christian bookstores (as well as publishers) will pull ALL of these &ldquo;heavenly tourism&rdquo; books from their stores.&nbsp; The books appeal to emotions, and so many Christians apparently desire emotional books.&nbsp; As a result, the publishers and the bookstores ignore what Scripture says, all so they can profit from books that are clearly un-Biblical and therefore untrue.&nbsp; Alex&rsquo;s story makes it clear that this is the case.&nbsp; While we don&rsquo;t expect similar recanting from other authors, these books should be pulled immediately to ensure believers are not mislead.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, this has the potential to be seen as a mark against the truth of Christianity.&nbsp; The world&rsquo;s newspapers and websites are all over this breaking story, some, no doubt, happy that this negatively reflects on Christianity.&nbsp; On the other hand, it&rsquo;s good that the truth of these false, near death experiences is being made known.&nbsp; If more people know they&rsquo;re false, there&rsquo;s less chance more of these books will be published in the future.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This whole issue highlights the fact that believers should always test all things against Scripture, to see if they are so (Acts 17).&nbsp;We should not let our emotions drive what we believe.&nbsp; God does not appeal to us through emotions, but through our mind.&nbsp; In Isaiah 1:18, He says, &ldquo;Come now, and let us reason together.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lord tells us to renew our minds:&nbsp; &ldquo;And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.&rdquo; (Romans 12:2) &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Now that we are in Christ, we are to grow to maturity in Him, so that &ldquo;14 As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; 15 but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, 16 from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.&rdquo;&nbsp; This can only be done by studying the word of God, by which the Holy Spirit will sanctify and mature us.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I&rsquo;m thankful that Alex Malarkey repented and told the truth.&nbsp; However, Christians should have been suspect of his story from the beginning.&nbsp; Some will no doubt say it&rsquo;s a coincidence, but have you considered his last name?&nbsp; &ldquo;Malarkey - speech or writing designed to obscure, mislead, or impress; bunkum.&rdquo;&nbsp; How true it is in this situation.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe in coincidences; even in the name, God mercifully warned believers about this book.&nbsp; Better yet, go to the Word, which is the Truth (John 14:6).&nbsp; The Word is all we need to know that God and heaven are real.</p>"

Times Square is filled with people who watch a crystal ball descend as midnight approaches. Millions more watch on television. When the ball ends its journey a massive celebration erupts. People are excited about the promise of a new calendar year. They hope the disappointments of the previous year will be replaced by better times in the new year.<br />\n<br />\nBut the jubilant celebrations often fade into dismal hangovers, just like last year and the year before that, doing the same thing over and over again. People believe they can make things better by their own effort and will. What promised to be new has become old again&hellip; People believe they can make things better by their own effort and will.</blockquote>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Younts goes on to point out that, while a new year begins, apart from knowing Messiah an old heart remains. As one of my family members so colorfully put it:<br /> \"Ain&rsquo;t no New Year&rsquo;s resolution gonna fix that!\"</p>\n\n<p>Want to get out of debt?

This is about <strong>genuine</strong> change, <strong>meaningful</strong> change, and <strong>lasting</strong> change.</p>\n\n<h6>You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. (Ephesians 4:22-24)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That is the work of Messiah in you.</p>\n\n<p>Next month we&rsquo;ll look at the promise that G-d causes all things to work together for good.</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat shalom!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~A friend of mine has tied all her childhood baggage to the top of her car and is headed to Texas to bury her mother. Funny that no matter how many years pass, the effects of our childhood mark us with indelible permanence. We can learn to overcome it, work around it, compensate for it, distance ourselves from it, and hide it from ourselves and others, but it never really goes away. When faced with those old surroundings and circumstances and people, the baggage begins to pile up, and we begin to live out of those old suitcases.</p>\n\n<p>Sigh. Yes, I just heaved a sigh, because the enormity of it overwhelms me. I know this struggle and I long to lift this burden from her. And from me. When you come from a home of dysfunction (not the psycho-babble first world type of dysfunction, but the version that includes abuse of every kind named in the books), so many things trigger the latch on your bags and they suddenly spring open and spill their contents across the floor, demanding that you wear these things! Dirty shirts. Torn pants. Worn shoes. Things that don&rsquo;t fit any longer, but you wear them anyway. Old shame. Old failure. Old habits. Things purchased for you, in many cases, by others, without regard for your own tastes or desires. Like getting a bunch of stuff for Christmas that wasn&rsquo;t on your wish list. Stuff you convince yourself to accept, but know you don&rsquo;t want. All packed into suitcases that you carry with you everywhere like Jacob Marley&rsquo;s chains.</p>\n\n<p>In some things, I have made enough progress to look at the guts of my suitcases spilled out in front of me like a wardrobe of accusations and I&rsquo;m able to pick and choose what I wear. Some things I can assess with clarity and decide that, no, that was not mine from the beginning. It was a hand-me-down that never fit. It was entirely the wrong color. I hated it from the start and I&rsquo;m not wearing it again. Period. Other things still feel&hellip;comfortable. Even when they strangle me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how far my friend has come in sorting out her bags, but today she is facing these choices in a very real way. She has to decide if she will slip back into the hated but comfortable family role that has defined her place among her people for decades, or if she will buck the expectation and rise above that. If she chooses to rise, there will be fall-out: name-calling, reminders, histrionics, and manipulations. The ripples from her choice will be far-reaching and may spring a few other latches, which will then demand attention&hellip;and retribution. There is always a price to pay for freedom. But that is the very thing that she and I, and all of us who are constantly living out of an old&nbsp;suitcase must remember: the price for our freedom has been paid.</p>\n\n<p>As those who are now clothed with the glory of Christ, we have the strength within us to stand without flinching in the midst of our toppled baggage with all of our old shame exposed. We have a new name, a new family, and a new identity that is eternally unaffected by our own or anyone else&rsquo;s opinion, assessment, accusation, attack, or attempt to discredit. You, my friend, are a child of God. There is no other name on your luggage tag. There is only one bag that you need to carry, and nothing in that bag but the radiance of Christ. It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s such a small bag, demanding so little effort and bearing so little weight, that you forget it contains everything you need. Clutch it to your chest and let the rest fall open where they may. Squeeze your eyes shut tight as you stand in the middle of the mess spilled out around you, and hum &ldquo;The Old Rugged Cross&rdquo;. But whatever you do, do not pick up another dirty shirt and pull it over your tear-stained face while your spirit cries out in objection! Pack the bags and drag them with you if you insist&hellip;but <em><strong>live </strong></em>out of one new suitcase. The only one that matters.&nbsp;</p>"

Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are. 12 While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me; and I guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled&hellip;.20 &ldquo;I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; 21 that they may all be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.&nbsp; 22 The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, just as We are one; 23 I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have loved Me. 24 Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are several things to notice here.&nbsp; First, Jesus is praying for unity of believers, not unity with the world.&nbsp; Second, Jesus is praying for a unity so close that He compares it to the unity Jesus has with the Father &ndash; they are one, and there is no disagreement in the Trinity.&nbsp; Finally, Jesus prays for this unity so that the world may believe that the Father sent the Son into the world, and loved believers even as He loved His Son.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ephesians 4 gives us more insight into the unity of believers:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>1 Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, 2 with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, 3 being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6 one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all&hellip;.11 And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, 12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; 13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While much could be said about this, at a minimum our unity is in the Spirit, a unity of faith, and unity in the knowledge of the Son of God.&nbsp; Much of the above is learned (God provided pastors and teachers), and if learned, it must be from Scripture.&nbsp; Therefore, if believers are to have unity, this unity must be defined by the word of God.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So where am I going with all this?&nbsp; Well, recently, Rick Warren went to the Vatican to speak at a conference, entitled, &ldquo;An International Interreligious Colloquium on The Complementarity of Man and Woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; While there, Warren was interviewed by Catholic News Service, and made some very disturbing comments about Christian unity with the Catholic church (see video below).</p>\n\n\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/A7ukO7ENRMw?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n\n\n<p>In particular, Warren said that Christians have much more in common with Catholics than they have differences:&nbsp; &ldquo;Well they would all say we believe in the Trinity, we believe in the Bible, we believe in the resurrection, we believe salvation is through Jesus Christ. These are the big issues.\"</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While this sounds good, and it&rsquo;s true that the Catholic church does believe some of what Scripture teaches, it&rsquo;s what Warren doesn&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s much more important.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s look at the false teaching of the Catholic church that Warren glosses over.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>SALVATION AND THE TRUE GOSPEL</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Warren says that both Catholics and Christians believe that salvation is through Jesus Christ, but that&rsquo;s not really true.&nbsp; In fact, you could say he left out one very important word, a word that drives a chasm larger than the Grand Canyon between Catholics and Christians:&nbsp; <em>alone</em>.&nbsp; Scripture is clear that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Catholic church does not believe this.&nbsp; They believe that salvation is by faith <em>and</em> by works.&nbsp; This was officially (and &ldquo;infallibly&rdquo;) declared at the Council of Trent in the 1500s:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CANON IX.-If any one saith, that by faith alone the impious is justified; in such wise as to mean, that nothing else is required to co-operate in order to the obtaining the grace of Justification, and that it is not in any way necessary, that he be prepared and disposed by the movement of his own will; let him be anathema.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CANON XI.-If any one saith, that men are justified, either by the sole imputation of the justice of Christ, or by the sole remission of sins, to the exclusion of the grace and the charity which is poured forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inherent in them; or even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the favour of God; let him be anathema.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CANON XXIV.-If any one saith, that the justice received is not preserved and also increased before God through good works; but that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of Justification obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof; let him be anathema.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CANON XXVI.-If any one saith, that the just ought not, for their good works done in God, to expect and hope for an eternal recompense from God, through His mercy and the merit of Jesus Christ, if so be that they persevere to the end in well doing and in keeping the divine commandments; let him be anathema.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you can see, the Catholic church rejects the imputation of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness (Canons IX and XI).&nbsp; Instead, they teach that a person&rsquo;s works makes one righteous (&ldquo;increases justification&rdquo; - Canons XXIV and XXVI).&nbsp; This is in direct contradiction to Scripture, as Ephesians 2 makes clear:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. 10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scripture is plain:&nbsp; salvation is by faith, which comes as a gift from God, not of works so no one may boast.&nbsp; This faith in is Christ, who is our righteousness, our justification.&nbsp; Just as Adam&rsquo;s sin made us sinners, Christ&rsquo;s obedience justifies us and makes us righteous:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>19 For as through the one man&rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous</em>.&rdquo; (Romans 5)&nbsp; Our good works do not make us righteous, but Jesus&rsquo; do. &nbsp;Furthermore, we are born again <em>for</em> good works, not for our salvation, but so that we would walk in them, living holy lives to the glory of God.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Comparing Catholicism&rsquo;s official teaching to Scripture, we can see that the Catholic church has a false gospel.&nbsp; As a result, it is a false church.&nbsp; Rick Warren should know that this is official Catholic teaching, and should therefore have nothing to do with the Catholic church, much less claim unity.&nbsp; We can never have unity with those who have a false gospel.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>MARY</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Warren said this about Catholicism&rsquo;s view of Mary:&nbsp; &ldquo;Sometimes Protestants think that Catholics worship Mary like she&rsquo;s another god. &nbsp;But that&rsquo;s not exactly Catholic doctrine.&rdquo;&nbsp; While I generally try not to discuss Mary with Catholics (as this only takes us away from a discussion of the gospel), it&rsquo;s helpful for Christians to know what the Catholic church does teach about Mary.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Catholic church does state that they do not &ldquo;worship&rdquo; Mary in the same way they worship God.&nbsp; They claim they have <em>dulia</em> (veneration) for the saints, and <em>hyperdulia</em> (special veneration) for Mary, but reserve <em>latria</em> (worship) for God alone.&nbsp; Practically speaking, there is no real difference.&nbsp; Indeed and ironically, New Advent, a Catholic online encyclopedia, says this about dulia and latria:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Latria (latreia) in classical Greek originally meant \"the state of a hired servant\" (Aesch., \"Prom.\", 966), and so service generally. It is used especially for Divine service (Plato, \"Apol.\", 23 B). In Christian literature it came to have a technical sense for the supreme honour due to His servants, the angels and saints. This latter was styled \"dulia\". <u><strong>Etymologically, however, there is no reason why latria should be preferred to designate supreme honour; and indeed the two words were often used indiscriminately</strong></u>. The distinction is due to St. Augustine, who says: \"Latria . . . ea dicitur servitus quae pertinet ad colendum Deum\" (City of God X.1).&rdquo; (my emphasis added)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having grown up Catholic, I can personally attest to Mary worship.&nbsp; The false distinction the Catholic church claims between veneration and worship simply does not exist.&nbsp; I have seen Mary worship firsthand.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What&rsquo;s worse, the Catholic church also teaches that Mary is a &ldquo;co-redemptrix&rdquo;, a &ldquo;mediatrix&rdquo; along with Jesus:&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore the Blessed Virgin is invoked by the Church under the titles of Advocate, Auxiliatrix, Adjutrix, and Mediatrix.(16*) This, however, is to be so understood that it neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator.(17*)&rdquo; (source:&nbsp; Lumen Gentium, paragraph 62)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although the Catholic church is quick to say Mary does not replace Jesus as the one Mediator between God and man, it is again a distinction without a practical difference, similar to hyperdulia and latria.&nbsp; Catholics are taught to come to Jesus through Mary.&nbsp; Indeed, Lumen Gentium states, &ldquo;Taken up to heaven she did not lay aside this salvific duty, but by her constant intercession continued to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, the practical view of Mary by Catholics results in Catholics praying to Mary for salvation, who then prays to her Son.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is completely unbiblical and is idolatrous.&nbsp; Even worse, it robs the glory due to God alone in the work of salvation.&nbsp; It is the Father who elects (John 6:37), it is the Son who forgives sins and makes us righteous (Romans 5), and it is the Holy Spirit who causes us to be born again and sanctifies us (John 3, Romans 15:16).&nbsp; No person, even Mary, has any part in our salvation.&nbsp; Salvation is from the Lord (Jonah 2:9), and from Him alone.&nbsp; As a pastor and teacher, Warren should know better.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>THE BIBLE</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Warren also said, &ldquo;&hellip;we believe in the Bible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, the Catholic church has a Bible that includes seven additional books in the Old Testament that was never part of the Jewish Old Testament (known as the Apocrypha, which includes the books Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, and Baruch).</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are several problems with these books.&nbsp; Unlike the Old Testament, no prophet wrote any of these books.&nbsp; In the New Testament, neither Jesus nor any of the apostles quote from any of these books.&nbsp; Some of these books contain historical and geographical errors.&nbsp; Some even contradict Scripture (e.g., Tobit teaches magic, and says almsgiving purges sins; 2 Maccabees teaches salvation by works and prayers for the dead).&nbsp; For these and other reasons, the church historically never fully accepted the Apocrypha as divinely inspired until the Council of Trent &ldquo;infallibly&rdquo; declared them to be Scripture.&nbsp; To this day, Christians reject these books.&nbsp; The Catholic church says that anyone who rejects these books as part of Holy Scripture is to be accursed.&nbsp; This begs the question, does Rick Warren accept these books?&nbsp; If not, how can he possibly say we believe in the same Bible?&nbsp; Warren should know better.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>UNITY FOR WARREN EQUATES TO &ldquo;IF YOU LOVE JESUS&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given the extremely serious differences noted above, how does Warren ultimately determine unity?&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;But the most important thing is if you love Jesus, we&rsquo;re on the same team.&rdquo;&nbsp; Given this is Warren&rsquo;s ultimate test for unity, he would logically also have to claim unity with Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses.&nbsp; They both claim to love Jesus, so he must embrace them as well.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, the question becomes &ldquo;what Jesus do we love?&rdquo;&nbsp; This takes us back to Jesus&rsquo; prayer for unity, and Paul&rsquo;s appeal for the church&rsquo;s unity.&nbsp; As a necessity, our unity is based in Scripture.&nbsp; As such, the Jesus we love must be the Jesus of the Bible.&nbsp; As we saw above, the Catholic church denies this Jesus.&nbsp; They do not believe His very words.&nbsp; They deny the true gospel.&nbsp; They add books to God&rsquo;s closed book of Scripture (Revelation 22:18).&nbsp; They worship a creature rather than the Creator.&nbsp; Friends, this is not unity, nor can it ever be.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people may read this and think, &ldquo;Should you really be calling out Warren by name?&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t you being pretty harsh?&nbsp; Shouldn&rsquo;t you speak in generalities?&rdquo;&nbsp; No.&nbsp; If I knew there was a dangerous, large pothole in the road near your house, should I tell you to watch out for potholes, or should I tell you about the specific pothole that I know you&rsquo;ll have to drive by?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Paul calls out Hymenaeus and Alexander as two who rejected the faith and made a shipwreck of it (1 Timothy 1:20).&nbsp; In 2 Timothy 4, Paul warned about a specific person who opposed his teaching:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. 15 Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Likewise, we should be on guard against those who oppose Scripture, including those who promote false teachers.&nbsp; Naming names makes sense, to ensure we know who to avoid.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, some of Scripture&rsquo;s harshest words are reserved for false teachers, especially where the gospel is concerned.&nbsp; Galatians 1 says, &ldquo;<em>6 I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; 7 which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed! 9 As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed</em>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Rick Warren should know better than to claim unity with a church that has a false gospel.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, Warren is not concerned with unity based on the gospel or Scripture.&nbsp; Rather, his focus on unity is based on &ldquo;the church&rdquo; doing things.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;The unity that I think we would see realistically is not a structural unity but a unity of mission. And so, when it comes to the family we are co-workers in the field on this for the protection of what we call the sanctity of life, the sanctity of sex, and the sanctity of marriage. So there&rsquo;s a great commonality and there&rsquo;s no division on any of those three.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&rsquo;s admirable to desire a Biblical view of the family, abortion, and marriage.&nbsp; But we are never to try to achieve unity in anything at the expense of the gospel.&nbsp; We never, ever see anything like that in Scripture.&nbsp; In fact, just the opposite.&nbsp; 2 Corinthians 6 says, &ldquo;<em>14 Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness? 15 Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? 16 Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, &ldquo;I will dwell in them and walk among them; And I will be their God, and they shall be My people.&nbsp; 17 &ldquo;Therefore, come out from their midst and be separate,&rdquo; says the Lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;And do not touch what is unclean; And I will welcome you.&nbsp; 18 &ldquo;And I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and daughters to Me,&rdquo; Says the Lord Almighty</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Based on his comments about Catholicism, Warren knows that the Catholic church has a false gospel.&nbsp; Rather than calling for unity with unbelievers, Warren needs to recant.&nbsp; He is the pastor of one of the largest churches in the country, and has national influence through his books, television appearances and speaking engagements.&nbsp; His comments about unity with the Catholic church could lead believers astray, and he needs to take this seriously, especially as a teacher and pastor.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more</em>.&rdquo; (Luke 12:48)</p>"

The Bible incorporates references to&nbsp;shepherds caring for&nbsp;sheep perhaps more than any other metaphor or picture of our relationship with the Lord. Psalm 23 is probably the best known example:</p>\n\n<h6>Psa. 23:1 The LORD is my shepherd,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I shall not want.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Psa. 23:2&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;He makes me lie down in green pastures.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">He leads me beside quiet waters.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Shepherds in ancient Israel were (and still are)&nbsp;humble young&nbsp;men who toil&nbsp;quietly caring for flocks in lonely places. Despite their unassuming qualities, shepherds were subject to scorn by some&nbsp;(e.g., in ancient Egypt; <em>see Genesis 46:34</em>)&nbsp;and were never celebrated&nbsp;even in Israel. It&#39;s easy to take a shepherd for granted.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Nevertheless,&nbsp;the Bible elevates shepherds time and again as honorable and important servants of the people, and as such they became a useful picture in the Bible&nbsp;of Christ and the leaders in the church, who Paul calls shepherds in&nbsp;Acts 20:28. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It&#39;s particularly noteworthy that God&nbsp;counted shepherds worthy to be included among the first people to witness the arrival of our Messiah. In Luke&#39;s Gospel we read:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 2:8 &nbsp;In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 2:9 And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened.&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 2:10 But the angel said to them, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 2:11 for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 2:12 &ldquo;This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 2:13 And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 2:14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 2:15 &nbsp;When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another, &ldquo;Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 2:16 So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger.&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 2:17 When they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child.&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 2:18 And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 13px;\">Luke 2:19 But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 13px;\">Luke 2:20 The shepherds went back,&nbsp;glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We&#39;ve all heard the story before, and we&#39;re sung it many times in Christmas carols: shepherds visited in their fields at night by the angel delivering good news that the Messiah has arrived as promised by the prophets. Have you ever stopped to consider why the announcement of such an important event was delivered first to shepherds?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In fact, everything about the Lord&#39;s arrival was quiet and peaceful and unadorned. He was a Baby, not a conquering King. He was sleeping in a place intended for animals, not in a palace. His parents were anonymous, His hometown was ignominious (<em>John 1:46</em>), and His enemies were powerful (<em>Matthew 2:13-18</em>).&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It&#39;s easy to see a close connection between the Lord Himself and those God called upon first following His arrival. Rather&nbsp;than announce Christ&#39;s arrival&nbsp;in pomp and circumstances befitting a King, the Lord preferred to deliver Jesus in a manner befitting a shepherd: quiet, unassuming, isolated, surrounded by lowly&nbsp;animals and despised. As Isaiah foretold:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Is. 53:3&nbsp; He was despised and forsaken of men,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And like one from whom men hide their face.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, when the Lord assigned&nbsp;others the priviledge of heralding Christ&#39;s arrival, He selected a group that perfectly represented the Messiah&#39;s own ministry of service to God&#39;s flock. Notice in Luke 2:17 that after learning of the Messiah&#39;s birth and vistiing Him in person, the shepherds leave to \"make known\" everything they had experienced. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Who were they telling? Shepherds normally spent their time in the fields alone, but because of&nbsp;their excitement these shepherds came in from the fields and went into the towns and villages&nbsp;proclaiming&nbsp;the good news to family, friends and probably strangers.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So why did the Father orchestrate the arrivals of His Son into the world in such a curious manner?&nbsp;</span>Jesus entered the world in a humble way to match&nbsp;His purpose in coming: to save those who humbled themselves and believed in Him.&nbsp;So Jesus came gently, like those He purposed to save.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Father still intended for His Son&#39;s arrival to cause a stir and to bring attention to this miraculous moment, so He called upon equally lowly and humble servants to carry that message to the world. These men became His first witnesses, just as humble Jesus became the First Fruits of the Resurrection.</p>\n\n<p>Notice the impact the shepherds had upon the people who heard their proclamations. In v.18&nbsp;Luke records that the people wondered about the things they heard from the shepherds. The Greek word wonder means to be amazed and astonished by the news of the shepherds. Even though they were lowly shepherds, the news they brought was wondrous and welcome. It&#39;s not the messenger; it&#39;s the message!</p>\n\n<p>Not much has changed in 2,000+ years. The good news of Christ&#39;s arrival is <em>still</em> good news. Jesus is still calling the world to know Him and follow Him. And the Lord is still calling humble, lowly servants to leave our stations in life so we may proclaim what we have heard and experienced to our family, friends and even strangers. We proclaim a Savior born in Bethlehem, and we call the world to accept Him as Lord. We may not be impressive messengers, but we deliver a message&nbsp;of unequalled power (1Cor 2:1-2).</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s be like the shepherds of that first Christmas. Let&#39;s engage someone&nbsp;this week in a conversation about the Messiah and the reason we celebrate His arrival.</p>\n\n<p>Merry Christmas!</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Steve_Sig008.jpg\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 55px;\" /></p>"

For example, most people don&rsquo;t know how hot dogs are made.&nbsp; If they did, there&rsquo;d be a lot more people who didn&rsquo;t eat hot dogs.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, most of us don&rsquo;t come into contact with someone having an abortion.&nbsp; Despite the fact that there were 1,060,000 abortions in the U.S. in 2011 (the latest figures from the Guttmacher Institute), most of us live our lives completely unaware that over a million babies are murdered every single year right here in our own back yard.&nbsp; Compare this to the fact that there were 13,716 murders in the U.S. in 2013, according to the FBI.&nbsp; Surely, we&rsquo;d act differently if every night the news reported that there were 2,900 people murdered today.&nbsp;

Some think it&rsquo;s okay to murder one&rsquo;s child up to age 4 or 5, simply because they are not yet &ldquo;self aware&rdquo;, whatever that means.&nbsp; This is infanticide, pure and simple.</p>\n\n<p>In an article by <em>The College Fix</em>, they report on college student abortion viewpoints gleaned from interviews, and the results are chilling.&nbsp; Kristina Garza, spokeswoman for Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust, a pro-life organization, said, &ldquo;For those who are firmly for abortion, because they understand it kills a human being, it&rsquo;s very easy for them to accept killing a human being after birth.&nbsp; There is this notion that is common on campus, that it&rsquo;s OK to kill babies because somehow we don&rsquo;t become human until we are self aware.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Why is this happening?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s due in part to college students being taught that this is okay.&nbsp; One of the early proponents of murdering babies outside the womb is Peter Singer, who is, ironically, an &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; professor at Princeton University.&nbsp; As long ago as 1979, Singer wrote, &ldquo;Human babies are not born self-aware, or capable of grasping that they exist over time. &nbsp;They are not persons&rdquo;; therefore, &ldquo;the life of a newborn is of less value than the life of a pig, a dog, or a chimpanzee.&rdquo;&nbsp; College professors are having their students read this type of garbage, from Singer and others.&nbsp; As a result, the view that murdering one&rsquo;s baby outside the womb is growing among college students.</p>\n\n<p>You might think, just because they&rsquo;re being taught this doesn&rsquo;t mean they should accept it, and you&rsquo;d be correct.&nbsp; However, I think one of the main reasons why college students accept this (and even why it&rsquo;s being taught) is due to the crumbling of morality in the U.S.&nbsp; Churches, by and large, do not clearly teach the word of God.&nbsp; Instead, churches have catered to the culture so as to be &ldquo;relevant&rdquo;, so they can increase their membership.&nbsp; While we shouldn&rsquo;t expect the world to be moral, Christians who are not growing in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ are simply going to be more susceptible to such views.&nbsp; Thus, when Christians do see such evil, they tend to accept it because the world accepts it.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the world does not like hearing about other people&rsquo;s morals.&nbsp; Indeed, a member of a pro-abortion organization put it this way:&nbsp; &ldquo;As for post-birth abortion, I would imagine that my colleagues would think the &lsquo;post-birth&rsquo; part was largely irrelevant, as we believe very strongly in abortion on demand, without apology, and it&rsquo;s plain and simple that we should look to the woman&rsquo;s morals and not shove our opinions where they, frankly, don&rsquo;t belong,&rdquo; said Devin Deitsch, leader of VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood at Ohio State University.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if this same person was assaulted and robbed of his belongings, I&rsquo;m quite certain imposing our morals on the robber would very quickly come into play.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why we have laws, because robbing someone is wrong, and that&rsquo;s a moral statement.&nbsp; Somehow, though, murdering babies doesn&rsquo;t merit such morality.</p>\n\n<p>As Christians, we should not be surprised by unbelievers&rsquo; views.&nbsp; Romans 1 plainly tells us why we see things such as this:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>28 And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, 29 being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; 32 and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>While it&rsquo;s obvious that abortion is murder and that it&rsquo;s inherently wrong, perhaps what drives many to support abortion is the desire to have unbridled sex without any responsibility.&nbsp; Did you get your girlfriend pregnant, and now you have to become a dad, taking care of your wife and baby?&nbsp; Have an abortion instead.&nbsp; Why take on such responsibility, when a simple abortion solves the problem, and allows you to continue in your immoral lifestyle?&nbsp; Of course, this is not how the pro-abortion movement puts it; rather, they paint this as a &ldquo;woman&rsquo;s choice&rdquo;, and who are you to say it&rsquo;s wrong?</p>\n\n<p>So, as Christians, what can we do to stem this tide?&nbsp; First and foremost, pray that the Lord would cause the law to be changed so that abortion would rightly be considered murder, no matter what the age of the baby, in or out of the womb.&nbsp; Laws can never legislate morality, and that is not why we have them.&nbsp; Laws are meant to protect people by punishing those who seek to harm others, especially those who cannot protect themselves.&nbsp; Abortion fits this description well, because an unborn baby is the most defenseless human being there is.</p>\n\n<p>Second, preach the gospel.&nbsp; As mentioned, laws can&rsquo;t cause one to be moral, including the Mosaic Law.&nbsp; The only thing that can cause a person to be moral is to be born again from above.&nbsp; Only by believing in Jesus is anyone going to change their morality.&nbsp; It happens on the inside, by the power of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; And of course, this only happens by the hearing of the word.&nbsp; As Romans 10 says, &ldquo;<em>9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; 10 for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.&nbsp; 11 For the Scripture says, &ldquo;Whoever believes in Him will not be disappointed.&rdquo;&hellip; 17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, preach the gospel to misguided college students, to pregnant women considering abortion, and to those who are pro-choice.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we can support pro-life organizations.&nbsp; Most of them work to change the law to restrict the ability of a woman to have an abortion.&nbsp; Such laws help reduce abortions until the law is changed to make abortion murder.&nbsp; I recommend supporting those who combine their work with the preaching of the gospel.</p>\n\n<p>About 2,900 babies were murdered in the U.S. today.&nbsp; Remember that.&nbsp; Pray, preach the gospel, support pro-life organizations.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s not allow murderous abortion to remain out of sight, out of mind.&nbsp; Even so, come Lord Jesus!</p>"

                 "body": "<p>Recently, I saw an irreverent bumper sticker that read: <em>Jesus saves...you should invest.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p>Overlooking the disrespectful tone, I was struck by the unintended Biblical truth of this statement:&nbsp;<em>Jesus saved us, so we are free to invest in eternity.</em></p>\n\n<p>Many of us know the frustration of struggling financially, working hard in our jobs yet falling further behind financially. Living paycheck-to-paycheck leaves no room for emergency expenses, leading many to borrow to cover the shortfall. When we have no time or money to invest in our future, we stand little chance of improving our circumstances. We&#39;re so burdened by yesterday&#39;s obligations that we can&#39;t consider tomorrow&#39;s opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>This same pattern holds true in our relationship to God. Before we knew the Lord and were saved by our faith in Christ, we were living paycheck-to-paycheck, spirtually speaking. Like all unbelievers, we assumed we could earn our entrance into Heaven (assuming we gave any thought to our eternal destiny).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our spiritual life was entirely focused on the here and now, trying to atone for our sin and improve our \"karma\" by performing \"good works\" for God. Inevitably, we slipped up or gave into temptation, our \"debt\" increased again, and we set back our spiritual progress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This hand-to-mouth approach to earning spiritual credit never gave us an assurance of salvation, because each day brought new failures, more guilt and the ever-present fear of coming up short on our judgment day. Certainly, investing in&nbsp;eternity was never a consideration; we were too busy paying off our debts.</p>\n\n<p>Now consider how the Lord changed our spiritual finances. By living a sinless life and dying on the cross in our place, Jesus has completed all the work required to save us from the penalty of our sins.</p>\n\n<p>As Paul wrote:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 4:4 &nbsp;Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.<br />\nRom. 4:5 &nbsp;But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Our debt before God has been paid in full by the work of Christ on our behalf. Since our debt has been paid, we are no longer required to pay it ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if a rich uncle offered to pay all your bills and expenses - both today and forever in the future. How would such a gift change your focus in life? The time you previously used earning a living and paying those bills suddenly becomes available for other pursuits. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>LIkewise, when Jesus paid our sin debt on the cross, He freed us to use our time in pursuit of other spiritual goals.</p>\n\n<p>Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 6:20 &nbsp;For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Biblically speaking, Christians are expected to use their days on earth to invest in their spiritual future. We do not perform our good works to obtain or secure our salvation; Christ has already completed the work of securing our salvation on the cross. &nbsp;Therefore, we can invest our time in glorfying the Lord with our bodies and building up others in the Church.</p>\n\n<p>By these investments, we store up treasure for ourselvs in Heaven. Paul told Timothy to teach this very principle in the Church:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 6:18 &nbsp;Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,<br />\n1Tim. 6:19&nbsp; storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>We must seek to become rich in good works, for by these works we store up for ourselves a good foundation for the future. This foundation is our future life in eternity, the real life we should seek and build.</p>\n\n<p>Because Jesus saved us, we can invest in that future. Let&#39;s invest in that spiritual future together!</p>\n\n<p>(If you&#39;re interested in learning more about the Bible&#39;s teaching on investing for your spiritual future, please listen to parts 1 and 2 of <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_sovereignty_of_god/the_love_of_money_part_1/\"><strong>The Love of Money</strong></a>, from our teaching series on the <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_sovereignty_of_god/\"><strong>Sovereignty of God</strong></a>.)</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~I&rsquo;ve always loved Christmas. Of course. Who doesn&rsquo;t, at least in theory? Christmas was always one thing that was done right in my house as I was growing up, and it didn&rsquo;t matter if we got underwear and socks as long as they were wrapped separately and stacked in piles under the Christmas tree as if abundance flowed. That lead in might make you think that this is going to be a tongue lashing, finger-wagging flap of scold about the materialism of Christmas, but it&rsquo;s not. Hang tight.</p>\n\n<p>When my son was born, I was determined to make the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; Christmas. In truth, I had struggled through the eight previous years of my marriage to get my husband to engage in some Christmas spirit to no avail. If I gave him a list of gift ideas&hellip;he bought everything on the list. If we bought a tree&hellip;I decorated it (he grumbled through the process). I gave Christmas my best efforts while he resigned himself to the madness. When my son arrived, I was convinced that Chris would come around to the excitement, and for several years, he rose to the occasion. Then, suddenly, I had two boys on my hands. Boys who, when faced with shopping under the stars for a fresh cut tree, could only focus on how blessed cold it was, what a pain it was going to be to get the tree home and through the door, and what a mess it was going to make when we finally had to drag the fire-hazard out again. That was the year I died a little inside over Christmas and bought an artificial tree.</p>\n\n<p>Never fear! There was still Santa and his reindeer to feed. And I decorated. Oh, how I decorated. And we rolled out the sorriest sugar cookies you&rsquo;ve ever seen. And we read all the best holiday books, and kept the Christmas story going through the Advent in perpetuity. Traditions forced on the family requiring mandatory gratitude for every bough of holly and every sugar sprinkle. I have the scrapbook pages to prove it all.</p>\n\n<p>Then we moved to Arkansas and we were closer to family, which only fed my Christmas fervor. I was determined to entertain. I hoped also to be invited to warm cozy Hallmark family gatherings around a glowing fire while Bing sang on the ol&rsquo; Victrola. Or some such craziness. It didn&rsquo;t work out quite that way, and a little bit more of me died inside over Christmas.</p>\n\n<p>One year, not too long ago, I decided to open my home for a portion of my church&rsquo;s Christmas progressive dinner. For weeks, this fed my Christmas fire. I planned. I purchased. I decorated with a fury. I spent hours looking for and choosing the perfect &ldquo;table-scape&rdquo;. I scoured my collectible 1950s Betty Crocker cookbooks for traditional dishes that would impress even the most jaded of Christmas Scrooges, should any enter my oh-so-Christmas-cheery home. All I can say is that the boys were glad I had something besides them to focus on!</p>\n\n<p>Then came the realization. I didn&rsquo;t know why I was doing all this. Every year. I was exhausted. I was exhausted from trying to achieve the perfect holiday season. I was exhausted by decorating for people who didn&rsquo;t care if I did it or not (and for imaginary people who never came to visit!). I was exhausted by cooking all the right dishes for men who would eat chili on any given day and be happy for it. I was exhausted by trying to live up to Martha&rsquo;s, Betty&rsquo;s, and Hallmark&rsquo;s demands! I was exhausted by my <em><strong>own </strong></em>expectations &ndash; because no one else cared! I was exhausted by trying to make everyone line up, look right, smile, participate, get with the Christmas program, and be merry and bright! Dang it!</p>\n\n<p>So I threw in the towel.</p>\n\n<p>A few years ago, I asked myself what I really love about Christmas. Then I asked my boys. And then we did those things. And we did not give one hoot what anyone else thought about them. Our decisions have raised some eyebrows, but peace is restored to my home through the holidays and now bliss reigns. I won&rsquo;t say that I don&rsquo;t look forward to my grandkids when we can re-visit some of the traditions of childhood. But for now I can tell you that letting go of all the traditions and expectations, and pride that come gift wrapped with the arrival of December first, have freed me to enjoy what <em><strong>is</strong></em>&hellip;not mourn over the failures of what-could-have-been.</p>\n\n<p>As you consider what I&rsquo;ve just written, let me ask you this. What <em><strong>exactly</strong></em> is different about this time of year from any other time of year? Really think about it. Name the thing, if you can. I&rsquo;m not asking you to give the Sunday school answer, because that doesn&rsquo;t fly either (Jesus wasn&rsquo;t born in December. Consider that bubble burst.). Christmas is a period of time marked out on the calendar, and distinguished by the <em><strong>activity</strong></em> we pursue during that time. That is all. If you stopped the activity that the calendar demands you pursue, the Christmas season would return to what it is: days on a calendar. Nothing more. So ask yourself. Why? Why do you do what you do at Christmas?</p>\n\n<p>I know my own answers, and I face them again every year. Every Christmas season now, I ask myself what is real, what is important, what is honest and sincere, and what is of true value and lasting worth. And I examine my motives. Is pride driving me? Is competition driving me? Am I seeking affirmation, personal fulfillment, or praise? Am I trying to meet someone else&rsquo;s expectations? Then I unapologetically eliminate the things that would master me to no good end, and I am free do what I truly <em><strong>want </strong></em>to do, motivated only by the purest joy available to me while still trapped in this flesh. The result is my heart&rsquo;s version of Christmas pared down to the essential core. And it&rsquo;s really no different from any other day on the calendar. That&rsquo;s the irony.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve had to consider. If I am generous at Christmas, why not the rest of the year? If I am hospitable at Christmas, why not the rest of the year? If I am cheerful at Christmas, why not the rest of the year? If I make a point to visit my family, my neighbors, my elderly in the nursing home at Christmas, why not the rest of the year? Conversely, if I don&rsquo;t bake 42 types of cookies to eat during one week at any other time of the year, why do I do that at Christmas? If I am careful with my budget 11 months of the year, why do I spend more than my mortgage chasing materialism at Christmas? Why should the date on the calendar determine the number of days during which I live a life that honors Christ? It shouldn&rsquo;t. And that makes Christmas look a little bit different.</p>\n\n<p>I think Christmas deserves a second thought, and our traditions a thorough examination. Perhaps your family too would thank you for giving up some of those greeting card, White Christmas expectations you have a choke-hold on. Or maybe you should consider applying those ideologies throughout the rest of the year rather than cramming them into a scant few weeks. Has the calendar become your Master, giving you orders that you don&rsquo;t question, even if that marches your family to the brink of destruction? Maybe it&rsquo;s time for you and your family to ask the question, &ldquo;What really matters to us about Christmas?&rdquo; Consider listening to the answer. You may find that, as a result, the Christmas spirit will go with you into every other day, along with the joy that&rsquo;s supposed to accompany it. You might be surprised to find that in letting go of much, you gain much much more.</p>\n\n<p>Merry Christmas, everyone! May it be your most honest Christmas ever!</p>\n\n<p>ps&hellip;Just because I know you&rsquo;re curious, I&rsquo;ll give you a hint about one of the things we do &ldquo;different&rdquo; at Christmas now. Although we like turkey and all the trimmings just fine, we love lasagna! *wink*</p>"

This is because of the tremendous increase in the number of seismograph stations in the world and the many improvements in global communications. In 1931, there were about 350 stations operating in the world; today, there are more than 8,000 stations and the data now comes in rapidly from these stations by electronic mail, internet and satellite. This increase in the number of stations and the more timely receipt of data has allowed us and other seismological centers to locate earthquakes more rapidly and to locate many small earthquakes which were undetected in earlier years. The NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year or approximately 50 per day. Also, because of the improvements in communications and the increased interest in the environment and natural disasters, the public now learns about more earthquakes.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to long-term records (since about 1900), we expect about 17 major earthquakes (7.0 - 7.9) and one great earthquake (8.0 or above) in any given year.</h6>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"quote\">So... earthquakes <em><strong>aren&#39;t </strong></em>getting any more frequent or any more severe.</p>\n\n<p>On that particular point, it appears that World Net Daily and the good pastor&nbsp;miss the mark.&nbsp; What about all the other factors?&nbsp; Well... those are a topic for a different article.</p>\n\n<p>For now, let us remain serious and sober awaiting the Lord&#39;s return and remember Paul&#39;s exhortation to Timothy:</p>\n\n<h6>I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which He will bring about at the proper time &mdash; He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see.

                 "body": "<p>On this Thanksgiving Day many families gather with loved ones, blood-related or not, around an embarrassingly bountiful table. And before digging into those first bites of the feast, thanks will be given. Thanks will be given to God for everything He has given us, for the bounty of our harvest. And even though our modern-day harvest may be very different from that of the legendary pilgrims quintessentially associated with this holiday, we will thank God for all He gives us: health, jobs, comfort, wealth, freedom, loved ones, time, life. On this day, even many unbelievers will feel the need to &ldquo;say grace&rdquo; and thank God for everything they&rsquo;ve been given.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I love a driving contemporary beat as much as anyone, but sometimes it takes a good old hymn to chisel through to the core. This past Sunday we sang <em>Come, Ye Thankful People, Come</em>, a hymn written By Henry Alford in the 1800s.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Come, Ye Thankful People, Come&mdash;<br />\nRaise the song of harvest home:<br />\nAll is safely gathered in<br />\nEre the winter storms begin.<br />\nGod, our Maker, doth provide<br />\nFor our wants to be supplied:<br />\nCome to God&rsquo;s own temple, come&mdash;<br />\nRaise the song of harvest home.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Henry encourages us to gather and thank the Lord for all He has given, to celebrate God&rsquo;s provision, appropriately on a holiday that falls at the end of the harvest, typically right after the first frost, when all has been safely gathered in. It marks the time when toils are done and the bounty of the harvest is what will carry these people through the winter until the field can be worked again. A harvest feast&hellip;our harvest. Right?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>All the world is God&rsquo;s own field,<br />\nFruit unto His praise to yield;<br />\nWheat and tares together sown,<br />\nUnto joy or sorrow grown.<br />\nFirst the blade and then the ear,<br />\nThen the full corn shall appear;<br />\nLord of harvest, grant that we<br />\nWholesome grain and pure may be.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>For the Lord our God shall come<br />\nAnd shall take His harvest home;<br />\nFrom His field shall in that day<br />\nAll offenses purge away;<br />\nGive His angels charge at last<br />\nIn the fire the tares to cast,<br />\nBut the fruitful ears to store<br />\nIn His garner evermore.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>These verses are based on the parable found in Matthew&rsquo;s gospel:</p>\n\n<p>Matthew 13:24-30<br />\n24 Jesus presented another parable to them, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. 25 But while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away. 26 But when the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the tares became evident also. 27 The slaves of the landowner came and said to him, &lsquo;Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?&rsquo; 28 And he said to them, &lsquo;An enemy has done this!&rsquo; The slaves *said to him, &lsquo;Do you want us, then, to go and gather them up?&rsquo; 29 But he *said, &lsquo;No; for while you are gathering up the tares, you may uproot the wheat with them. 30 Allow both to grow together until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, &ldquo;First gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the wheat into my barn.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>And so it is that as we sit and thank God for the bounty of our harvest we forget that we ourselves are part of the Lord&rsquo;s harvest. Have you considered that the thanks from the unbeliever and that from the redeemed are vastly different? Just as we &ldquo;do not mourn as those who have no hope&rdquo; (1Thes. 4:13), we do not <strong>thank</strong> as those who have no hope. While some can only thank the Lord for the common grace of the temporal gifts we receive on earth, we can thank the Lord of the harvest for His <strong>saving</strong> grace that has seen fit for us to be counted among the wheat and not the tares. For some, the thanksgiving will end with their lives here on earth; for the believer the thanksgiving will be an activity continuing beyond death into eternity for the ultimate gift of everlasting life. You see, our thanksgiving feast has its roots on an earlier feast of thanksgiving:</p>\n\n<p>Luke 22:19<br />\n&ldquo;And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Lord Jesus, knowing that He was hours away from being betrayed, hours away from excruciating pain, torture, humiliation and death, saw fit to give thanks for the salvation that <strong>He</strong> was about to accomplish for each one of us. He left us with the promise that He would come back to gather His harvest.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Even so, Lord, quickly come<br />\nTo Thy final harvest home;<br />\nGather Thou Thy people in,<br />\nFree from sorrow, free from sin;<br />\nThere, forever purified,<br />\nIn Thy presence to abide:<br />\nCome, with all Thine angels, come&mdash;<br />\nRaise the glorious harvest home.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Amen.</strong></em></p>"

                 "body": "<p>I&rsquo;m headed home tomorrow. Home for Thanksgiving. There&rsquo;s no reason you should know that &ldquo;home&rdquo; for us is St. Louis: the suburbs in point of fact. My husband and I moved there straight out of college and spent 20 years there, adding my son to those who call themselves native St. Louisans.&nbsp; My husband grew up directly across the river on the Illinois side. So, yeah. Home.</p>\n\n<p>If our international readers will forgive me for bringing up a &ldquo;local&rdquo; issue I promise that in the end, you too will find merit in having hung in there.</p>\n\n<p>Watching the extended media coverage last night of the Michael Brown drama in Ferguson made it uncertain whether it was prudent to make the trip home, or if we would even be able to pass through, as we will skirt the fringe of Ferguson on our way across the river. We still plan to go, but with trepidation. And with fearful hearts. Hearts that&hellip;well&hellip; are heavy with dread. After I went to bed last night, I prayed through semi-wakefulness all night but the only words I could find were &ldquo;Help us, Lord.&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Bring peace, and justice to the evil-doers.&rdquo;&nbsp;I knew who those evil-doers were, and was certain He did as well. Imagine my surprise when I woke to find the Facebook post of a respected Christian voice who had prayed the same thing through the night, there at the throne side by side with me, pleading for peace, and justice for the evil doers&hellip;sure that the evil doers were on the <em><strong>other</strong></em> side.</p>\n\n<p>Let me back up a bit and confess that watching the coverage last night reduced me to rage. I ranted. I yelled at the television. I swore. I name-called. And between all that, I prayed in desperate helplessness and made demands of the Lord that He do something&hellip;why wouldn&rsquo;t He DO SOMETHING? This morning &ndash; today &ndash; I&rsquo;ve tried to talk it out with Him rationally and I think I understand some things now, the first being the gob-smacking realization that within me hides the same rage that burned Ferguson last night. Those are the things I want to talk with you about. Put on your big kid pants.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the Michael Brown report was initially a 3rd page, below the fold media story where you live, but stop for a minute and try to recall your first thought on hearing of the shooting. OK&hellip;so it&rsquo;s not JFK, but humor me. Did your first thought include a &ldquo;they&rdquo;? You know, &ldquo;Well, there &lsquo;they&rsquo; go again&hellip;&rdquo; Who was your &ldquo;they&rdquo;?</p>\n\n<p>This is your prejudice.</p>\n\n<p>Oh. You thought it was &ldquo;they&rdquo; who were prejudiced. Hm. Really?</p>\n\n<p>If you are alive and living in America (the world?) you have experienced prejudice, and have been guilty of it. It is inevitable. My white middle class son experiences the prejudice of not&nbsp;qualifying for scholarships because of the color of his skin. I have experienced prejudice in the corporate world where I was paid less for doing the same work as the men in my company. I&rsquo;ve experienced the sting of prejudice against the poor, and have felt the shame of it stain my thoughts from the other side of poverty. I&rsquo;m Christian&hellip;&rsquo;nuff said! I&rsquo;ve seen the effects of prejudice against the obese, the handicapped, the homosexual, the Muslim, the immigrant, the ugly, and I share the burden of many of those sins myself. Black, white, or purple, we all know prejudice. We all have prejudice. And we are all guilty for what is happening in Ferguson, Missouri.</p>\n\n<p>This morning, my overwhelming response to the pundits and expounders, the preachers and the media, the loud-mouths and the opinionated was: SHUT. UP. Just&hellip;shut up. And&nbsp;I actually think (perhaps with more gentleness and respect) it&rsquo;s the right message, one I would follow with a request that everyone, Christians most needfully, go look at themselves in the mirror to find the guilty party &ndash; the evil doer.</p>\n\n<p>While we discussed all of this with our son last night, we were careful to present every aspect of the case as we came to understand it, giving weight equally to both sides and helping him reason to his conclusion rather than jump on his group-text to rant with the unreasoned, uninformed, emotionally unrestrained youth he calls his peers! But what I failed to do in the haze of my own fury was entreat him to examine his heart and expose it to holy light until he unearthed his own prejudice and dealt with it. Because that&hellip;<em><strong>THAT</strong></em>&hellip; that is the solution to Ferguson. In short, the answer that everyone is looking for is this: shut up, go look in the mirror, deal with <em><strong>your</strong></em> sin before God. Then you will be able to teach unbelievers, and believers alike, how to look past prejudice; love past prejudice; pray past prejudice, and that is how to heal a community one soul at a time.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder how different we all would look stripped down to nothing but our soul. Without the trappings of our flesh, which causes us to sin so grievously against one another, would we all look essentially the same? Would it be impossible then to categorize us into appropriate boxes? Could we then see through the eyes of a white cop? Or a black teenager? Could we see through eyes blind to either one of those appearances? What if that? What if we began to presume that anything that exits within another man is within us as well, in spite of the outer trappings. In other words, what if we began to think of ourselves as equals: sinners, reprobates, thieves, and murderers&hellip;guilty. Guilty. Guilty. All needful of the grace and mercy and salvation of a holy God.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In St. Louis, there exists a strange phenomenon that locals find quaint, and helpful to the point of necessity. When you first meet a native St.Louisan, they will ask you, &ldquo;Where did you go to High School?&rdquo; I know, right? It&rsquo;s ridiculous. Who cares? <em><strong>They</strong></em> do. Because they have grown up in a culture and society that pigeon-holes and associates you with your community, and allows them to set themselves apart from the lesser-thans, the other-thans, the different-thans. It&rsquo;s true in both the black and the white communities, which have remained shamefully divided across decades of time. They will vehemently deny that this is why they ask, but it is the truth. The truth is also that <em><strong>nothing</strong></em> sets them apart. Nothing at all. We are sinners on the inside, every one of us, with only one grace to save.</p>\n\n<p>Post Script - I would entreat you to please add nothing to this conversation until you have well and truly plowed your own ground and unearthed the same potential inside yourself that you can so easily see in your &ldquo;they&rdquo;. When you can stand shoulder to shoulder with &ldquo;them&rdquo; pleading for mercy, then you can contribute something needful to the discussion. Until then, pray. Pray for yourself. Pray for Ferguson.&nbsp;Pray for the innoncent, and pray for the guilty. Pray that the true evil doer will not succeed in his schemes! Pray for the souls of the lost...and the found. Pray. Without ceasing. Pray.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>By Jerry Dyke</p>\n\n<p>I have been studying through the book of Matthew recently, and this past week finished chapter nine which ends with these verses, &ldquo;Seeing the people, He felt compassion for&nbsp;them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd. &nbsp;Then He said to His disciples, &lsquo;The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore&nbsp;beseech the Lord of harvest to send out workers into the harvest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Verses like these have always been compelling to me as I taught them in Sunday school or read through them in my personal Bible study, but the significance of this passage&nbsp;has now taken on new meaning in my life as I transition out of a corporate environment into full-time ministry. &nbsp;The weight of these verses has literally overwhelmed me as I&nbsp;considered the responsibility implied and have wondered whether or not I am really up to the task.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I read the first part of chapter 10 of Matthew and realized that the people Jesus selected as His disciples, the ones with whom He would entrust to implement His plan to&nbsp;usher in His kingdom, were pretty ordinary men. &nbsp;In fact, throughout the entire Bible, we see that God used ordinary men and women with a lot of character flaws, untrained,&nbsp;unqualified, uncertain, just like me and you to do extraordinary things for His kingdom which gives me hope and the confidence that God is sovereign and will use me for His&nbsp;glory as I surrender to His will.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s with this understanding that I reapply, personally, the application of Hebrews 12:1-2, &ldquo;Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay&nbsp;aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and&nbsp;perfector of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\"</p>\n\n<p>Thank you, Jesus, for choosing me. &nbsp;Thank you for giving me the privilege of serving you. &nbsp;Thank you for giving me your Holy Spirit to empower me to do your work. &nbsp;Help me to&nbsp;faithfully follow you wherever you lead me.

                 "body": "<p>~~The &ldquo;Directional Leader&rdquo; of my church used to be a worship leader. He has the most heavenly voice that God ever ushered forth from a human being. Truly. I could listen to him and do nothing else until Jesus comes again and I&rsquo;m quite sure I would be completely fulfilled going into eternity. Because we have rotating teaching pastors and worship leaders in my church, he sometimes leads our worship time. Today was that day and I wanted to just shush everyone in the auditorium and say, &ldquo;Let him sing!&rdquo; especially when the lady behind me opened her mouth to contribute her best effort at carrying a tune.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThere I was caught between the echoes of heaven and, well, like I said, her best effort. &lsquo;Really&rsquo;, I tried to convince myself, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s only slightly off key&rsquo;. And then came that familiar voice, which asked, &ldquo;Kind of like your worship, Melissa?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Uh huh. Kind of like that.</p>\n\n<p>I won&rsquo;t presume that this applies to anyone but me, but just in case you can relate, here&rsquo;s what happens to me on a Sunday morning. I get up like always and try to decide what to wear that will make just the right impression &ndash; like I didn&rsquo;t try too hard, but I&rsquo;m just naturally this stylish every day. (You hear the sarcasm, right?) Then I saunter into church comparing how I did with how everyone else did. I have to sit in a row close to the front because I am easily distracted by the iPhones alight around me, the girl playing with her hair, the man jingling his change, the hipster casually sipping his Starbucks. I stand singing with the rest of the congregation wondering if anyone has noticed that I don&rsquo;t need to look at the jumbo-tron to see the words &ndash; I got this. I may close my eyes if I feel especially moved, but then begin to wonder if anyone thinks I&rsquo;ve gone to sleep, especially when they have to nudge me to take the offering plate. I take notes during the sermon and angle my bible just right so that the guy next to me can see how studious I am by how marked up my book is. And when I leave church I am piously, quietly considering the message while others chit-chat about their lunch dates as if nothing at all has just transpired.</p>\n\n<p>Blessed assurance! This is worship? Well, maybe it&rsquo;s worship slightly off key. If I am gentle with myself and honest with you I have to admit that although all these things are true (you can judge me later&hellip;focus for a minute) my heart for the Lord is also just as true. I love worship time. I love the Lord. I love to praise Him and lift my hands to Him, offering all that I have and all that I am. I love to learn, and to know Him better and to be better equipped to serve Him because of having been in His house. I just lack the ability to do any of that without self-awareness for any length of time. Before you know it, my mind is recalled from the throne of glory to the mirror of my mind&rsquo;s eye and I&rsquo;m thinking about me again. (Or drafting this article in my head.)&nbsp; Back and forth I go, without the discipline to maintain concentrated attention where it belongs: on my Savior. The desire is there, but my effort is slightly skewed and it rings discordant with His song. I&rsquo;m just slightly off key.</p>\n\n<p>This malady carries over to every part of a Christian life if we are not careful. We drop the oh-so-casual comment about serving the blind, lame, and homeless&nbsp;on Thanksgiving Day, having eschewed our own creature comforts. Or we compare Samaritan Purse boxes&hellip;how many, how much, and what exactly went in. We happen to mention our unavailability on any given Wednesday morning because we are committed to our Bible study. We stretch a yawn into an explanation of how early we rose that day to meet the Lord. Or we exalt in our evangelism efforts and successes on our FB feed: which mission trip we&rsquo;re saving for, or how many we&rsquo;ve been on and how many spring breaks we&rsquo;ve given up to serve the poor. They&rsquo;re just a casual reminder to others that we&rsquo;re doing alright. Now, there is certainly nothing wrong with working, serving, sacrificing, giving, studying, or evangelizing, but it&rsquo;s the need to prove something to someone that makes it like singing slightly off key. It&rsquo;s grating and dissonant. It&rsquo;s slightly embarrassing for the people around us. It ruins the effect of the song and robs the audience (of One!) of pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>There I stood today, singing quite well, thank you very much and yet striking an ugly chord. And there she was, the lady behind me, singing in shocking dissonance but with&nbsp;effortless&nbsp;self-abandon to sincere worship that was a lovely offering to the Lord. I ask you, which&nbsp;of us was making a joyful noise&nbsp;and which&nbsp;was signing slightly off key? Something to think about as we go through our day humming that worship chorus and wondering who might recognize the tune.</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The year was 1870, and it was the first Vatican council of the Catholic church.&nbsp; The meeting was to determine, in part, the primacy and the infallibility of the bishop of Rome (i.e., the pope).&nbsp; The main declaration of the council regarding papal infallibility reads as follows:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;we teach and define as a divinely revealed dogma that when the Roman pontiff speaks EX CATHEDRA, that is, when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole church, he possesses, by the divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, that infallibility which the divine Redeemer willed his church to enjoy in defining doctrine concerning faith or morals.&nbsp; Therefore, such definitions of the Roman pontiff are of themselves, and not by the consent of the church, irreformable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Effectively, this means if a pope declares something relating to &ldquo;faith or morals&rdquo;, it is an infallible declaration.&nbsp; Furthermore, ALL Catholics MUST believe what a pope infallibly states.&nbsp; The Canon Law of the Catholic church puts it this way:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Can. 752 Although not an assent of faith, a religious submission of the intellect and will must be given to a doctrine which the Supreme Pontiff or the college of bishops declares concerning faith or morals when they exercise the authentic magisterium, even if they do not intend to proclaim it by definitive act; therefore, the Christian faithful are to take care to avoid those things which do not agree with it.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Can. 753 Although the bishops who are in communion with the head and members of the college, whether individually or joined together in conferences of bishops or in particular councils, do not possess infallibility in teaching, they are authentic teachers and instructors of the faith for the Christian faithful entrusted to their care; the Christian faithful are bound to adhere with religious submission of mind to the authentic magisterium of their bishops.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Can. 754 All the Christian faithful are obliged to observe the constitutions and decrees which the legitimate authority of the Church issues in order to propose doctrine and to proscribe erroneous opinions, particularly those which the Roman Pontiff or the college of bishops puts forth.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fast forward 144 years to October, 2014.&nbsp; The pope is Francis, and, speaking to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, he made the following statement:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;When we read about Creation in Genesis, we run the risk of imagining God was a magician, with a magic wand able to do everything &mdash; but that is not so.&nbsp; He created human beings and let them develop according to the internal laws that he gave to each one so they would reach their fulfillment.&nbsp; He gave autonomy to the beings of the universe at the same time at which he assured them of his continuous presence, giving being to every reality, and so creation continued for centuries and centuries, millennia and millennia, until it became which we know today, precisely because God is not a demiurge or a magician, but the creator who gives being to all things.&nbsp; The Big Bang, which today we hold to be the origin of the world, does not contradict the intervention of the divine creator but, rather, requires it.&nbsp; Evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may not be immediately clear, but this is a statement regarding &ldquo;faith and morals&rdquo;, and, as such, it would mean it is an infallible statement.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is how it relates to faith and morals.&nbsp; The pope is effectively saying evolution is true, that it is consistent with creation.&nbsp; The problem is that evolution directly contradicts the creation account in Genesis.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genesis 2:15 says, &ldquo;<em>Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it.&nbsp; The LORD God commanded the man, saying, &ldquo;From any tree of the garden you may eat freely; but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die</em>.&rdquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This means that there was no death until Adam committed sin by disobeying the one command God gave him.&nbsp; This is also seen in Romans 6:23, which says, &ldquo;<em>For the wages of sin is death</em>&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since evolution teaches that there was death prior to man ever having evolved, it contradicts Scripture.&nbsp; God only gave a command to Adam.&nbsp; So, if evolution was true, there could not have been sin, and therefore no death, prior to Adam.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Going back to pope Francis&rsquo; statement, then, it&rsquo;s clear that his teaching that evolution is true is indeed a teaching on faith and morals.&nbsp; Since his teaching directly contradicts Scripture, pope Francis once again demonstrates papal fallibility.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, the pope&rsquo;s statement about God not being able to do everything that is stated in the Genesis account of creation also demonstrates that the pope does not believe what Scripture says.&nbsp; God is indeed able to do everything Scripture states in Genesis.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is, of course, not the first time that supposedly infallible popes made fallible statements regarding faith and morals.&nbsp; For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Catholic church condemned pope Honorius I for teaching the monothelite heresy.</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pope Liberius defended the heresy of Arianism.</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pope Boniface taught that the ark of Noah was a picture of the church, while in fact it is a picture of Christ (1 Peter 3).</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pope Sixtus re-wrote the Bible, which was filled with errors; a later pope tried to buy back those Bibles that were in circulation and re-issued another Bible to correct the errors.</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pope Boniface VIII infallibly declared &ldquo;Furthermore, we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet the second Vatican council (also &ldquo;infallible&rdquo;) said, &ldquo;The Church recognizes that in many ways she is linked with those who, being baptized, are honored with the name of Christian, though they do not profess the faith in its entirety or <strong>do not preserve unity of communion with the successor of Peter</strong>. &nbsp;For there are many who honor Sacred Scripture, taking it as a norm of belief and a pattern of life, and who show a sincere zeal. &nbsp;They lovingly believe in God the Father Almighty and in Christ, the Son of God and Saviour. &nbsp;They are consecrated by baptism, in which they are united with Christ.&rdquo; (my emphasis added)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are other fallible statements made by supposedly infallible popes, but you get the picture.&nbsp; Catholics typically try to defend these errors by saying that the pope is infallible only when he speaks &ldquo;ex cathedra&rdquo; (i.e., from the seat, from the teaching seat as the pope).&nbsp; Yet, ex cathedra is conveniently not defined.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, Catholics disagree about exactly what it means.&nbsp; As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, since the pope did not infallibly define ex cathedra, then when a pope speaks about anything related to &ldquo;faith and morals&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s fair to say it must be infallible.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Catholic church is a false church because it has a false gospel.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no surprise, then, to see yet another pope demonstrate the errors and contradictions of this false church.&nbsp; I grew up in the Catholic church, and by God&rsquo;s grace, He brought me out of darkness and into His marvelous light.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s use the pope&rsquo;s recent statements as an opportunity to engage Catholics, and share the true gospel of Christ with them so they, too, might experience the grace of God that He has given to us who believe.</p>"

It&rsquo;s a time I look forward to all year and often the only time I see some of my family. I think it&rsquo;s safe to say, most of us know where we will spend this Thanksgiving and probably even Christmas. But, that&rsquo;s not the case for everyone. What about the 25,000 children who age out of foster care and are now on their own? No family. No home. No job. Twenty-five percent will become homeless. Fifty-six percent enter the unemployment ranks. Twenty-seven percent will end up in jail.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/African_Orphan.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 215px; margin: 5px 10px; float: right; \" /></p>\n\n<p>There are an estimated 153 million orphans worldwide. More than 107,000 children are waiting to be adopted from the US foster care system. These numbers are devastating and yet inescapable. I hate to admit I&rsquo;ve found myself throwing out flyers in the mail without reading about the children on the front. I see commercials about giving just $5 a day and yet I turn the channel, claiming it&rsquo;s too emotional to watch. Our hearts hurt for these children, but often it&rsquo;s easier to look the other way. The feeling of helplessness can be overwhelming. Suddenly we feel so small in a world filled with endless need. But, each time we look away&hellip;each time we turn the channel and hope someone else takes action&hellip;a child is forgotten. We become increasingly numb to the depravity of our world and its victims of injustice.&nbsp; In doing so, we often do nothing.<br />\n<br />\nAs followers of Christ, we are all called to action. God does not want admirers. He wants followers. And if we follow Christ, we will be lead to the children. Psalm 10:14 says,</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted; you consider their grief and take it in hand. The victims commit themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>God doesn&rsquo;t look away. He doesn&rsquo;t forget.<br />\n<br class=\"Apple-interchange-newline\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Nepal_Orphan_Small.JPG\" style=\"width: 225px; height: 300px; margin: 5px 10px; float: left; \" />November is National Adoption month and a great time to be reminded of God&rsquo;s heart for orphans. God did not leave us as orphans. He came for us. How can we follow in His footsteps? Some of us are called to adopt or foster children. Some of us called to walk along side adoptive and foster families. Some of us are called to serve in global missions and orphanage outreach. Others are called to prayer and financial support. It only takes one compassionate individual to make a difference in the life of an orphan.</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.&rdquo; Psalm 82:3<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>We cannot defend the fatherless if we look the other way. Seek them. Find them. Love them. Pray for them. God found us and if we follow Him, He will lead us to the children. As you enjoy your Thanksgiving dinner, maybe set an extra plate at the table as a reminder of the children around the world who dream of sitting there with you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let them be forgotten.

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is a video of Victoria Osteen currently making the rounds.&nbsp; Perhaps you&rsquo;ve seen it; maybe you even saw the original broadcast.&nbsp; In the video, Osteen makes some outrageous claims.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so outrageous, you really need to hear it for yourself (click on video below).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLWm48fhCGQ\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLWm48fhCGQ</a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, you heard that right:&nbsp; when we obey God, we are not doing it for God; we are doing it for ourselves.&nbsp; God takes pleasure when we are happy.&nbsp; Do good &ldquo;for your own self&rdquo;.&nbsp; God wants us to be happy.&nbsp; When we worship God we are not doing it for God, we are doing it for ourselves, because that makes God happy.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Really?&nbsp; Like the Bereans, let&rsquo;s search the Scriptures to see if these things are so.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Someone may say, Proverbs 29:18 says, &ldquo;<em>Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained, But happy is he who keeps the law</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t this validate what Osteen says?&nbsp; No, because happiness is a result of obedience, but, as we&rsquo;ll see below, it is not the motivation to be obedient.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, what does Scripture say about our obeying God? Sometimes, obedience is tied to a conditional covenant, as in the Mosaic covenant.&nbsp; For example, Exodus 19 says, &ldquo;<em>3 Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain, saying, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel: 4 &lsquo;You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles&rsquo; wings, and brought you to Myself. 5 Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine; 6 and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.&rsquo; These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Did God require obedience so the Israelites could be &ldquo;happy&rdquo;?&nbsp; Did He tell Moses to tell the Israelites to obey for themselves, so He could be happy?&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; Obedience meant Israel would be blessed in that they would be God&rsquo;s own possession among all the peoples.&nbsp; This is the positive side of obedience.&nbsp; Now, they would surely be happy as a result of their obedience (as stated above), but God did not tell them to &ldquo;do it for your own self.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing about being happy here.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There&rsquo;s also a negative side to disobedience.&nbsp; That is, there is typically punishment or discipline for not obeying.&nbsp; Continuing with the Mosaic covenant, God says this is what will happen if Israel does not obey His commandments:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>15 But it shall come about, if you do not obey the Lord your God, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes with which I charge you today, that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you</em>&hellip;&rdquo; (Deuteronomy 28)&nbsp; If God just wants us to be happy, why punish or discipline us?&nbsp; We are to obey Him because He commands us to obey, and there are consequences for disobedience.&nbsp; No mention of being happy here, either.&nbsp; In fact, we are to be happy at such discipline:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves, So do not despise the discipline of the Almighty</em>.&rdquo; (Job 5:17)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We see a similar pattern in John 3:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>36 He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, obedience is equated with belief, while unbelief is disobedience.&nbsp; There is blessing (eternal life) for belief, and a curse (God&rsquo;s wrath) for unbelief.&nbsp; Again, nothing about being happy.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scripture equates obedience with love of God, not love of self.&nbsp; This is demonstrated in both the Old and the New Testaments.&nbsp; In the Old, the Mosaic covenant, the Law, is said to hang on two commandments, which Jesus explains in Matthew 22.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>36 &ldquo;Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?&rdquo; 37 And He said to him, &ldquo;&lsquo;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.&rsquo; 38 This is the great and foremost commandment. 39 The second is like it, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rsquo; 40 On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Obedience, then, would be due to love of God and neighbor, not self.&nbsp; When we love God, we seek to obey and glorify Him.&nbsp; Indeed, Scripture says, &ldquo;<em>Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God</em>.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 10:31)&nbsp; Thus our motivation to obey is out of love for God and a desire for Him to be glorified.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jesus echoes this same thing in John 14:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>15 If you love Me, you will keep My commandments</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ultimately, obedience is done out of love for God.&nbsp; Therefore, it stands to reason that when we obey Him, we actually <em>are</em> doing it for God, and not for ourselves.&nbsp; Therefore, Scripture completely contradicts Osteen&rsquo;s false teaching.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Second, what does Scripture say about our worshiping God?&nbsp; Do we also worship Him for our own self?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To &ldquo;worship&rdquo; means to bow down, revere someone, prostrate oneself, obey someone, with the idea that the someone is greater than you.&nbsp; For example, Psalm 95:6 says, &ldquo;<em>Come, let us worship and bow down, Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Similarly, Psalm 99:9 says, &ldquo;<em>Exalt the Lord our God And worship at His holy hill, For holy is the Lord our God</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We worship the Lord our God because He is holy, He is much, much greater than us, who are not holy (apart from Christ).&nbsp; Therefore, we give worship to God because He, and He alone, is worthy of our worship.&nbsp; Indeed, our Lord rebuked Satan by saying, &ldquo;<em>Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go, Satan! For it is written, &lsquo;You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Matthew 4:10)&nbsp; Never do we do it for our own self.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In fact, we are to offer our bodies to God as a living sacrifice.&nbsp; Romans 12:1 says, &ldquo;<em>Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship</em>.&rdquo; Often, that means doing things we&rsquo;d rather not do, instead of doing it for our own self.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what is meant by &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo;.&nbsp; We are to live for God, not for ourselves.&nbsp; Notice that we do this on His terms (&ldquo;acceptable to God&rdquo;), not on our own terms.&nbsp; Moreover, our service for God is actually a form of worship.&nbsp; To worship, as we saw earlier, is by definition putting someone above us, which means we do this for God, not for ourselves.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Beloved, Joel and Victoria Osteen are false teachers.&nbsp; They are not teaching the doctrines of God.&nbsp; Rather, they teach the doctrines of men.&nbsp; Isaiah prophesied about the Israelites teaching doctrines of men, as Jesus told the Pharisees:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>7 You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you:&nbsp; 8 &lsquo;This people honors Me with their lips, But their heart is far away from Me.&nbsp; 9 &lsquo;But in vain do they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the precepts of men</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; If you obey God for yourself, if you worship Him for yourself, you are following the precepts of men.&nbsp; Your heart is far from God, and your worship is in vain.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Osteens preach doctrines of demons.&nbsp; They preach what people want to hear, not what they need to hear.&nbsp; Scripture warns of such teachers in 2 Timothy 4:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, 4 and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Osteens are such teachers.&nbsp; They will tickle your ears, and will turn you from the truth of Scripture to myths.&nbsp; They will teach you to follow the desires of your flesh rather than to obey and worship God out of love for Him, even if that means we suffer in this life.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Paul suffered, and he was a living sacrifice for God.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. 7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; 8 in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing</em>.&rdquo; (2 Timothy)&nbsp; He did this out of love for God, for what Christ did for Him, and for us.&nbsp; May the Lord work in us to pour out our lives for Him out of love for Him, to fight the good fight and finish the course, and not live for ourselves.&nbsp; Do not listen the Osteen&rsquo;s teaching, but let us keep our eyes fixed on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, knowing there is a crown of righteousness laid up for us in heaven.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~On Sunday evening at eight o&rsquo;clock, just as we were all settling in for the evening, my son came into the living room and said, &ldquo;So&hellip;.&rdquo; , which is always an unnerving way to begin a conversation. He had just received a text from his video production teacher asking him to consider filling in for a team that had dropped out of a national film competition. He needed an answer immediately. Oh, and by the way, the deadline is Wednesday at 4 pm.&nbsp; 72 hours.&nbsp; To write, cast, shoot, and edit a 3-minute short (It doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but that&rsquo;s three times longer than the longest commercial you typically see on television). 72 hours. School days. Of course his immediate response was, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way!&rdquo; But we counseled him to think big-picture, and in spite of some really nasty complications and other major obligations, he agreed.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re now 2 hours and 24 minutes on the other side of his deadline, and I could not be more proud. And I&rsquo;ve learned something profound. See, while I&rsquo;m proud of the result of his effort, I&rsquo;m more proud of the effort itself. While I hope that his film finds favor with those who will be weighing and measuring it, I care less about the win, and more about what he gained in the process. It makes me wonder if we&rsquo;re profoundly missing the point when it comes to our own spiritual growth. Maybe the value is in the process, not the outcome. After all, the outcome is assured, and in fact, it&rsquo;s already complete in Christ, so why do we focus more on getting there than we do on what takes place along the way?</p>\n\n<p>Over the next couple of days, as Wil looks back over the experience, I want him to think about what he learned &ndash; about himself, about the work and how it suits him, about God&rsquo;s role in his success. I want to know what he would do differently, what was hard for him and what was easy, and how he could better equip himself for the next time. I want to know how he felt during the process and what he did with those feelings: how he managed them and pushed through them to focus on the work. I want to know what he thinks about himself and his character on the other side of this experience. I want him to think about these things. I want him to assimilate them into his own personal awareness until he really recognizes the man he sees in the mirror. Flaws, weaknesses, strengths&hellip;all of it&hellip;a pure reflection of the on-going the work of God.</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t you think this is what God wants too?</p>\n\n<p>I could go on here and talk about all the things that <em><strong>we</strong></em> saw as Wil made his way through this challenge, but that would be a waste of valuable white space, because what I really want you to take away is the stunning certainty that God is watching <em><strong>you</strong></em>. He&rsquo;s watching you struggle. And sometimes He&rsquo;s extraordinarily proud of the effort you&rsquo;re making and the fact that you agreed to do the work to begin with. And sometimes He&rsquo;s sad that you won&rsquo;t ask for help; He&rsquo;s waiting in the wings to provide whatever will move you forward, you need only ask. He&rsquo;s wondering what you&rsquo;re learning about yourself, and Him, and faith. He wants to know if you see your mistakes, and are determined to shore up weaknesses for next time. And He&rsquo;s waiting for the meltdown. Because He&rsquo;ll be there on the other side of the adrenaline rush, sheer panic, desperation, futility, hopefulness, certainty, and exhilaration to ask you the important question. Not, &ldquo;Did you win?&rdquo; but &ldquo;What did you learn?&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the process that matters. It&rsquo;s the <em><strong>process </strong></em>that makes us more like Christ.</p>\n\n<p>So the next time your text tone bings at you to issue a challenge, don&rsquo;t be too quick to say no. The next time God throws down the gauntlet, don&rsquo;t run. Take a leap into the unknown where there is risk of failure and humiliation, and just work the process until you come out on the other side saying, &ldquo;Huh! Didn&rsquo;t know I could do that.&rdquo; while God stands applauding.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>Halloween gets its names from All Hallows Evening, which is the night before All Hallows Day, a Catholic observance of all Christian martrys and other deceased believers. The word <em>hallows</em> means \"to make sacred\" (as in \"hallowed be His name...\"). The day was first declared a religious observance by the pope in AD 609 and later moved to its present date of November 1 by Pope Gregory IV in AD 835.</p>\n\n<p>Catholic myth and tradition shaped the practices of the holiday. Catholics were taught to pray on All Hallows Day for the souls of those Christians still suffering in purgatory, and during the Middle Ages poor children began a tradition of begging door to door on All Hallows seeking handouts in honor of the departed saints&#39; souls. William Shakespeare makes reference to this tradition in&nbsp;<em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona,</em>&nbsp;when a character in the play is accused of begging like someone on \"Hallowmas.\"</p>\n\n<p>The myths surrounding this day included a belief that the souls of the dead wander&nbsp;the earth each year until All Hallows&nbsp;seeking revenge against their enemies. Consequently, All Hallows Eve was thought to be the final night on earth for dead spirits to take their revenge.</p>\n\n<p>Tradition held that if a person was disguised on All Hallows Eve, he might escape the revenge of an angry soul, who could not find his target before departing the earth on All Hallows Day.&nbsp;Other traditions like burning candles and making jack-o-lanterns were directed at scaring away the avenging souls on that night.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">During the Protestant Reformation, the holiday was denounced by Protestant leaders</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;as ungodly and incompatible with biblical Christianity, but nevertheless the tradition persisted among many Christians. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In modern America the holiday has taken on new life as a night for parties, trick-or-treating, festivals, haunted houses and the like.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Next to Christmas, Halloween has become the most commercially successful holiday on the calendar.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Meanwhile,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">many churches have taken to using the night as a community outreach opportunity, with names like</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;\"Fall Festival\" or \"Harvest Celebration\" to distinguish the church celebration&nbsp;from a Halloween observance</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">.</span></p>\n\n<p>Given it&#39;s history and roots in pagan religion, the observance of&nbsp;Halloween has much to concern a born-again Christian.</p>\n\n<p>First, the holiday perpetuates false ideas, heresy and myth concerning the spirit world, life after death and the power of the dead.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly,&nbsp;the&nbsp;modern observance of Halloween remains closely associated with various occultic practices and celebrations, including real&nbsp;demonic activity, witchcraft, and sorcery. Though many see the day as little more than a excuse for candy and parties, the reality of demonic power and involvement in this day cannot be overstated. As Paul says,</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 6:12 &nbsp;For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Thirdly, our embracing of Halloween&#39;s imagery reinforces themes of darkness and evil that scripture warns a believer to set aside. Even a relatively \"innocent\" observance can promote a fascination with these themes among our children, leading them into deeper trouble in later years.</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, our participation in the holiday holds the potential to wound the conscience of new believers still wrestling with living out holiness and putting away sin.</p>\n\n<p>So given these concerns,&nbsp;may a Christian celebrate or observe Halloween?</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Should I celebrate Halloween?\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/halloween2(1).jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px; float: right; width: 275px; height: 325px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Clearly, Christians should consider carefully (and prayerfully) whether participating in Halloween is appropriate. We generally advise Christians against participating in Halloween for the reasons mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, our liberty in Christ gives us freedom to choose.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As a Bible teaching ministry, we bear a special responsibility to present the Biblical perspective on every issue rather than our personal opinions and convictions. We believe it would be inappropriate for us to pronounce something to be wrong in all cases for all Christians, unless the Bible itself declares this to be the truth. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, our ministry takes great care to emphasize the full measure of God&#39;s grace and the liberty made available to every believer in Christ.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Liberty in Christ means a believer&#39;s actions are no longer judged by laws written on stone but according to a law written on our hearts, guided by God&#39;s word and enforced by the Holy Spirit. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">When believers act according to the leading of the Spirit, in an attitude of love and with a heart to obey God&#39;s word, then they are walking in God&#39;s grace without condemnation and have liberty in many areas of life &ndash; and in some cases, liberty even to participate in activities that may have undesireable connotations or origins.</span></p>\n\n<p>In cases where Scripture is silent on specific activities or practices (like Halloween), our ministry determines if liberty is available by asking one simple question: is it possible for a Christian, under the leading of the Holy Spirit, to participate in some way without sinning?</p>\n\n<p>For example, could a Christian dress up as a clown (or other harmless character) and attend a costume party without sinning? Could a Christian walk around the neighborhood and stop at each home to ask for candy without sinning? Biblically speaking, these activities are not sins by themselves, and therefore we must conclude that a Christian has liberty to decide for himself whether and how to participate in Halloween. This kind of freedom is at the core of Paul&#39;s teaching in Colossians 2:16-17:</p>\n\n<h5>Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day - things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In this verse, Paul mentions that no one can sit in judgment over us regarding how we respond to \"festivals\" (which referred not only to the Jewish festivals but likely also included pagan celebrations like our Halloween). Paul taught those things hold no power over us, because they are merely shadows (symbols of power) for the one who has come to know God&#39;s true power in Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, a Christian <em>might</em> find opportunities to witness to unbelievers through participation in Halloween, at least to a degree.</p>\n\n<p>In Acts Chapter 16, Paul commands his young protege, Timothy, get circumcised before he participates in Paul&#39;s ministry to the Jews. Paul does this so that Timothy may be more acceptable to the Jewish culture where he would be bringing the Gospel message (v. 3). Elsewhere in Paul&#39;s epistles, Paul speci&#64257;cally directs that a believing Gentile should <em><strong>not</strong></em> undergo circumcision (1Cor 7:18).</p>\n\n<p>Why does Paul direct Timothy to be circumcised but then orders other men not be? The answer is that sometimes conforming to the unbelieving world in harmless ways can improve our chances to win them for Christ, while at other times our conforming may reduce our chances.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Timothy, submitting to circumcision made no difference in his relationship with Christ, yet it enhanced his opportunities to minister to the Jews. Consequently, Timothy wasn&#39;t wrong to practice circumcision given his intent to win Jews.&nbsp;On the other hand, Paul was ministering to a group in Corinth that was confused over whether circumcision was necessary for salvation, so to that group Paul prohibited the practice to make clear it was not required for salvation.</p>\n\n<p>The same thinking guides our understanding of Halloween or any worldly practice. In deciding whether to participate in Halloween, we let scriptures like Col 2:16 be our guide, while making our decisions based on the Spirit&#39;s leading. In all cases, we must give careful consideration to how our behaviors impact our Christian witness to our friends and neighbors, both believer and unbeliever alike.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we must remember Paul&#39;s words from 1Cor 6:12 that though our liberty in Christ allows us to do many things, not all things are profitable for our spiritual well-being. For example, if we know a friend who is struggling with the occult or with new age teaching, then we would do better to avoid celebrating Halloween to avoid confusing them about the truth.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to hear more of our teaching on Christian liberty from Paul&#39;s writing in the New Testament, we highly recommend you listen to our <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_book_of_colossians/\">Colossians</a></strong> study and our <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/first_corinthians/\">First Corinthians</a></strong> study. Both offer a clear and compelling explanation of Christian liberty in a world of ungodly possibilities. I believe you will be blessed by these studies.</p>\n\n<p>We hope this explanation helps guide you in making your family decision, and as with all things, trust the Lord to make His will for you known in your hearts. Our calling is to obey His will &ndash; for if we love Him, we will keep His commandments.&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~I know that I&rsquo;ve mentioned that I volunteer at the local Children&rsquo;s Shelter &ndash; this will be my fourth year working as the school&rsquo;s librarian. It isn&rsquo;t as if I don&rsquo;t know what we do there (I apply all pronouns herein very loosely to myself as only a fringe contributor to the work!!), but sometimes you have to come nose-to-nose with something before you really see it clearly.</p>\n\n<p>I was talking with my supervisor about a project that a local High School wants to do for our library. It involves building the cutest little &ldquo;reading houses&rdquo; for our kids to snuggle up in with a good book&hellip;a very good thing in my opinion. As we talked about the project, my supervisor described the little houses as three sided with an open front. She said, &ldquo;Some of our kids have been locked in closets, so we have to be careful about confined spaces.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Um&hellip;.what?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>OUR </strong></em>kids have been locked in closets?! And she said it as if describing their distaste for turnips: &ldquo;Some of our kids just don&rsquo;t like turnips, so we don&rsquo;t serve them at dinner.&rdquo; Well, then. Alrighty.</p>\n\n<p>It makes me feel physically sick. As I&rsquo;m typing this, I&rsquo;m fighting tears of rage &ndash; rage &ndash; just imagining it. This is why I am only a fringe contributor and generally unaware of the kids&rsquo; circumstances. I just can&rsquo;t handle it. It ignites something primal in me when I think of what these kids have suffered. Rejection. Humiliation. Isolation. Terror. Worthlessness. Confusion. Desperation...</p>\n\n<p>&hellip;Acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>That is the very worst thing: that mistreatment eventually leads you to conclude that it&rsquo;s only what you deserve.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the things you ask yourself when you experience abuse.<br />\n<em>Why?<br />\nWas I bad?<br />\nWhat did I do?</em></p>\n\n<p>And then you begin to answer yourself.<br />\n<em>Because you deserve it.<br />\nOf course you&rsquo;re bad, or you wouldn&rsquo;t be here.<br />\nYou lived.</em></p>\n\n<p>And then you accept it. Forever. Because when that conclusion is confirmed to you over and over and over again, it becomes a part of who you are. It becomes your truth and your identity. And in small ways and large, you walk around bumping shoulders with normal people while wearing a shirt of shame that says that you are an affront to all things good&hellip;and you know it. It makes you cowed. Or it makes you very very angry.</p>\n\n<p>As I thought about these little children huddled alone in the dark, I thought about the very nature of darkness and light and the physical and psychological impacts of both. Everyone can understand this. We hate getting up in the mornings before the sun comes up. We tell our kids to be home before dark. Horror movies rarely take place during the day. Light makes things grow. Darkness makes things dormant. No one was ever afraid of the light, and we rarely feel the compulsion to check under our beds during the daytime. It is a universal truth that light reveals and illuminates, while darkness conceals and obscures. There is understanding in light. There is obfuscation in darkness.</p>\n\n<p>If we were to distill it to its essence, we would assign moral significance to each, and designate darkness &ldquo;bad&rdquo; and light &ldquo;good&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible would affirm us in that, contrasting them frequently as aspects of evil and holiness. The Old Testament characterizes darkness sometimes as &lsquo;thick&rsquo; and &lsquo;dreadful&rsquo;. It describes a &lsquo;land of gloom and utter darkness&rsquo; from which there is no return. Some verses portray the people in darkness as &lsquo;wandering&rsquo;, &lsquo;groping&rsquo;, &lsquo;despairing&rsquo;, &lsquo;banished&rsquo;, and &lsquo;shrouded&rsquo;. One verse illustrates the darkness as a &lsquo;terror&rsquo;. Others call it a place where evil-doers hide, where pestilence stalks, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, and where people gnaw their tongues in agony. According to Psalm 143, it is the enemy who makes one dwell in darkness.</p>\n\n<p>But Isaiah declares that those walking in darkness have seen a great light, and &ldquo;on those living in the land of deep darkness, a light has dawned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jesus, for whom even the darkness will be as light, for He is the light and the life of man, has come to &ldquo;open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.&rdquo; He has come to &ldquo;turn the darkness into light before them&rdquo;; &ldquo;to those in darkness He says &lsquo;Be free.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Jesus, the Light of the World. Whoever follows Him will never (no, not ever!) walk in darkness, but will have the Light of Life. He came into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in Him should stay in the darkness because now they are children of the light and of the day who no longer belong to the night or to the darkness.</p>\n\n<p>Why, then, do we return to our closets?</p>\n\n<p>Do you know that many abuse survivors will return to their abuser, or repeat the behavior they experienced? In a perverse way, to them it seems only right. Many kids who have experienced confinement will return to their closets to sleep, feeling somehow more secure there than in an open room. Not to diminish the experiences of heinous abuse by comparison, but Spiritual &ldquo;survivors&rdquo; often do the same thing: we return to our misery out of some subconscious belief that it is no less than we deserve to be deprived of the Light&hellip;to be separated from God. And so we continue to work out our sin instead of working out our salvation, finding comfort in known behavior, &lsquo;deserved&rsquo; self-inflicted punishment, and a deprived existence. Acceptance. Identity.</p>\n\n<p>I want you to know that if this describes you, if this is the pattern of your behavior, it is time for you to come into the Light&hellip;and stay here. This is where you will heal, and grow healthy. This is where you will find hope and purpose and freedom. The Light is your security, your protection, your guide. &ldquo;This is the message we have heard from Him and declare to you: God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all.&rdquo; &ldquo;The LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end&rdquo;, for &ldquo;you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God&#39;s <em><strong>special possession</strong></em>, that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light.&rdquo; There is no returning to the dark. You will not find what you need there. Even in your closet, you are not hidden from the Light of the world; He will pursue you to the ends of the earth. It is time to abandon those strongholds forever. Come out&hellip;come out into the Light.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is dedicated to the kids walking in real physical and spiritual darkness all over the world. If you are so inclined, offer them the Light by reaching out in service or support to your local emergency shelter or foster care agencies and organizations. Or better yet&hellip;welcome a child into your home and bathe them in the Light.</p>"

No, that probably is not a sign of maturity. I was barely to the laundry room with these thoughts when I heard my husband&rsquo;s text tone on my phone and went to see the message.</p>\n\n<p>I could NOT make this up&hellip;&nbsp; (my comments in blue)</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Untitled.png\" style=\"border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; width: 300px; height: 450px; float: left;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><em>Hello, Melissa. God calling!! </em></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Notice how spiritually mature I was? &lsquo;<em><strong>No</strong></em>&hellip;don&rsquo;t bring them home for <em><strong>me</strong></em>,&rsquo; wink wink. I stood there in abject indecision before sending my reply, knowing what I should say (take the exit ramp!!), and absolutely powerless to say it. I stood there staring at those glazed rings of hell knowing that if they come into my home I will eat them. The decision to not decide was my decision, because I know that unless the Lord intervenes or comes again, when my husband arrives home an hour from now, he will be bearing the famed green, red, and white box with those little hellish puffs of lovelies inside. Then I will face another decision, because one indulgence of the flesh leads to another. And it&rsquo;s just this simple. Everything Paul was teaching the Corinthians in chapters 8-10 is right here on a plate. Or in a box, as the case may be.</span></p>\n\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t listened to this audio teaching&nbsp;(<a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\">Lesson 10A</a>) on the website, I would suggest that you head on over there right now if you have any kind of battle with your flesh. Or just hit your knees with the open Book, turn straight there, and just this one time you can skip the context, because I know you&rsquo;re looking at that picture above and&nbsp;thinking to yourself, &ldquo;Eating a donut isn&rsquo;t a sin.&rdquo; To which I would agree -&nbsp;in theory.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, it&rsquo;s another thing altogether, and that is the essence of Paul&rsquo;s point in these chapters. He&rsquo;s telling us that, &ldquo;He who would not fall down ought not walk in slippery places&rdquo; even if (especially if) he thinks he&rsquo;s sure-footed. I forget who said that, but it is the gist of this passage. If you&rsquo;re like my husband, when you look at those fried delights what you see is flour and sugar and oil, none of which you need in your very healthy body. When I look at them, I <em><strong>taste</strong></em> them, I <em><strong>feel</strong></em> them, I <em><strong>smell</strong></em> them, and it is pure hedonistic joy to me just imagining putting one in my mouth. I cannot possibly resist the temptation if I invite them into my kitchen! You see the problem.</p>\n\n<p>You have one of these things too: something that maybe has no appeal to me, but gives you a rush of pure bliss just in the imagining. We all have them. And when&nbsp;accommodated without restraint, they all lead us to sin and death and hell (not speaking of salvation, but of misery in our spiritual life and the loss of our rewards). <em>Freedom indulged can lead to sinful indulgence. </em>It&rsquo;s the walk down the primrose path. It&rsquo;s the slippery slope. It is a nearly irreversible course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So now, the decisions remain before me. Will I deny my liberty to eat that donut, or exercise it? Will I act with maturity or immaturity? Will I trade an eternal reward for that bite? Will it be worth it when I know what I forfeited? Will I worship God or self? These are my exit ramps. They are many, and varied, and flush with blessings, but will they be enough to make me flee&hellip;?</p>\n\n<p>Dear Lord, give me the self-discipline to beat my body and make it my slave!&nbsp;</p>"

Entire Christian denominations, schools of systematic theology, and even families and friendships have divided along eschatological lines, and these divisions run wide and deep with little possibility for common ground.</p>\n\n<p>Consider that some Christians believe the Bible teaches that the earth must experience a future time of great suffering and tribulation, while others believe that time has already come and gone. Some Christians understand Christ&rsquo;s promise of a coming kingdom as a metaphor for the Church, while others believe it is a 1,000-year period when the Lord rules on Earth.</p>\n\n<p>Today, it&#39;s easy to find believers holding these diametrically opposed interpretations of scripture while sitting side-by-side in church pews. Even&nbsp;our Christian vocabulary has expanded to describe the various eschatological camps and their views. Theologians have coined terms like &ldquo;amillennialist,&rdquo; &ldquo;preterist,&rdquo; &ldquo;futurist&rdquo; and &ldquo;pre-tribulation rapture&rdquo; to catalog the various disagreements over the proper interpretation of end times scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Curiously, these eschatology camps&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;<em>agree</em> on other foundational truths of the faith. Orthodox Christianity acknowledges the Bible&rsquo;s teaching of salvation by grace through faith in Christ and not by human works (Ephesians 2:8-9); that Jesus Christ was the Son of God Who took human form to die as a sacrifice in the place of sinners (John 3:14-18); and that the Church was given the mission to reach the world with the truth of the Gospel as we await our Lord&rsquo;s return (Matthew 28:18-20).</p>\n\n<p>All agree these truths are the core tenets of our faith, and&nbsp;we stand united on these truths because they can be understood plainly from the Word of God.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So how did the church fail to arrive at a common understanding of end times scripture?&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">How can Christians find so much agreement in the Bible on many important topics yet disagree so profoundly on the proper interpretation of prophecy of the book of Revelation in particular? Do not all Christians have access to the same Spirit (Ephesians 4:4) and Teacher (Matthew 23:8), Who promises to bring all to a common understanding (John 14:26)? Doesn&rsquo;t the Bible assure the Church that the Spirit will not confuse us concerning the truth (1Corinthians 14:32-33)?&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Clearly, something has gone wrong in the Church&#39;s approach to understanding eschatology, and the blame rests with us, not the Spirit. Simply put, the&nbsp;Church failed to promote and defend proper scholarship in the study of prophecy &ndash;&nbsp;or at the very least,&nbsp;it failed to identify and refute incorrect teaching. The Church has (usually) defended a Biblically correct view of important doctrines like salvation, the person of Christ, the Trinity and other foundational truths, but it just as reliably minimizes the importance of sound eschatology in the spirit of \"unity\" and \"fellowship.\" This is an unwise compromise.</p>\n\n<p>For example, two recent Bible&nbsp;commentaries (which most Christians wisely ignored) presented a plurality of views on important doctrines of the faith. One book offered to explain the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Four-Views-Salvation-Pluralistic-World/dp/0310212766\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>four views of salvation</strong></a>&rdquo; while the other examined the \"<strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Historical-Jesus-Five-Views/dp/0830838686\" target=\"_blank\">five views of Jesus</a>.\" </strong>Both&nbsp;failed to gain much of an audience among believers &ndash; and thankfully so! &ndash; because they imply that studying&nbsp;competing views&nbsp;is a&nbsp;valid means of discovering truth.</p>\n\n<p>This approach to Bible study is both dangerous and ineffective. Every view apart from the truth is, by definition, a lie, and so if a book offers to teach the&nbsp;\"four views of salvation,\" then by definition at least three of these view are wrong. Why waste time reading a book in which three quarters of the information contained within it&nbsp;is false? That&#39;s why Christians largely avoided reading these books.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, a scripture commentary&nbsp;presenting the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Revelation-Four-Views-Parallel-Commentary/dp/0840721285\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>four traditional views of Revelation</strong></a>&rdquo; continues to sell well to pastors, seminary students and other believers fifteen years after it was first published. Why are we comfortable with a less definitive understanding of prophecy than we are other areas of doctrine? At least three of these views are wrong, so why waste time entertaining a collection of false understandings?&nbsp;This&nbsp;double standard supports the myth that prophecy is unavoidably confusing, and therefore multiple interpretations are to be expected.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s set the record straight. Multiple, contradictory interpretations of prophecy should <em>not</em> be expected, much less tolerated within the Church. A proper interpretation of end times scripture is not a matter of opinion; it is a pursuit of the objective truth found in the Bible&nbsp;(2Peter 1:20), so we shouldn&#39;t be satisfied with a personal eschatology that doesn&#39;t fit all the data nor answer all the fundamental&nbsp;questions.</p>\n\n<p>An ancient parable about six blind men and an elephant (memorialized in the poem by John Godfrey Saxe) offers a useful illustration for how the Church fell into this predicament.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Six blind men encounter an elephant for the first time, and each examines a different part of the elephant&rsquo;s body to learn its true appearance. All six blind men arrive at wildly different conclusions, and before long the men begin to argue with one another over what they believe they have seen.</span></p>\n\n<p>The first man declares the elephant to be like a wall, another says it&rsquo;s like a tree trunk, another says like a pipe and still another says it&rsquo;s like a rope. In reality, each man correctly describes the part of the animal he examined, yet because his view was limited, his conclusion was wrong.&nbsp; No man examined the entire animal, so no one &ldquo;saw&rdquo; the elephant accurately.</p>\n\n<p>This parable provides an analogy for how the Church came to tolerate multiple, mutually-exclusive interpretations of eschatology. First, Christendom hasn&rsquo;t acknowledged that there can be only one correct interpretation of biblical prophecy. Like the elephant standing before the blind men, there is a truth waiting to be discovered, but the Church must first embrace the goal of finding that truth, one that fits all available data, while rejecting all other interpretations.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Biblical scholars have attempted to explain the whole of prophecy by examining only a part of the Biblical record, resulting in a myriad of incomplete and erroneous interpretations. Many of these incomplete views have been proposed by important church figures, who by their influence were able to obtain an audience for their views. For example, many leaders of the Reformation taught an <a href=\"http://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1951/December/martin-luther-and-the-end-of-the-world\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>over-realized eschatology</strong></a> (i.e., believing that more of God&#39;s program for history has been accomplished than is actually so), and these incorrect views persist today largely because of their authors&#39; reputations and revered place in church history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s telling that the chief reformer, Martin Luther, <a href=\"http://www.bible-researcher.com/antilegomena.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>voiced doubts</strong></a> over the inspired origins of the book of Revelation itself. He initially placed Revelation in his <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther's_canon\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Antilegomena</em></a></strong>, a compendium of Bible books Luther considered untrustworthy (together with Hebrews, James and Jude). Like the blind men in the parable, Luther saw only a part of God&rsquo;s prophetic story, and he was so perplexed by his limited understanding that he resorted to questioning the authenticity of scripture!</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s little wonder why Luther struggled with eschatology. He overlooked important details in God&#39;s prophetic plan, including the Lord&#39;s promise to regather the nation of Israel in a future day, resulting in an ill-conceived interpretation of end times events that continues to confuse and mislead Christians today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as the parable taught, correct interpretation of prophecy requires a holistic approach to study. Prophecy by its very nature yields its secrets in portions spread across the whole counsel of scripture. In my experience, the Spirit allocates us a proper understanding of&nbsp;prophecy only if we seek to find&nbsp;harmony across every book&nbsp;of Scripture. For example, a&nbsp;prophetic detail may be provided&nbsp;in the Old Testament, while&nbsp;the specific timing or sequence of that event&nbsp;isn&#39;t revealed until the Gospel accounts or an epistle in the&nbsp;New Testament. Therefore, we should expect that a proper&nbsp;understanding will require a stitching together of many details across the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, in my experience&nbsp;the Spirit may withhold our understanding of prophecy in one part of the Bible unless and until we cross-reference it with prophecy from other books,. In this way, He promotes in us&nbsp;an appreciation for the entire counsel of God&#39;s word. That&#39;s one reason why&nbsp;New Testament prophecy (i.e., the book of Revelation)&nbsp;often relies on symbols, pictures and shadows taken from Old Testament prophecy.&nbsp;Therefore, examining any prophetic passage isolated from the rest of the Biblical record is a mistake guaranteed to make a fool of the student.</p>\n\n<p>If we want to get to the truth and establish a common, orthodox understanding of eschatology, our interpretations must bring the entire Biblical record into alignment and tie up all &ldquo;loose ends.&rdquo; If our interpretation fails to account for all the evidence in scripture, then we must conclude our interpretation is wrong somewhere and reconsider our position, even if doing so sets us against our denomination, our church tradition or the community of believers in our church. We should prefer to know the truth than to believe ourselves \"right.\"</p>\n\n<p>The interdependence and self-reinforcing nature of scripture should come as no surprise to the experienced Bible student. The sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments were penned over centuries by many human authors, but all were inspired by the same Holy Spirit (2Timothy 3:16; 2Peter 1:21) to yield a unified story of God&rsquo;s plan to glorify His Son.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, we could compare the Bible to a novel with sixty-six chapters, where the plot and characters build one chapter after another until the story reaches a climax in the final chapters. Obviously, we would never expect to understand a novel&rsquo;s final chapter unless we had first read and understood all earlier chapters.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect to understand Revelation - the final climactic chapter in God&rsquo;s novel - until we have first gained some understanding of the preceding sixty-five books of scripture. To do otherwise risks repeating the mistake of the blind men in the parable. Studying prophecy piecemeal is akin to taking hold of a trunk or leg or ear, drawing false conclusions about its meaning and then provoking arguments with others who have made the same mistake.</p>\n\n<p>I believe these persistent arguments over prophecy have led many Bible students to assume that understanding prophecy is beyond reach. After all, they will conclude, if accomplished scholars disagree on the meaning of prophecy, what hope does the average Bible student have to uncover the truth?</p>\n\n<p>While understandable, this view is flatly wrong. Prophetic scripture can be understood clearly, since the Lord made prophecy available for our benefit, and when Bible students forgo&nbsp;the study of prophecy, they walk away from the richest, most rewarding content in God&rsquo;s word. They also set aside a huge portion of Scripture, since most books of the Bible are prophetic to some degree.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than avoiding prophecy, Bible students should chase after it, tackle it, and wrestle with it, refusing to let it go until it reveals its secrets in plain, understandable terms and yielding its blessing in the process (Genesis 32:24-26). While no prophecy can be understood apart from the Spirit&rsquo;s revelation (2Peter 1:20), the Lord delights to reveal His truth to those who earnestly seek it while patiently awaiting Him to reveal it.&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~I set out this spring finally to move back into formal ministry after a hiatus. Still uncertain about my place in my mega-church community, I sought some counsel about how to do that. What I got was an open door. I was encouraged to &ldquo;dangle a hook and see what bites.&rdquo; I liked that. I liked that I did not have to come under the formal organization of the church, and was pretty much free to do as I liked. But...I have a bit of fundamentalist in me and I wanted some accountability &ndash; a covering of protection so to speak &ndash; so I sought some more input.</p>\n\n<p>I met with three of the greatest women leaders known to church establishment who blessed me abundantly and told me to &ldquo;Go and do it, and tell us what you need&hellip;&rdquo; and I was thrilled. This is what I had always wanted: the freedom to do it myself. And that should have been all the warning I needed.</p>\n\n<p>Now, please, whatever you do, do not hear this as a criticism of those sweet supportive women. That is not what this is. This is one of those teachable moments that God has used to show me something. Something important, because now it&rsquo;s my turn. Yes, one of the members of my summer&rsquo;s small group has decided to lead a group this fall and has asked for my support. The question is, what have I learned about what she needs?<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWell, I first need to tell you how my summer study ended. It ended with these words from the Lord:</p>\n\n<p><em>Edom may say, &ldquo;Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins.&rdquo; But this is what the LORD Almighty says: &ldquo;They may build, but I will demolish.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\"A son honors his father and a slave his master. If I am a father, where is the honor due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?\" says the LORD Almighty. \"It is you priests who show contempt for my name.&rdquo; But you ask, &#39;How have we shown contempt for your name?&#39; \"By offering defiled food on my altar.&rdquo; But you ask, &#39;How have we defiled you?&#39; \"By saying that the LORD&#39;s table is contemptible. When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? When you sacrifice lame or diseased animals, is that not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?\" says the LORD Almighty.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I am not pleased with you,\" says the LORD Almighty, \"and I will accept no offering from your hands.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;In every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to me, because my name will be great among the nations,\" says the LORD Almighty. \"But you profane it by saying, &#39;The Lord&#39;s table is defiled,&#39; and, &#39;Its food is contemptible.&#39; And you say, &#39;What a burden!&#39; and you sniff at it contemptuously,\" says the LORD Almighty. \"When you bring injured, lame or diseased animals and offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from your hands?\" says the LORD. \"Cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord. For I am a great king,\" says the LORD Almighty, \"and my name is to be feared among the nations.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\"And now, you priests, this warning is for you. If you do not listen, and if you do not resolve to honor my name,\" says the LORD Almighty, \"I will send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already cursed them, because you have not resolved to honor me. Because of you I will rebuke your descendants; I will smear on your faces the dung from your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with it.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\"For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, because he is the messenger of the LORD Almighty and people seek instruction from his mouth.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\"So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people&hellip;\"</em> (excerpts from Malachi 1-2).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And I <em><strong>had</strong></em> been soundly humiliated before all the people, which is why I was reading Malachi to begin with, why the Lord was taking me to the wood-shed, and why I am subsequently not leading this fall.</p>\n\n<p>Let me explain. Summers for me are usually routine. Quiet even. And I&rsquo;m looking forward very shortly to an empty nest. I&rsquo;m a stay at home mom, so I&rsquo;m asking myself what that looks like a year from now&hellip;and deciding that it&rsquo;s not good. I figured this summer would be a great time to make this move back to ministry and that I would have plenty of time to not only lead a group, but to write the lessons as we went. Then, as the parable of the soils worked itself out in my life, those commitments got choked by other distractions until I was barely keeping up, and then only by compromising and cutting corners. I was bringing a lame, diseased offering to the Lord&rsquo;s Table as if it were a burden to do so. I was a cheat.</p>\n\n<p>That line where God demands&hellip; &ldquo;Try offering them to your Governor&hellip;&rdquo; bore itself out toward the end of the summer when I was invited, by those same generous grace-filled women who launched me a few months earlier, to come and lead a group of women at our church. I knew I didn&rsquo;t have time. My husband warned me not to over-commit. But pride won, and through another compromise, I met my Waterloo. I brought a shabby lesson, ill-suited to the group, cobbled together from what I had already lead my other group through, and I sat alone on one side of the table and watched 10 blank expressions all night long. I listened to conversation that completely missed the point of the lesson I intended to communicate. I hung by the seat of my pants at the top of the flagpole and swung in the breeze. I was very confused at the end of the evening; I had never had an experience like that one. Jesus had never&hellip;no, not ever&hellip;let me down in leading a lesson. Stomach flu&hellip;His strength carried me right through a solid weekend retreat. Lack of sleep&hellip;no problem. Trouble at home&hellip;forget about it. Come unprepared &ndash; again &ndash; and expect Jesus to bail me out&hellip;not gonna happen. Jesus will not be accepting sloppy seconds.</p>\n\n<p>So what does this have to do with anything? Well, what I learned is that Lone-Ranger Christian-ing does not work. I was thrilled to be left alone to do what I wanted, but I didn&rsquo;t realize that I had been left at the edge of a gaping chasm that was about to swallow me whole. You don&rsquo;t survive that alone. So, when my friend said that she wanted to lead but she couldn&rsquo;t do it alone, I knew she was right&hellip;and was wise to realize it. And I knew that I could not bless her with my words &ndash; empower her to &ldquo;go&rdquo; &ndash; and then abandon her to the work, because, God knows, the devil will not like it, and through every means necessary will work to prevent her from accomplishing what she is determined to do. He will make her busy. He will make her confused and uncertain and fearful. He will attack her kids, her husband, her health. It will rain every week. Her computer will go on the fritz. She will have mom-brain syndrome. The heat will go out. A friend will become needy. There will be other things to do, other places to be. And she will quit. Or begin to offer God her sloppy seconds just to get by until it&rsquo;s done. As if serving Him is a burden. And then she will join me in the woodshed after hanging in humiliation on the flagpole.</p>\n\n<p>I will not have it.</p>\n\n<p>In this I am determined.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learned about leaving someone with the genuine invitation to &ldquo;let us know if you need anything&rdquo;: they will not ask. They will not shoot up a flare so you can pinpoint their location and come to their rescue. They will not cry out. They will not wave a flag. They will not call, email or text. But they will very much need help in the most desperate ways. Ways that make them feel crazy, or worse, <em><strong>needy</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what is essential to those of us, all of us, out here trying to do this thing:<br />\n-you<br />\n&nbsp;-your prayers (Tell us, and often, that you have our backs.)<br />\n&nbsp;-your time (Give it&hellip;don&rsquo;t wait for us to ask&hellip; just show up.)<br />\n&nbsp;-your genuine interest / friendship / love (Coffee? How&rsquo;s your kiddo? Nice haircut!)<br />\n-you speaking into our lives (I think you&rsquo;re approaching error here. Maybe you have too much on your plate. How&rsquo;s your own relationship with God? Say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, for the love...!!)<br />\n-you speaking into our work (This doesn&rsquo;t seem up to your usual standards. Did you cut some corners here? Dig deeper&hellip;this isn&rsquo;t enough.)<br />\n-your continued encouragement / rebuke / admonishment / truth as you see it (Sure, you&rsquo;re managing, but you need to let something go. You&rsquo;re not giving God your best in this.)<br />\n-to not have to ask (We don&rsquo;t want to have to tell you we&rsquo;re in trouble. See the third point above.)<br />\n-for you not to assume that we are more capable than we are (We&rsquo;re not. And even if it seems like we are right now, we won&rsquo;t be in a couple of days!)</p>\n\n<p>Wash. Rinse. Repeat.</p>\n\n<p>My poor friend has no idea what&rsquo;s about to hit her. I may be like a tidal wave, but I am resolute in being a faithful ally and comrade in her work. I am breathless with anticipation because I sense God about to launch an amazing force for His kingdom on this world, and I am lower than a toad&rsquo;s throat with humility that He still has enough grace left for me that I get to stand with her at the edge&hellip;and jump! Together.</p>\n\n<p>post script &ndash; Faithful reader to the end&hellip;bless you for your perseverance with this one! Maybe you never read Malachi before and so that, in itself, was your reward for enduring my commentary. Thank you for hanging in there! You are an encouragement to me!</p>"

                 "body": "<p>How does an Internet ministry measure&nbsp;success?</p>\n\n<p>As the director of Verse By Verse Ministry International, I&nbsp;ask this question everyday. Is VBVMI considered successful because our website&nbsp;distributes millions of audio lessons and hosts hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;visitors each year? Are we successful because we hosted numerous&nbsp;live events on&nbsp;four continents to thousands of students? Do the thousands of encouraging letters,&nbsp;Facebook likes and donations we&rsquo;ve received&nbsp;this year mean we&rsquo;ve succeeded?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, these signs of progress please us. In the first&nbsp;half of 2014, our website, podcasts and smartphone apps have all experienced strong&nbsp;growth in visitors and activity. Our Facebook page has surged to nearly 18,000&nbsp;followers in barely 20 months. Requests for live teaching events in&nbsp;Asia,&nbsp;Europe, Africa and the Americas continue to increase, and the Lord has met all&nbsp;our financial needs through the faithful and generous gifts&nbsp;of supporters like&nbsp;you. Indeed, the Lord has blessed us in many ways.</p>\n\n<p>But we don&rsquo;t define our&nbsp;success&nbsp;by these things.</p>\n\n<p>We define success as&nbsp;obedience to the Lord. Are we&nbsp;teaching His word accurately, honestly and humbly? Are we preaching the true&nbsp;Gospel of&nbsp;grace boldly and unfailingly? Are we living according to the word of&nbsp;God, so that our lives reflect what we preach? Does our teaching inspire&nbsp;others&nbsp;to greater obedience as well? That&rsquo;s how we measure success.</p>\n\n<p>Based on our listeners&rsquo; feedback, I believe we&rsquo;re meeting&nbsp;our goal. Everyday, we hear from students around the world, who tell us they have&nbsp;been challenged to know Christ more and obey Him better:&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6><em>&ldquo;I want to thank&nbsp;you for giving me a better perspective and understanding that has changed my&nbsp;life and made me stronger in my faith and has&nbsp;allowed me to know Jesus Christ&nbsp;as my Savior like I have never known Him before.&rdquo; &ndash; J.E.&nbsp;</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><em>&ldquo;Thank you for your teaching. It&nbsp;has been an answer from God for my heart&rsquo;s cry. Slowly but surely your teaching&nbsp;is bringing a big change which I&nbsp;am so grateful to God for.&rdquo; &ndash; M</em></h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These testimonies inspire us to continue traveling, teaching and&nbsp;encouraging believers everywhere to follow the Lord through His word. But we&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t resting on our past successes.</p>\n\n<p>VBVMI continues to expand its library of verse-by-verse courses online,&nbsp;while traveling to teach in more places in the world. In 2014 alone,&nbsp;VBVMI will&nbsp;host live events in Singapore, the Philippines, Costa Rica, Norway (twice) and Hawaii&nbsp;(twice) &ndash; in addition to our weekly teaching in&nbsp;Texas. We also have new&nbsp;features coming to our apps and website, and of course we&rsquo;re looking forward to&nbsp;our&nbsp;annual VBVMI Bible Conference&nbsp;in October.</p>\n\n<p>The global impact of VBVMI would not be possible without your support.&nbsp;By your generosity, we continue offering all these services free of&nbsp;charge,&nbsp;which means even more student learning and obeying the word of God. This is true discipleship, and I thank you for helping us accomplish this all-important mission.</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Several years ago, I was teaching a Sunday school class about the nature of Jesus.&nbsp; I made the comment that of course, Jesus could not sin.&nbsp; I was stopped immediately.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean Jesus couldn&rsquo;t sin?&nbsp; If He couldn&rsquo;t sin, then His temptation wasn&rsquo;t real!&rdquo;&nbsp; I admit, I was a little surprised at the reaction.&nbsp; At the time, I sort of took it for granted that Jesus couldn&rsquo;t sin.&nbsp; After the class, I did some research and found that there was quite a division over this issue.&nbsp; Even one of my favorite theologians said he thought Jesus <em>could</em> sin, but that of course He wouldn&rsquo;t have sinned; in other words, He had the <em>ability</em> to sin.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although that was quite a few years ago, the issue has always bugged me.&nbsp; While some might see this as about as important as knowing how many angels fit on the head of a pin, I actually think studying this issue that can help us as believers have a better understanding of God.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s something about which we should be in agreement as Christians, but more importantly, it reveals something about the character and nature of God.&nbsp; Thankfully, Scripture gives us the answer.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are several reasons why I believe Jesus could not sin.&nbsp; First, and perhaps most importantly, Jesus is God.&nbsp;Yes, He became a man, but He was not a man in the sense that we are now, nor even in the sense that Adam was.&nbsp;Adam was a creature, albeit initially without sin, but because of Adam&rsquo;s sin, we are all born sinners (Romans 5).&nbsp;Jesus, however, had God as His Father.&nbsp;It is from our father by which we get our nature.&nbsp; Adam being our father, we were&nbsp;born like him as sinners, but&nbsp;God being Jesus&rsquo;s Father, Jesus was born without sin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unlike Adam, a creature, Jesus was God, as well as a man (begotten, not made).&nbsp; By definition, God cannot sin.&nbsp; Indeed, everything God does is right.&nbsp; Psalm 145:17 says, &ldquo;<em>The Lord is righteous in all His ways And kind in all His deeds</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Deuteronomy 32:4 says, <em>&ldquo;The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is He</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore, if Jesus is God, and He is, then He cannot sin.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Second, from before the foundation of the world, it was God&rsquo;s purpose for Jesus to die on the cross for our sins.&nbsp; Ephesians 1 says, &ldquo;<em>3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, 4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love 5 He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Furthermore, Acts 2 says, &ldquo;<em>22 Men of Israel, listen to these words: &nbsp;Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know&mdash; 23 this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death. 24 But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cross was always God&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp; We were chosen from before the foundation of the world, and it was God who predetermined that Jesus would die on the cross.&nbsp; We know that whatever God decrees comes about.&nbsp; Isaiah 55:11 says, &ldquo;<em>So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; It will not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Jesus could have sinned, then it was possible, theoretically, for God&rsquo;s purposes to be thwarted.&nbsp; Since that is not possible, then Jesus could not have sinned.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Third, God made a covenant in blood with Abraham.&nbsp; Genesis 15 says:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>2 Abram said, &ldquo;O Lord God, what will You give me, since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?&rdquo; 3 And Abram said, &ldquo;Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my house is my heir.&rdquo; 4 Then behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, &ldquo;This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own body, he shall be your heir.&rdquo; 5 And He took him outside and said, &ldquo;Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.&rdquo; And He said to him, &ldquo;So shall your descendants be.&rdquo; 6 Then he believed in the Lord; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness. 7 And He said to him, &ldquo;I am the Lord who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess it.&rdquo; 8 He said, &ldquo;O Lord God, how may I know that I will possess it?&rdquo; 9 So He said to him, &ldquo;Bring Me a three year old heifer, and a three year old female goat, and a three year old ram, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.&rdquo; 10 Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds. 11 The birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.&nbsp; 12 Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him. 13 God said to Abram, &ldquo;Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years. 14 But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions. 15 As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age. 16 Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.&rdquo;&nbsp; 17 It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces. 18 On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, &ldquo;To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates:&nbsp; 19 the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite 20 and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim 21 and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When God passed through the pieces of the animals, He was making a covenant that essentially said that if He did not keep it, may what happened to the animals happen to Him.&nbsp; Unlike man, when God makes a covenant, He always keeps it.&nbsp; The Abrahamic covenant was fulfilled in the new covenant, which, as we saw above, was something God planned before the foundation of the earth.&nbsp; If Jesus could sin, this covenant could not be fulfilled.&nbsp; Therefore, Jesus could not sin.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Back to my Sunday school class, the protest was, &ldquo;if Jesus could not sin, then His temptations were a farce!&rdquo;&nbsp; You can sort of see the logic here, right?&nbsp; What good are temptations if you can&rsquo;t sin?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First of all, the temptations were real.&nbsp; In particular, Jesus&rsquo; temptations by the devil were so extreme, no human could withstand them.&nbsp; Consider that Adam, surrounded in the best possible environment, could not keep the one commandment God gave him.&nbsp; Although he had the ability to not sin, under the best circumstances his flesh gave in to the temptation to be like God.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, Jesus&rsquo; flesh surely felt the impact of such severe temptations.&nbsp; As a human, even Jesus would be extremely weak from not eating for 40 days.&nbsp; But because He is God, Jesus can overcome all temptations.&nbsp; So, unlike us, whose spirit is willing but the flesh is weak (Mark 14:38), Jesus&rsquo; Spirit is in complete control of His flesh.&nbsp; He exhibits perfect obedience, as He truly loves God with all His heart, soul, mind and strength.&nbsp; His perfect righteousness is demonstrated, in part, by His ability to overcome the most extreme temptations.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">More importantly, this issue highlights something that is difficult for us to fully comprehend.&nbsp; In this life, we may never realize just how holy God is and just how sinful we are.&nbsp; Indeed, God informs us that &ldquo;<em>8 For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,&rdquo; declares the Lord.&nbsp; 9 &ldquo;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts than your thoughts</em>.&rdquo; (Isaiah 55)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We only see glimpses of God&rsquo;s holiness in Scripture.&nbsp; In Isaiah 6, we read:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>1 In the year of King Uzziah&rsquo;s death I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple. 2 Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3 And one called out to another and said,</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>&ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts,</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>The whole earth is full of His glory.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>4 And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, while the temple was filling with smoke. 5 Then I said,</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>&ldquo;Woe is me, for I am ruined!</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Because I am a man of unclean lips,</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>And I live among a people of unclean lips;</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Faced with the reality of the holiness of God, all Isaiah can do is say he is ruined because of his sin.&nbsp; The word ruined means to perish, to be destroyed, to be undone.&nbsp; How often do we have this fear of God in light of our own sin?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Peter also demonstrates this fear.&nbsp; After Jesus provides a miraculous catch of fish in Luke 5, Peter reacts:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>8 But when Simon Peter saw that, he fell down at Jesus&rsquo; feet, saying, &ldquo;Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!&rdquo;&nbsp; 9 For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken; 10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While these glimpses of God&rsquo;s holiness are helpful, I can&rsquo;t help but think how far short we must come in really knowing how great is the divide between God&rsquo;s holiness and our sinfulness.&nbsp; We will only fully know how holy He is when we are in heaven (1 Corinthians 13:12).</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The testimony of Scripture is that Jesus did not sin (e.g., Hebrews 4:15, 9:14; 1 Peter 1:19, 2:22; 2 Corinthians 5:21, 1 John 3:5).&nbsp; As shown above, Scripture also testifies that Jesus could not sin.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s good news for us, because by faith in Christ, His righteousness is credited to us, and that is the only way we can be righteous.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved</em>.&rdquo; (Acts 4:12)</p>"

I look at them and want them dead, and cast into the deepest corner of hell to endure unmentionable terror for all of eternity. That is truth. God help me.</p>\n\n<p>I have learned in so many ways just not to care; to turn off the emotion; out of helpless frustration to disengage for the sake of my own sanity. I know the end of the story. I know things get real bad before they get better. Evil seems to win for a time, and then...Jesus. I tell myself that I have solace in that, but in truth, it&rsquo;s a justification for not becoming involved.&nbsp; Apathy is a simpler response, and it requires so much less investment. It hurts to feel. And to feel powerless to end the evil and heal the hurt.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if I&rsquo;m alone.</p>\n\n<p>And then, I wonder if what I feel in unguarded moments is God&rsquo;s intense longing for these people: these lost people who have hurt people. I wonder if the unquenchable fire that burns in my heart is His all-consuming love for them.&nbsp; I wonder if I&rsquo;ve mistaken His holy desire for my emotion before turning it off and tuning it out.&nbsp; And I wonder if my apathetic emotional distance stands in the way of His goal. Maybe He <em><strong>wants</strong></em> me to feel. Maybe He <em><strong>wants</strong></em> me to rage. Maybe He wants to consume me with His love for these lost sheep until I can rage against <em><strong>their</strong></em> enemy. Maybe. What if that?</p>\n\n<p>This is where I find myself. I don&rsquo;t <em><strong>want</strong></em> to become involved. I don&rsquo;t <em><strong>want</strong></em> to feel pity for them. I don&rsquo;t <em><strong>want</strong></em> to pray for them, but in that, I sense the deepest kind of rebellion and hatred. How can I withhold God&rsquo;s blessing from any man, when He would not withhold it Himself? I know that God would have no man perish, but all to come to repentance.&nbsp; I know that I am in no way better, (as evidenced by my confessions here!) less guilty, or more deserving of salvation than the Isis militant. Christ is the great equalizer.</p>\n\n<p>And yet&hellip;I find myself like Jonah, unwilling to intervene, subconsciously sitting on a hill waiting for their destruction, and bitter unto death. Like the elder prodigal son, outraged that this wayward ingrate could have the right to waltz into the Father&rsquo;s grace. Just like that. It is a bitter pill to think that that they could have their slate wiped as clean as mine. I&rsquo;m just telling you how I feel. I&rsquo;m not justifying. I know it&rsquo;s wrong on every level, but in the end, I cannot escape this truth that I&rsquo;m trying very hard to suppress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But&hellip;what if&hellip; What if He wants to turn it all on its head?&nbsp; What if, by praying <em><strong>for </strong></em>these men, I can end the suffering of the innocents on which they prey.&nbsp; What if all of heaven is just waiting for me to act? Are the armies of heaven poised, waiting for the command that will come only on the heels of my intercession? Are they ready to wage war in the heavenlies if only I will commit myself to the battle? Worse men than these have lived &ndash; and Jesus asked the Lord to forgive them because they did not know what they were doing. Can I join him in that prayer?&nbsp; Can I?</p>\n\n<p>Yes. I can. Even with my heart guarded and reticent, I can begin. Though it feels like grievous betrayal, I can say the words. Though my voice is weak and my determination weaker, I can whisper. Though the blood of the innocent cries out from the ground, the blood of Christ is louder still. Have mercy, our Father. Have mercy.</p>\n\n<p>Can you join me? Can you try? Can you set aside your need&nbsp;to see&nbsp;justice, and ask for God&rsquo;s goodness to find them? Can you do it in spite your justifiable righteous indignation? Can you do it because He did it first? Can you do it to empower Christ&rsquo;s heavenly armies in the true battle, and to see love win? Can you?</p>"

No judgment intended...I just found it interesting.</span></p>\n\n<p>I pondered the \"humility\" side of the question and sought to understand Biblical humility. Before this question was asked, I thought humility = meekness. Meekness is a mild and quiet nature often reflected in someone who is cowed or submissive and lacking initiative or will.</p>\n\n<p>Numbers 12:3 says that Moses was \"very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth,\" and yet Moses led a nation of over a million people! He sat in judgment, made rulings, and was G-d&#39;s chosen agent on earth to deliver His Law.</p>\n\n<p>The more I studied Biblical humility in the persons of Moses, David, Solomon (Ecclesiastes... whoah!), and especially Christ driving out the money changers with a whip? (John 2:15) and telling his disciples to buy a sword if they didn&#39;t have one? (Luke 22:36), the more&nbsp;I discovered that humility is NOT meekness.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Biblical humility is knowing your place in relation to G-d and in relation to others around you then behaving in a manner consistent with that reality.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Moses knew his place before G-d was as a servant. At the same time Moses was in a position of authority over an entire nation. Moses&#39; humility was in behaving in a manner consistent with that reality. He was NOT a meek man bringing that weak sauce.&nbsp; Christ knew His place before the Father was as a servant (\"not My will but Your will be done\"). At the same time Jesus was in a position of authority over *everything in creation* (Matthew 28:18, Colossians 2:10).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Biblical humility is not *lacking* in will but rather placing G-d&#39;s will above our own.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In regards to humility and wealth, I believe Paul said it best:</p>\n\n<h6>\"Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am. I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need. I can do all these things through Christ who strengthens me.\" (Philippians 4:11-13)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>May we all find&nbsp;our place of humility before the Lord.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

If you&rsquo;ve been reading long, you&rsquo;ll know that in spite of all my big-talk and bluster, I will run from a confrontation every time. Yet I seem to find myself dragged into them by indignation and the need to &ldquo;speak&rdquo; into an issue. Here we go again.</p>\n\n<p>This friend posted a timely call to faith on her Facebook page with regard to mental illness. To be completely fair, it was about finding freedom in Christ from anything that has mastered us, but she spoke specifically to the issue of mental illness. Scripture says that we are slaves to what controls us. In that, I agree. But I felt her perspective was skewed and in error to say that we are slaves to mental illness in the same way she would say I am a slave to (my recent nemesis) a Krispy Kreme Donut &ndash; as if I have a choice. As if someone with mental illness has a choice and can choose to exercise it.</p>\n\n<p>I know this friend well. I know, and have never doubted, her sincerity in wanting to proclaim freedom for captives, but as I was performing the yearly August-ritual-for-apple-tree-owners I realized that this idea of choice is the very thing that troubled me so deeply about her remarks. See this apple?</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/apples.png\" style=\"width: 374px; height: 282px; border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not perfect. In fact, it is so crooked that it will not (I promise you!) go through that wonder of wonders, the apple-peeler-corer-slicer, without wobbling. The apple didn&rsquo;t choose to be made this way. It can&rsquo;t choose to be any different. It just is. And it is not a failure or a weakness or a lack of faith on the apple&rsquo;s part that it can&rsquo;t suddenly morph into the perfect fruit by sheer force of will.</p>\n\n<p>The question is, (as I asked myself repeatedly today) why there are no perfect apples that will fit perfectly through my perfect solution for apples. The answer is The Fall. Depravity. Sin. Disease. Death. No area of life or nature has escaped it, including our bodies and our minds. Let&rsquo;s get scientific for a minute. Clinical depression and mental illness are not states of mind. They are not a choice. These are diseases of our bodies that cause us to think wonky but not notice that our version of reality is just a bit &ldquo;off&rdquo;. These infirmities come to us by way of Adam&rsquo;s first sin. To a greater degree with each passing year, disease and illness damage the living world. You can&rsquo;t pray your way free from this deformity. You can&rsquo;t recite enough scripture to reverse the effects of sin on your DNA. Until Jesus comes again, we&rsquo;re stuck with our bodies and their gross distortion from the original design. This is scripture, folks.</p>\n\n<p>What troubled me about my friend&rsquo;s statements was that they dismissed worldly solutions as viable options for treating these illnesses, because it seemed that she did not in fact see them as illnesses at all. In fact, there was implicit guilt and shame for being &ldquo;enslaved to&rdquo; or &ldquo;deluded by&rdquo; these treatments as answers to the problem; Jesus plus nothing should be sufficient, she proposed. But, friends, she would not say that to a believer with cancer, would she? She would encourage them to seek every medical treatment available, while continuing to pray for healing, and hoping that it was the Lord&rsquo;s will to grant it. There would be no shame in that. She would not consider them &ldquo;enslaved&rdquo; by chemotherapy, or &ldquo;deluded&rdquo; by their need for it. Neither should she believe that about a person with mental illness.</p>\n\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s reason together. We, like the crooked apples (oh, so crooked, and so very many of them), have been born with deformity, antagonistic to the Creator&rsquo;s plan, physically warped, and wobbling through life. For some of us that looks like crooked teeth. For some of us that looks like mental illness and depression. God in His mercy has provided help in this world for our afflictions&hellip;plants and animals and scientists, oh my&hellip;to ease our pain and heal our sickness. Why, oh why, should we forfeit His gifts because they are not &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;? Yes, Jesus came to heal all our diseases. And He endowed men and women with gifts to do just that. It doesn&rsquo;t sound all high and pious. It sounds like reason. I&rsquo;m sorry if it doesn&rsquo;t leave you all warm and fuzzy with emotion.</p>\n\n<p>Do not hear me say I don&rsquo;t believe in miraculous healing. I do, unequivocally. But I think, like all miracles, that is the exception rather than the rule. I think, like so many things, God, in His infinite wisdom has provided very real, tangible, practical, accessible (for now), solutions to illness, and we border on becoming ungrateful, demanding, thrill-seeking children for thinking that we need something more exciting, more romanticized, more dramatic than a simple pill or someone to talk to who is licensed to help us.&nbsp; And when we stop seeing modern medicine as a gift from God, we tend to vilify our brothers and sisters who take advantage of those resources by calling them deluded slaves, unfaithful, and unbelieving. Shame on us. We should not call unacceptable what God has approved.</p>\n\n<p>Ah, but you may say that there are some apples that, even while still on the tree, have the appearance of perfection. The core is straight through and through. The skin is rosy and red. The flesh is firm and there&rsquo;s not a blemish to be seen. Know what happens to those apples? The Japanese Beetles attack it. They&rsquo;re nasty little creatures straight from the pit of hell. And when we apply the metaphor to humans, the description holds true! Some of us are not wonked in our DNA, but in the course of our lives and spiritual development, we encounter a period where up is down and down is sideways and we can&rsquo;t make heads or tails of normal daily life. The difference between this affliction and clinical depression or true mental illness, is that we know there is something wrong; things are not normal, and we don&rsquo;t like it! These are the times for wielding the sword of the Spirit. We seek the guidance of trusted Christian brothers and sister, the counsel of the Word, and the Spirit of God, and then we unsheathe our weapon and use it against those vicious little beasts. We take our thoughts captive and make them obedient to Christ. We renew our minds in the word of God. And often, through His grace and the strength of His Spirit, we can endure, even overcome, in Christ. But sometimes, even for the faithful, in spite of everything, the darkness continues to grow and close in around us until all we can see is a pinprick of light. When that happens, and we have exhausted every other method, it may be time to add to our arsenal a little help until we can find our way to the light again.</p>\n\n<p>What I want to say to those of you who do not know mental illness on a first name basis, is this: please do not presume to have an answer that is carved in stone. Be patient with a weaker brother who may not have the spiritual maturity to apply spiritual disciplines to their ills. Be tender toward those who cannot find their way out of the darkness without the help God has provided through medicine and counseling. Be loving. Be gracious. Be merciful. Be kind. Be gentle. Be Jesus to them. Do not become a resounding gong ringing out their failures, heaping guilt on their backs, shaming them in public so they have to hide their struggle in a private hell because they have sought a source of healing that does not meet your approval.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What I want to say to those of you who struggle with depression or mental unsoundness of any kind is this: GET HELP! And GOD BLESS YOU in that! He has provided it. It is for you. There is no shame in it. My apple is crooked in a little different way than yours. I take an aspirin for that. And I&rsquo;m not afraid to admit it. It doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m a slave to the aspirin bottle. It means I&rsquo;m grateful to God for the relief He has provided until He makes all things new. Glory! And remember, fellow sufferer-of-ills, at the end of the day, even crooked apples make great pie. God redeems all.&nbsp;</p>"

Sometimes He has us \"bench press\" for patience.&nbsp; Other times He might have us doing \"curls\" for kindness or perhaps He wants us to \"flex\" our forbearance.&nbsp; When it comes to spiritual <em>endurance</em>, however, James tells us that the proper exercise is the <strong>testing of our faith</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>James also ties our faith to wisdom declaring, \"If anyone lacks wisdom, he should ask of G-d,\" and&nbsp;Solomon says in Proverbs 9:10, \"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.\"</p>\n\n<p>How little did I realize that along with an answer to my prayer for wisdom I would also be getting a large portion of the fear of the Lord and an extra helping of faith.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><em>Surgery</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>In December, my daughter, Alex,&nbsp;had surgery to correct a problem with her inner ear.&nbsp; While all surgery carries a certain level of risk, my wife&#39;s side of the family has a history of major problems with general anesthesia including cardiac arrest and death on the operating table.&nbsp; Thank G-d they have all been successfully revived and later recovered but I was more than a little worried with my little girl facing such risk.</p>\n\n<p>In that situation I was forced to face a truth that most (especially men!) find highly uncomfortable:&nbsp; I could do absolutely nothing to help or protect my youngest child.&nbsp; <em>Her life was entirely out of my hands.</em></p>\n\n<p>For a guy like me who wants to help with everything and be \"Mr. Fixit\", this was a very frightening and humbling experience.&nbsp; It forced me out of my normal \"I&#39;ll call upon G-d as backup if I can&#39;t handle the situation\" mindset and into the reality of \"apart from Me you can do nothing\" (John 15:5).&nbsp; My daughter&rsquo;s life has <strong>always </strong>been in the Lord&#39;s hands, not mine and&nbsp;this circumstance bluntly reminded me of that fact.&nbsp; If I can paraphrase Matthew 6:27: \"Who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his daughter&#39;s life?\"</p>\n\n<p>On the day of Alex&#39;s surgery, as the nurses wheeled her out of my sight into the operating room, G-d brought me to the point where I had to face the fact that He has the power of life and death and I did not.&nbsp; To stand face to face with that realization before the sovereign G-d of the universe is a humbling and fearful place to be.&nbsp; But the fear of the Lord is only the beginning of wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>As He brought me to that realization, G-d also placed some questions upon my heart:<br />\n<br />\n<em>Do you trust Me?<br />\nDoes your faith in Me extend to the life of your daughter?<br />\nDoes your love for Me go that far?</em></p>\n\n<p>&lt;Gulp&gt;</p>\n\n<p><em>Yes, Lord.&nbsp; I trust You.</em></p>\n\n<p>Through that circumstance, the Lord increased my faith and drew me closer to Him than I had been in a long time.&nbsp; I was joyful at the nearness of His presence and at the healing He performed in my daughter.&nbsp; She is doing well and continues her recovery after the surgery.&nbsp; Praise His Name!</p>\n\n<p>As G-d served up that bit of faith and I found that it was good, I thought to myself, \"May I have more, please?\"</p>\n\n<p>Whoops!</p>\n\n<p>I had forgotten that the testing of our faith builds endurance.&nbsp; Apparently, my endurance training wasn&rsquo;t finished yet.</p>\n\n<p>This week, my wife also had to have surgery and as I was brought back to that humbling place of fearful reverence before G-d, I felt the same questions upon my heart:<br />\n<br />\n<em>Do you trust Me?<br />\nDoes your faith in Me extend to the life of your precious bride?<br />\nDoes your love for me extend that far?</em></p>\n\n<p>&lt;Gulp&gt; (again)</p>\n\n<p><em>Yes, Lord.&nbsp; I trust You.</em></p>\n\n<p>This time, however, I found it easier to trust Him.&nbsp; It was not quite as frightening because I <strong>knew </strong>G-d in a way that I hadn&rsquo;t known Him before.&nbsp; As Solomon said, \"the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.\"</p>\n\n<p>Like repeatedly running a mile builds our endurance physically, repeatedly having our faith in G-d tested and drawing near to Him builds our endurance spiritually.&nbsp; Maybe James was right and we should consider such testing pure joy.</p>\n\n<p>Having tasted and seen that the LORD is good (Psalm 34:8), I find myself (cautiously!) thinking again,</p>\n\n<p>\"May I have more, please?\"</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

                 "body": "<p>We stood in the garage of one neighbor&rsquo;s house at 5:50 this morning and watched the other neighbor&rsquo;s house burn down. The family &ndash; two parents, three kids, and one very traumatized beagle &ndash; stood lined up across the front of the garage peering through the rain, watching as all their accumulated earthly wealth burned. It gave new meaning to the scriptures. It all burns. These are the castles we build while we&rsquo;re here. These are the efforts that drive our days and haunt our nights. This. This, that smolders even now hours later as we look out the windows from our comfortable home across the street and think about having no silverware. No shoes. No keys to start the car with. No charger for our phones. It all seems so important, so vital to our existence. And you know what&hellip; it is. For now. But this is not our home.</p>\n\n<p>This morning I stood with my arms around young Delaney and wondered if this family has laid up treasure in heaven. I wondered if they were counting that even then as they counted their earthly losses. I wondered. But I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve been wasting my time building my little kingdom across the street, watching detached as they built theirs over on the hill. They have a boat that we secretly call the &ldquo;S.S. Minnow&rdquo; and a dog named Tess, but until this morning, I didn&rsquo;t know the mom&rsquo;s name &ndash; Marcy. We&rsquo;ve been neighbors for 8 years.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Fire.jpg\" style=\"opacity: 0.9; width: 200px; height: 267px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 10px 5px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>I feel completely helpless and full of regret and it&rsquo;s my own fault. If I had made my home their home long before now, they wouldn&rsquo;t be standing in the other neighbor&rsquo;s garage; they&rsquo;d be sitting at my kitchen table. Maybe we&rsquo;d be praying together and sharing the hope of heaven. Or maybe we&rsquo;d just be sharing safe, familiar surroundings as the shock sets in. Instead, all my family can do is offer our help as strangers and detached neighbors do: with genuine concern, but without the relationship to back it up. And I am immeasurably sad.</p>\n\n<p>Everything that was important in that house stood in the garage with us this morning. That is truth. They are the souls that could easily have perished had one neighbor not been up early leaving the house before dawn. For now, I can share the clothes out of our closets with the living, but that is a small thing compared to what I could have been doing to clothe what is imperishable with the hope of glory. For you, today, ask yourself and ask the Lord where and how you can be better prepared than I was to say, &ldquo;It will be OK&rdquo; and know that it will because you know, and you know that they know, that this may be their house, but this is not their home.</p>"

You can use this analogy to remember that&nbsp; \"manumit\" derives ultimately from the Latin noun \"manus,\" meaning \"hand\", plus&nbsp; the Latin verb \"mittere,\" meaning \"to let go\" or \"send.\" The two roots joined&nbsp; hands in Latin to form the verb \"manumittere\" (meaning \"to free from slavery\"),&nbsp; which in turn passed into Anglo-French as \"manumettre\" and eventually into&nbsp; Middle English as \"manumitten.\" \"Manus\" has handed down other words to English&nbsp; as well. One of them is \"emancipate,\" which is both a relative and synonym of&nbsp; \"manumit.\"</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This brings to mind several passages of Scripture:</p>\n\n<h6>\"Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, &#39;I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.&nbsp; (Exodus 6:6)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We see in the book of Exodus that G-d does, indeed, <strong>manumit </strong>the Israelites from their physical bondage in Egypt and later we see this:</p>\n\n<h6>&#39;You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God brought you out of there by a <strong>mighty hand </strong>and by an outstretched arm...&#39; (Deuteronomy 5:15)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Paul tells us in the book of Romans that we are \"sold into bondage to sin\".</p>\n\n<h6>For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin.&nbsp; (Romans 7:14)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>He later asks who will grant him <strong>manumission:</strong></p>\n\n<h6>Wretched man that I am! Who will <strong>set me free </strong>from the body of this death?&nbsp; Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! (Romans 7:24-25)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We are freed from bondage to sin and made into bond-servants of G-d:</p>\n\n<h6>But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life. (Romans 6:22)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To the One who has bought us with a great price, justified us, and is sanctifying us be the glory, honor, and praise forever!&nbsp; Amen.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

That&#39;s the full message&nbsp;Paul declared to be&nbsp;the power of G-d for salvation (Romans 1:16)?&nbsp;<em>That&#39;s </em>the power of G-d?? Hardly.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">McKnight makes a case that 80% of children who grew up in evangelical homes are walking away from their faith <em>because</em> they lack the true gospel. They weren&#39;t exposed to the full word of God. They heard the personal message of salvation but nothing more.</span></p>\n\n<p>Four men who lived in the first century wrote entire books on the subject of the Gospel.&nbsp;They were eyewitnesses (or spoke with eyewitnesses) to the life and work of Christ.&nbsp;We know these books as the Gospel according to Matthew, the Gospel according to Mark, the <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_luke\">Gospel according to Luke</a>, and the <a href=\"/bible-studies/the-gospel-of-john\">Gospel according to John</a>.&nbsp;These books have 16-28 chapters each, some of which contain 50+ verses on the subject. No summarized, distilled&nbsp;version of their contents can&nbsp;substitute for an abiding, intimate&nbsp;knowledge of the same.</p>\n\n<p>If we must have distilled \"gospels,\" then maybe&nbsp;Author D. Thomas Lancaster&#39;s&nbsp;paraphrase of Peter&rsquo;s sermon in Acts 2 (and other passages) is a better summary of the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; Gospel message:</p>\n\n<h6 style=\"margin-left: 30px;\"><em>Repent, because the Messianic Age is near.&nbsp; How near is it?&nbsp; So near that the Messiah has already been identified: Jesus of Nazareth, a son of David attested to by G-d with mighty works and wonders and signs that G-d did through him.&nbsp; He was delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of G-d, crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men, but G-d raised him up, loosing him from the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by death.</em>&nbsp; (Acts 2:22-24)&nbsp; <em>He has ascended to the right hand of the Father, and having received the Holy Spirit, has poured it out upon his disciples.</em>(v 33)&nbsp; <em>Therefore, repent from your sins, turn to G-d, be immersed for the name of Jesus the King to become his disciple, and you will receive the forgiveness of your sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit.</em>(v 38) <em>When he comes again, he will bring the Messianic Era and establish the kingdom of heaven and everything that it entails.&nbsp; He will defeat the enemies of Israel,</em> (v 35)&nbsp;<em>bring an end to the exile of the Jewish people, and restore the kingdom to Israel, just as the prophets predicted.&nbsp; At that time, G-d will raise his disciples from the dead to join him,</em> (Acts 24:15) <em>just as he raised Jesus from the dead.&nbsp; After the kingdom, then comes the final judgment, when every person who ever lived must stand before the throne of judgment.&nbsp; </em>(Acts 24:25) <em>The names of those who have obeyed King Jesus and trusted him for the forgiveness of their sins are recorded in the Book of Life along with the names of the saints.</em> (Rev 20:12)&nbsp; <em>This promise is for Jewish people and for their children and for all who are far off, for everyone whom the LORD our G-d calls to Himself.</em> (Acts 2:39)<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Now </span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">THAT </strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">is good news: the Kingdom of G-d is almost here!&nbsp;It is so close that we can </span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">see the King</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">!</span></p>\n\n<p>McKnight notes that one of our challenges in the 21st century can be summed up in a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche: &ldquo;The text has disappeared under the interpretation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Because we have equated the &ldquo;message of personal salvation&rdquo; with &ldquo;the gospel&rdquo; for so long, the term Gospel&nbsp;has lost its true meaning in the church. We need to remind each other to study and know the full Gospel if we are to be prepared to live out our faith &ndash; or even to remain faithful to it!</p>\n\n<p>If we are to have a solid foundation for our faith (and for the faith of our children!) then we need to have the full gospel and walk confidently&nbsp;on the path of faith that leads to salvation.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"/about/\">VBVMI</a> is here to help you every step of the way!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

                 "body": "<p>~My husband is the only person I know who uses a lint roller on the insides of his pockets. I caught him doing it this morning. It just troubles him to have all that build-up in there. He asked me with his face wrinkled in disgust, &ldquo;What is it? And where does it come from?&rdquo;&nbsp; I had just finished saying to him that I was about to go feel bad about myself again as I make my way through my current Bible study. My trouble with the content of God&rsquo;s teaching is similar to my husband&rsquo;s lint quandary: the more I learn about what God desires for me and from me, the more aware I am of deep pockets of crud that exist well-hidden in my soul. I don&rsquo;t know where it came from but now that I&rsquo;m aware of its presence, I have to deal with it.</p>\n\n<p>There are some similarities in the solution to pocket lint and soul crud, beginning, of course, with awareness. God has made me aware of some areas of my life that need a closer look, so, like a pocket, I have to reach in to those areas and turn them inside out to get an idea of just what&rsquo;s hiding in there. This is the disgusting part. The part that makes you wrinkle your nose and curl your lip and feel really bad about your housekeeping. While pocket lint is indeed gross, it&rsquo;s mostly harmless. Sin, however, will kill you (or ruin the life you&rsquo;ve been given on this side of eternity and steal your eternal reward&hellip;but who&rsquo;s splitting hairs??). You will be shocked speechless when God gives you eyes to see what&rsquo;s been amassing in the dark while you have been blissfully going about your business unaware.</p>\n\n<p>Step two involves picking out the big chunks: the stuff that has glommed together at the seams and formed a clot that clings to the corners. It sometimes becomes enmeshed with the fibers of the cloth to the point where it has to be trimmed off with scissors. This stuff has been here <em><strong>awhile</strong></em>, folks! It&rsquo;s about time you took a peek in here! In a pocket, this clump is no big deal, but when you&rsquo;ve got to surgically remove sin that has accumulated, gathered reinforcements, and become enmeshed in your life &ndash; woven into the very fabric of your being &ndash; it can be very painful to remove, and one quick snip is usually not enough to handle it effectively. It may be necessary to air that laundry in public to get some accountability. Let that pocket hang out with its insides showing. That&rsquo;s a nice way of saying that you need to get someone else&rsquo;s eyes on your ugliness. Someone who will tell you how ugly it is. This is the only way to prevent further buildup in that area.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you could pick at what&rsquo;s left and deal with it one speck at a time like you would if you just had a few flecks of fluff on your shirt, but there&rsquo;s <em><strong>a lot </strong></em>of lint in here. You couldn&rsquo;t get it all if you picked at it for a year, and in the meantime, more would collect. This is the nature of sin. There&rsquo;s a bunch of it, lots of &lsquo;little stuff&rsquo;, and it seems to repopulate while we&rsquo;re busy dealing with what was there when we first looked. We need something more effective than our own ability to single out the miniscule specks of buildup. We need a savior. He is the only answer to the problem of sin.</p>\n\n<p>We are not in the habit of examining the hidden places of our lives, as we should. I laugh at my husband because he turns his pockets inside out to clean them, but what I should do is thank him for the great example. The more we look at those places we least expect to find crud build up, the more aware we are of the fact that sin is unconquerable. No matter how hard we ARE TRYING to conquer it, there will always be stuff in the corners that we don&rsquo;t see, or thought we could live with, or just ignored &ndash; out of sight out of mind. While it may be out of <em><strong>our</strong></em> sight, out of <em><strong>our </strong></em>mind, it is never hidden from God. We need a more effective remedy. We need Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, Lord, to equate you with so common a household tool as a lint-roller, but I am grateful beyond words that you are effective against the crud in my life. In one giant swipe, you made it stick to yourself and you took it all away. Please remind me to turn things inside out once in a while and take care of what I can, but in recognizing the futility of my efforts, to praise you with all I have. You have made me clean in the inmost places.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>When I was sixteen, I had my own portrait made as a gift for my mother for Christmas. (I know, right? I&rsquo;ll just give you a moment with that little nugget of truth about me.) She was underwhelmed. I now own that portrait. It never went on display while I lived at home, but was placed, instead, in the &ldquo;picture drawer&rdquo; for safekeeping. It was a very expensive unappreciated gift.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know why that photo crossed my mind the other day, but it was on the heels of being unappreciative myself. I was thinking about something that really irked me&hellip;OK&hellip;it was actually some<em><strong>one</strong></em>&hellip;I know you&rsquo;re surprised&hellip;and that portrait just popped into my mind. Maybe because of the pain. It is painful to give a gift that is not appreciated. And yet, here is this person in my life, whom God has obviously given me, and I am less than underwhelmed: I am ungrateful.</p>\n\n<p>I am ungrateful for the aggravation they cause me. I don&rsquo;t enjoy our frustrating attempts at communication. Their strange and annoying personal habits leave me exasperated. I want them to go away, mostly. Out of sight&hellip;out of sight!! (Yes. I meant that twice!)</p>\n\n<p>Do you have people like this, or is it just me? Or maybe it&rsquo;s not a people, but a job, a car, a noisy refrigerator. Do you ever think about your annoyances as gifts? Do you ever have this conversation with yourself, &ldquo;Well, Melissa, you should be <em><strong>glad</strong></em> to have this person in your life. It&rsquo;s not like beggars can be choosey!&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Thank God I <em><strong>have</strong></em> a refrigerator, even if it does sound like a 747 landing in the kitchen. I could be traipsing down to the creek bed to fish out my yogurt.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You could even go so far as to recognize that nothing, absolutely nothing, enters your life without the express permission of God for the purpose of making you more like His son. That means my maddening person is there to do exactly what they&rsquo;re doing&hellip;working my <em><strong>last living nerve</strong></em>&hellip;so that I can learn to be long-suffering, kind, loving, gentle, and confident in Christ that when I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson He will take them away. Wait. Maybe not that part. Sigh.</p>\n\n<p>It might also mean that as the deliveryman who has just installed your brand-new stainless steel refrigerator leaves your driveway, you remember to enquire about where that old jetliner you just chucked can be donated. Whether or not you could find it in <em><strong>your </strong></em>soul to be grateful for it&hellip;<em><strong>someone</strong></em> can, and you can at least appreciate the value of the gift.</p>\n\n<p>Yes. This is a count-your-blessings post. But I needed it. Maybe you did too. It&rsquo;s a short walk to find reasons to be grateful for even a lousy job and a jalopy of a car, but there are some things in our lives that are harder to appreciate. Illness. The price of sending a kid to college. Aging parents. Singleness. But then you could stop to consider the cost to Christ to make us His own, and then to maneuver our circumstances and orchestrate our days in ways designed to make us holy. Maybe remembering that even an unwelcome gift incurs a cost and is an act of sincere kindness born of love could help us appreciate the gifts that hurt just a little. Or irritate a whole lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consider it all joy, my brethern, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in&nbsp;nothing. James 1:2-4 &nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>Recently, I saw an irreverent bumper sticker that read: <em>Jesus saves...you should invest.</em></p>\n\n<p>Overlooking the disrespectful tone, I was struck by the unintended Biblical truth of this statement: <em>Jesus saved us, so we are free to invest in God and eternity.</em></p>\n\n<p>Many of us know the frustration of struggling financially, working hard in our jobs yet falling further behind financially. Living paycheck-to-paycheck leaves no room for emergency expenses, leading many to borrow to cover the shortfall. We&#39;re so burdened by yesterday&#39;s obligations that we can&#39;t consider tomorrow&#39;s opportunities,&nbsp;and we lack the resources to invest in our future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This same pattern holds true in our relationship to God. Before we knew the Lord and were saved by our faith in Christ, we were living paycheck-to-paycheck, spirtually speaking. Like all unbelievers, we assumed we must earn our entrance into Heaven (if we gave any thought to our eternal destiny).</p>\n\n<p>Our spiritual focus was the here and now, as we worked to atone for our sin and improve our \"karma\" by performing \"good works\" for God. Inevitably, we slipped up or gave into temptation, increasing our \"debt\" and setting back our spiritual progress.</p>\n\n<p>This hand-to-mouth approach of earning spiritual credit could never give us an assurance of salvation, because each day brought new failures, more guilt and an ever-present fear we would come up short on our judgment day. Investing in eternity was never a consideration, since we were too busy paying off our debts.</p>\n\n<p>Now, consider how the Lord changed our spiritual finances. By living a sinless life and dying on the cross in our place, Jesus has completed <em>all</em> the work required to save us from the penalty of our sins.</p>\n\n<p>As Paul wrote:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 4:4&nbsp; Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.<br />\nRom. 4:5&nbsp; But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Our debt before God has been paid in full by the work of Christ on our behalf. Since our debt has been paid, we are no longer required to pay it ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if a rich relative offered to pay all your bills and expenses - including all your future bills. How would such a gracious gift change your priorities in life? The time you previously used earning a living to pay those bills suddenly becomes available for other pursuits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>LIkewise, when Jesus paid our sin debt on the cross, He freed us to pursue other spiritual goals.</p>\n\n<p>Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 6:20&nbsp; For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Biblically speaking, Christians are expected to use their days on earth to invest in a spiritual future. We do not perform our good works to obtain or secure our salvation; Christ has already completed the work of salvation on the cross.&nbsp; Therefore, we are free to invest our time in glorfying the Lord with our bodies and building up others in the Church.</p>\n\n<p>By these investments, we store up treasure for ourselves in Heaven. Paul instructed Timothy to teach this principle to the Church:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 6:18&nbsp; Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,<br />\n1Tim. 6:19&nbsp; storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>We must seek to become rich in good works, for by these works we store up for ourselves a good foundation. This foundation is our future life in eternity, the true life we should seek and build.</p>\n\n<p>Because Jesus saved us, we can invest in our spiritual future. Let&#39;s invest together!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> If you&#39;re interested in learning more about the Bible&#39;s teaching on investing for your spiritual future, please listen to parts 1 and 2 of <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_sovereignty_of_god/the_love_of_money_part_1/\"><strong>The Love of Money</strong></a>, from our teaching series on the <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_sovereignty_of_god/\"><strong>Sovereignty of God</strong></a>.</em></p>"

                 "body": "<p>By Helen Norvell</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It has been a couple months since I&rsquo;ve written anything, so I&rsquo;m going to start by sharing&nbsp;a bit of personal information. I have poor health and I live daily in moderate to severe pain. Most of the time I try to not let it get me down, but sometimes it does. I go into my dark place and have myself a good old pity party. I do try very hard to keep others from knowing about it, but you can&rsquo;t hide anything from God. In these times, I still know who to go to for help. I look in the word of God. Just as Elijah has his pity party with God in attendance, so do I.</span></p>\n\n<p>I start with Ecclesiastes. There are some very good lessons to be learned here. Life is very short; just a vapor really. It&rsquo;s what we do with the time the Lord has given us that matters. What we do for the Lord counts. Anything else we may put our minds and hearts into is futile. It&rsquo;s seems to me that Solomon spent his time on a lot of futile endeavors. Whether good or bad, all will be revealed in the end. So love the Lord and keep His commandments. Live for the Lord now. Use the gifts He has given you for His glory now, before the vapor goes up in a poof. This is all good but it sounds like Solomon is as depressed as I am.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m still in my dark place, feeling sorry for myself. I realize I have to shake this off. I need something to lift my spirits. I need a good laugh.</p>\n\n<p>Does God have a sense of humor? I began to meditate on some of my favorite stories in The Bible. My warning, these I find funny. These are some of the best stories in the Word with wonderful pictures and God&rsquo;s sovereignty, righteousness and so much more. In telling these, I want you to see how God gave me what I needed, when I needed it.</p>\n\n<p>So I started reading the story of Moses and the burning bush.</p>\n\n<h5><em>Exodus 4: 2-4</em></h5>\n\n<h5><em>&ldquo;Then the Lord said to him, &lsquo;What is that in your hand?&rsquo;</em></h5>\n\n<h5><em>&ldquo;A staff,&rdquo; he replied.</em></h5>\n\n<h5><em>The Lord said, &ldquo;Throw it on the ground.&rdquo;</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><em>Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it. 4&nbsp;Then the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Reach out your hand and take it by the tail.&rdquo; So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>If there is one thing in this world I am more afraid of than anything else, it&rsquo;s a SNAKE. The only good snake is a dead snake! I put myself into the story as you will see. If my staff had turned into a SNAKE, I would have been off that mountain, across the field, in the tent, and hiding behind Zipporah for protection, in the twinkling of an eye. I got chased by a black racer as a child. No snake is going to catch me! Truly, the Lord would have had to drag me kicking and screaming back up that mountain. Then He tells Moses to pick it up (at least He said by the tail). I would have been begging and pleading. &ldquo;Please Lord Jesus, No!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So you can see, right? I put myself in the story. I can just imagine how I would react. This makes me laugh and the darkness is not quite so dark now. I&rsquo;m not out yet so on I go.</span></p>\n\n<p>I always loved the story of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into a blazing furnace because they would not bow down and worship a statue of him. He bound them hand and foot and threw them into the furnace.</p>\n\n<h5><em>Daniel 3: 24-25 - Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astounded and stood up in haste; he said to his high officials, &ldquo;Was it not three men we cast bound into the midst of the fire?&rdquo; They replied to the king, &ldquo;Certainly, O king.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Look! I see four men loosed and walking about in the midst of the fire without harm, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods!&rdquo;</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>There I am in the midst of them. I&rsquo;m watching Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s face. Ha, Ha, what do you think of that O king? I am so proud of my Lord. I laugh and laugh at the astonished looks on their faces. The darkness is getting lighter and lighter.</p>\n\n<p>Now I go to one of my all-time favorites. It&rsquo;s found in 1 Samuel chapters 4-7. I don&rsquo;t have the space to write out the whole story so I&rsquo;ll just give you an overview. This is when the Philistines steal the Ark of the Covenant from the Israelites. The Philistines are fighting the Israelites at Ebenezer. They thrash Israel. Israel brings the Ark of the Lord into the camp. When the Philistines come back after Israel again, they defeat them and steal the Ark. Huge Mistake! It&rsquo;s not as if they don&rsquo;t know what the Ark is; 1Samuel 4:7- The Philistines were afraid, for they said, &ldquo;God has come into the camp.&rdquo; And they said &ldquo;Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before. They knew what God had done to the Egyptians. Now I ask you, why would you take the Ark? I can tell you, God did not like their actions. God decides to show them some of His power. From Ebenezer to Ekron God passes judgment.</p>\n\n<p>He strikes the Philistines with hemorrhoids or tumors if you prefer. You have heard of &ldquo;hit them where it hurts&rdquo;! He also strikes them with confusion so they are killing one another. Shouldn&rsquo;t have taken the Ark! So, from Ebenezer, Aphek, Ashdod, God is judging these Philistines. What is so funny to me is Ashdod. Can you believe the pagan people put the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD in the temple of their idol Dagon? Really, are you crazy? They do put it there and the next morning they find their &ldquo;god&rdquo; on his face before The Ark. Ha, ha! Then they set their &ldquo;god&rdquo; back in his place. You can actually do that with your &ldquo;god&rdquo;? The next morning, good old Dagon is on the floor again. This time his hands and feet are cut off on the threshold of the house of Dagon. Oh my goodness, this cracks me up! These Philistines want to get rid of The Ark, (wonder why?) They send the Ark on to Gath and God strikes them with the tumors and confusion. They send the Ark to Ekron where they find out how to send The Ark of the Lord home. They make five golden tumors and five golden mice as guilt offerings to God. They make a new cart and hitch it to two nursing cows. They set the Ark on the cart and set the five golden tumors and five golden mice in a box beside the Ark and send it home. Whew! I laugh and laugh every time I read this story.</p>\n\n<p>The darkness has passed and I am in the light.&#8232;As my Mother used to tell me, there is always someone worse off than you are. Be thankful. I haven&rsquo;t been thrown into a blazing furnace, or had to pick up snakes, or put in a lion&rsquo;s den.&#8232;As for Dagon, I can&rsquo;t help but remember a verse in Romans.</p>\n\n<h5><em>Romans 14:11 - &ldquo;&lsquo;As surely as I live,&rsquo; says the Lord,&#8232;&lsquo;every knee will bow before me;&#8232;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every tongue will acknowledge God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul had a thorn in his side. God chose to leave it there. Perhaps it is the same for me. Either way, God&rsquo;s grace is sufficient for me. His Word has the answer for all life&rsquo;s problems, great and small.</p>\n\n<p>We are not of the darkness but of the Light.</p>"

The \"<em>kippur</em>\"/atonement offerings are literally the ransom or price of ritual cleansing... and that ransom involves blood.</p>\n\n<p>In Leviticus 14:52 the blood of a bird is used to cleanse a house with \"leprosy\":</p>\n\n<h6>To <span style=\"color: rgb(153, 51, 34); font-weight: bold;\">cleanse </span>the house then, he shall take two birds and cedar wood and a scarlet string and hyssop, and he shall slaughter the one bird in an earthenware vessel over running water.

You shall present them before the Lord, and the priests shall throw salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to the Lord. For seven days you shall prepare daily a goat for a sin offering; also a young bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be prepared.

When they have completed the days, it shall be that on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you,&#39; declares the Lord God.\" (Ezekiel 43:18-27)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The apostolic affirmation of this \"atonement = cleansing\" concept is found in Hebrews chapter 9:</p>\n\n<h6>But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation; and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption. <span style=\"color: rgb(153, 51, 34); font-weight: bold;\">For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the <u>cleansing of the flesh</u></span>, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? (Hebrews 9:11-14)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The author of Hebrews <em>affirms </em>that the blood of goats and bulls (and the ashes of the red heifer) cleanses the <strong>flesh </strong>and then uses that truth in a lesser-to-greater (Latin:&nbsp;<em>a fortiori </em>, Hebrew: <em>kal va-chomer</em>) argument to prove \"how much more\" the blood of Christ cleanses our <strong>conscience</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the former is true then the latter is much more!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One final thought: although the Hebrew words for atoning or atonement are used over 100 times in the Old Testament, the words \"atone\", \"atoning\", or \"atonement\" are never found in the NASB translation of the New Testament. The Greek word used in the Septuagint for \"atoning\" (<em>hilaskomai</em>) is only used twice: by the publican in Luke 18:13 and in Hebrews 2:17 where it is (inaccurately in my opinion) translated into English as \"propitiation\" (an appeasement).</p>\n\n<p>Scripture never says that Messiah <strong>is </strong>our atonement. It says He <strong>made </strong>atonement... with His own blood.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Blessed be His precious Name!</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

I can&rsquo;t pray for him. It isn&rsquo;t that I can&rsquo;t think of words to say, requests to make, hopes to lift up, but rather, when I pray it&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;m in a Teflon pot with the lid on. I know you all have heard the expression that your prayers are bouncing off the ceiling. This is not that. This is the feeling of utter isolation. I can hear nothing. I can feel nothing. I have no sense of direction in this complete darkness. I feel removed from the process. I speak but no sound comes &ndash; my words simply slip&nbsp;down the Teflon walls&nbsp;that surround&nbsp;me and pile up at my feet ineffectually. I am powerless, hushed into silence. A bystander. An audience.</p>\n\n<p>I confessed this feeling of helplessness to Wil the other night, and as I did, I understood in that moment that this is entirely by God&rsquo;s design. (Here&rsquo;s where I fling a plethora of clich&eacute;s at the situation to make my point.) For Wil, this is where the rubber meets the road, where God separates the man from the boy, where Wil must choose his fork in the road. And I can do nothing to affect his course. This one is between him and God, and God clearly does not desire my intervention.</p>\n\n<p>In the November 15th entry of <u>My Utmost for His Highest</u>, Oswald Chambers writes:<em> &ldquo;One of our severest lessons comes from the stubborn refusal to see that we must not interfere in other people&rsquo;s lives. It takes a long time to realize the danger of being an amateur providence, that is, interfering with God&rsquo;s order for others. You see a certain person suffering, and you say &ndash; &#39;He shall not suffer, and I will see that he does not.&#39; You put your hand straight in front of God&rsquo;s permissive will to prevent it&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;If there is stagnation spiritually&hellip;possibly you will find it is because you have been interfering&hellip; proposing things you had no right to propose; advising when you had no right to advise.&rdquo;</em> This is where I find myself, and I thank God that He has paid no heed to my foolish prayers. But I thank Him on trembling knees. Because this is my boy. But he&rsquo;s becoming a man &ndash; God&rsquo;s man. And there comes a point where I must let go of him and leave Him to God. This is that point. And I am terrified.</p>\n\n<p>I know it seems right that we should interpose, intercede, and intervene, but that presumes that we know better than God, and that He is not sovereign in the circumstances. We pray as if He needs to know what&rsquo;s going on here. As if He is not aware. As if He has taken His hands off the wheel. As if He is merely awaiting our command to act before He releases His power on the situation. We do not pray in surrendered submission, admitting that nothing comes to us but through His will to allow it or purpose it. We pray instead in a fevered panic. We do not know how to pray, &ldquo;thy will be done&rdquo; and mean it, because the possible consequences are too terrifying, too painful, too permanent.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve resolved to do while in this Telflon&nbsp;pot. I will continue to pray. I will practice praying until I have found the right alignment with the Spirit, the right words of agreement, my right place as an intercessor against evil&hellip;not an interferer in God&rsquo;s work. I will know I have found the right place when the lid is lifted and the floodwaters of scripture wash over me; when my words&hellip;His words&hellip;become the power to bring about His will. I will learn to go<em><strong> with </strong></em>the Lord <em><strong>for </strong></em>my son and not to go <em><strong>between</strong></em> the Lord and my son. And as much as it is within my ability, I will pray with the understanding that this man-child is only on loan to me and at some point I must surrender him to his Father, entirely like Abraham surrendered Isaac. He is God&rsquo;s. The best I can pray for Him is for God&rsquo;s good eternal purpose to complete its work in him &ndash; no matter how much I might want to save him from the pain of the process. And I will pray that the Lord will give me strength not to lose heart, not to grow weary, not to wobble in my faith lest I find myself back in the pot with the lid on.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>As a teenager growing up, I remember my parents&#39; frequent complaining over my need for instant gratification. They counseled me on the importance of self-discipline and delayed satisfaction, and they warned of the dangers of imprudence and impatience. Naturally, I responded the way most teenagers do...I ignored my parents and took (nearly) every opportunity to indulge my flesh.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Christian Vices: Instant Gratification\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/microwave-oven-old-school1.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 20px; width: 314px; height: 248px;\" />How was I supposed to avoid the temptation of instant gratification? Growing up in the 1970s and early 1980s, I witnessed the dawning of the \"now\" society. I can still remember the day my parents brought home our first microwave oven. We marveled at the prospect of defrosting hotdogs in seconds and cooking entire meals in less time than it took to set the table. Instant gratification never tasted so good!</p>\n\n<p>Soon cable TV, the VCR, cordless phones and self-correcting typewriters followed, and they ushered in the generation of quick and easy. Why wait for anything when technology could fill every need instantly?</p>\n\n<p>Today, instant gratification is no longer considered a vice for Christians &ndash; it&#39;s become a lifestyle! Technology delivers to us immeasurable quantities of information in a instant, while distributing our most private thoughts to a worldwide audience of strangers. Modern medicine seems capable of curing every ailment in just 24-48 hours, and instant credit has brought the world&#39;s treasures within everyone&#39;s financial reach.</p>\n\n<p>Having become a parent myself, I can better appreciate my parents&#39; wisdom, and so now I&#39;m the one counseling my own children to practice patience and self-discipline in a world of instant messaging, cell phones and downloadable everything. Even now I still battle a desire for the \"quick and easy\" solution to every situation, but I&#39;m learning that quick and easy isn&#39;t always best.</p>\n\n<p>For example, an instant gratification lifestyle can have a detrimental impact on our Christian walk, leading us to depend upon quick and easy solutions to otherwise difficult spiritual problems. Instead of regular prayer and waiting on the Lord, we launch urgent church campaigns and deliver impassioned calls to action. The practices of daily devotionals and seeking godly counsel from our church elders give way to 40-day programs and an intense marriage retreat weekend. Life-long Bible scholarship can&#39;t compete with 7-week discipleship programs or the latest bestseller from some popular preacher. Welcome to instant gratification discipleship in the 21st century!</p>\n\n<p>When we seek an instant gratification approach to our Christian walk, we will inevitably grow frustrated as our efforts to produce spiritual fruit take longer than we expected or desired. Frustration leads to discouragement, and ultimately we may abandon the basic disciplines of the Christian faith. Conditioned to believe every good thing is quick and easy, we may rationalize our poor spiritual disciplines with thoughts like, \"Prayer takes too long to see results, studying the Bible is so boring, and fasting just isn&#39;t good for my metabolism.\" We may live in the age of instant gratification, but there is no such thing as instant <em>sanctification</em> this side of heaven.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, Scripture counsels us to be patient no fewer than 25 times in the New Testament, and it&#39;s a theme featured prominently in much of Paul&#39;s writing. For example, his famous discourse on love in 1Corinthians 13 begins, \"Love is patient...\" In Galatians, Paul lists patience as a fruit of the Spirit, and Paul repeatedly exhorts the church to follow his example of patience in suffering and trials.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, a mature Christian walk should be marked by patience, particularly in spiritual matters. While the world preaches \"now,\" we are counseled by Scripture to look beyond the here and now and choose to live for an eternal purpose. We are to devote ourselves to a life of discipleship, knowing that these disciplines produce fruit in time and in direct proportion to our patience and diligence.&nbsp; Pray, study your Bible, seek godly counsel and serve in your gift with an eye for eternity, and you will find the fruit of your patience in eternal reward.</p>\n\n<p>Our parents were right: patience is a virtue, which is why I pray the Lord would give me patience...but give it to me <em><strong>now</strong></em>!</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~My son has been through a&nbsp;rough time lately. For the first time in his young life he has experienced grievous betrayal. The &ldquo;Et tu Brute?&rdquo; kind of betrayal that can only come from a trusted friend. We&rsquo;ve been through the mill of emotions &ndash; my family and I. I have not weathered it well. I know all the right things to say, but actually being an example of what I know is another thing altogether. I know all that God expects from him - from us - in the situation, but modeling that is a tall order. We want justice, but there is no penalty to impose. We want full confession, but none is forthcoming. We want repentance, but there is no brokenness. We want to forgive, but we feel cheated of a reason to do so.</p>\n\n<p>In working through the emotions, the expectations, and the experience of it all I have learned some things about being on both sides of this coin, because, you see, I am all too aware of having been the betrayer as often as I have been the betrayed. (See: Gum on the Bottom of God&rsquo;s Shoe)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I know about being the betrayer. Apologies don&rsquo;t work. Apologies are easy, and usually meaningless. An apology is not brokenness and repentance, it is not ownership of the deed, it is an excuse for the purpose of appeasement. True brokenness and repentance finds us nearly groveling, from the vantage point of a worm.&nbsp; We must own what we have done to the other person, to the relationship, to our own soul, and to God&rsquo;s law of love. Real repentance pours from the desperate awareness that despite our best attempts, we are likely to repeat the sin because we are just that heinous. And brokenness realizes that there is no good reason for the other person to offer what we so desperately need: forgiveness, restoration, release. We don&rsquo;t often allow ourselves the painful experience of true brokenness, but that doesn&rsquo;t prevent us from attempting appeasement while hoping for forgiveness.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I know about being the one betrayed. Nothing but brokenness and true repentance can bring about true forgiveness (from a human standpoint). Without the intervention of the Holy Spirit we are without the capacity to let someone off the hook unless they grovel like said worm. Heaven help us.</p>\n\n<p>My son and his betrayer discussed the situation, but my son did not find brokenness and repentance in the partial confession that was offered. He found, instead, excuses and blame and an attempt at appeasement. It was unsatisfying and unfair, and still he offered at least the lip service of forgiveness. But I&rsquo;m not sure that made its way to his heart. There is still no balm for his wound. There is no treatment for the injury. There is no restitution for the debt. There is no punishment&hellip;no balancing of the scales. He wants it to hurt as much to receive forgiveness as it does to give it. This is the way we are. There&rsquo;s just one problem.&nbsp; Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>In seeking our own satisfaction, and by clinging to our rights to see justice done, we fail too often to realize that there was a punishment for our betrayer&rsquo;s sin, but it was not levied against them. It was placed on and endured by Christ. We want the person who hurt us to be the one to suffer (and let&rsquo;s be honest&hellip;we want to <em><strong>see</strong></em> it!), but Christ already did that for them. The difficult thing about Christian forgiveness is staying in the awareness that really, sin is against God first, and Jesus has already accomplished restoration. Offering another person forgiveness simply acknowledges that the requirements&nbsp;of justice have been met, our betrayer is already forgiven, and we forfeit the right to demand further payment for their sin. Jesus paid it all. And we must be satisfied with that.</p>\n\n<p>There is a saying that we find grace to be unfair until we are the ones who need it. In learning to offer forgiveness we must first remember that our own betrayal has been forgiven. On either side of the coin that is forgiveness &ndash; offering it or receiving it &ndash; is simply God inviting us to experience Him more fully. We are granted the opportunity to realize who we are in His sight: a worm, but a worm who is well and truly loved and&nbsp;forgiven.&nbsp;Alternately we are offered the privilege of being a vessel for pouring out on another undeserving worm the forgiveness we ourselves&nbsp;have received, while rejoicing in the understanding of how ridiculously unfair it is that we have been forgiven&hellip;and they should be forgiven. We are ushered to the throne hand in hand, at once the betrayer and the betrayed, forgiven and forgiving, humbled but lifted up. This is what it is to live a life of forgiveness.

                 "body": "<p>~~I did something bad. I took advantage of someone who extended kindness and trust to me. I did it <em><strong>knowing</strong></em> that if she ever found out, she would forgive me. I weighed and measured other ways to get what I wanted in the situation and found this to be the option with the least painful outcome even if I got busted (HA! Little did I know.)</p>\n\n<p>Are you measuring the depths of that sin? There is no way to quantify the depravity, let me assure you. Having peered into the blackness of that crevasse, I can tell you that only the Lord can fathom it.</p>\n\n<p>In God&rsquo;s way, He would not allow me to have a minute&rsquo;s peace with my sin. Like a thorn in my flesh, it festered and boiled and made me sick. I confessed to Him and promised repentance, and finding <em>His</em> forgiveness was easy. Finding <em>hers </em>would be something altogether different - not because she would be loathe to give it, but because I would have to face her and hold out that ugliness for her to see. When I knew what I had to do, thanks to Matthew 7 and Leviticus 6, (Who goes to Leviticus 6, I ask you? Only the Lord knows what&rsquo;s in Leviticus 6 and He&rsquo;s not afraid to use it!) I made an appointment to see her privately and on trembling knees, with the dread of humiliation in my stomach, I stood before her and confessed.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Ppppffffttt!!!&rdquo;</strong></em> She said, and flapped her hand dismissively. &ldquo;That happens all the time, and besides, it was <em><strong>my </strong></em>fault.&rdquo;&nbsp; (No. It most assuredly was <em><strong>not</strong></em> her fault!)<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nHave you ever been forgiven? Like, you absolutely knew that you were gum on the bottom of God&rsquo;s shoe and someone dismissed your&nbsp;offense with a wave of their hand? There are no words to describe that. The sudden lightness. The healing. The restoration. The humility.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, humility. The kind of humility that would level us but for grace and the inability to truly understand how disgusting we are. Sorry. We are. We all are. You may not have abused a friend and betrayed her trust, but Christ died because we overeat at the buffet too. He died because we indulge in the fantasy of &ldquo;Desperate Housewives&rdquo;. He died because we buy more shoes at the Goodwill than we can wear in a year. Wait. Is that just me?</p>\n\n<p>You recognize these things as sins, right? See, that was my problem. I excused what I was doing, measured it against a worldly standard, and felt completely justified. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad&rdquo;, I told myself. No. What I actually <em><strong>did </strong></em>was not so bad, but the motive, the scheming, the deception, the carelessness, the faithlessness, the betrayal, the total depravity of my soul&hellip;that was bad. Really bad. Like gum on the bottom of God&rsquo;s shoe bad. The thing is, we don&rsquo;t usually scratch beneath the surface to look that closely. We tend to flap our own hand and say, &ldquo;Pppppffffttt!&rdquo; to our behavior and forget that someone died so that we could be forgiven for that very thing and not have to face the penalty required for that offense and for the corruption of our soul. Our sin, no matter how small, is first and foremost against God, and yet, thanks to Jesus, we can come boldly to the throne and find forgiveness and mercy. We don&rsquo;t have to tip-toe in on trembling knees, ready to toss our cookies with fearful dread. Maybe we should. Maybe then we&rsquo;d be disinclined to flap our hands at our own sin. Maybe it would cost us enough to want to avoid that pain. And maybe in the face of His forgiveness we would leave there relieved, but with the real understanding that we are like gum on the bottom of His shoe. In humility.</p>\n\n<p>Humility is a good and wonderful thing, and so is forgiveness. If you have not experienced either, it may be time to start scratching the surface a bit. Seeing things on a deeper level, on God&rsquo;s level, will cut through your delusion like the proverbial knife through hot butter. You really aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;all that&rdquo;&hellip;and you&rsquo;ve been forgiven for thinking that you are. There is no motivation toward right living like having to stand before your accuser and agree with them. There is no joy like fully understanding who you are and what has been done for you. There is no worship like that which springs from this understanding. Look deeper. Ask the Lord to lift up his foot and show you what&rsquo;s stuck there. It will be painful, but you will rejoice.&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~The only two resolutions I made in January were to meet my reading goal for the year and to&nbsp;include at least six biographies on that list. The minute I made the second resolution, I knew I was kidding myself, but with good intentions, I borrowed some from the library. When I got home with Billy Graham&rsquo;s tome, I was just overwhelmed with the thought of 800 pages of non-fiction and I gave up the idea entirely. However, during the process of searching for something I might actually read, by happy accident I stumbled across Jerry Jenkins&rsquo; book, <em>Writing for the Soul </em>and then Anne Lamott&rsquo;s <em>Bird by Bird</em>, both of which describe the writing process from the perspective of two wildly dissimilar creative minds. I have loved every word of each book, and can&rsquo;t wait to find another like them. Both books are very much auto-biographical so I&rsquo;m giving myself a pass and considering this resolution fulfilled, at least in part.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m in the pages of Anne Lamott&rsquo;s book now where she describes the feeling a writer has as she&nbsp; holds up her newborn child and asks if it&rsquo;s ugly&hellip;otherwise known as editing. I thought I was the only one who was possessive, defensive, neurotic and insecure about every word I&rsquo;ve ever put on the page. What comfort to know that there are other crazies out there just like me!! (Be afraid!) A few weeks ago, the sweet little thing that does amazing (ah-<strong><em>maze</em></strong>-ing) work raising two little babies and promoting Verse By Verse suggested that we contributing writers submit our work to her for a quick look-see before we post to the site. I knew instantly that she was targeting me. I knew for certain that she was trying in her southern &ldquo;bless-her-heart&rdquo; style to tell me that my babies are ugly. It isn&rsquo;t pride. It&rsquo;s certainly not that I think I am above being edited. Quite the opposite. I am convinced that I am a certifiable lunatic who never mastered the English language or the rules of grammar even though I have a degree (and the Associated Press Style Manual exam score) to prove otherwise. It&rsquo;s the abject humiliation I fear! Though I believe I was (mostly) gracious in my eventual response to the request, that (hopefully) gracious fa&ccedil;ade was entirely manufactured to cover my terror, and I began immediately to frantically edit every piece she&rsquo;s ever seen posted to the site. Every line. Every word. Every jot. Every tittle. Like a lunatic.</p>\n\n<p>For Christmas this year my husband got me a new hard drive with the latest Word software. I couldn&rsquo;t begin to tell you what version it is &ndash;that is not my thing. If there is a blank page to put black letters on, I&rsquo;m all good. As I sat down to use the new program for the first time I noticed lots of little red and green lines appearing in my text. It annoyed me no end. I asked my husband what all that stuff was and he said that it was the editing software telling me that I had some grammatical problem.</p>\n\n<p>Um&hellip;excuse me?!</p>\n\n<p>Yep. Apparently, I write in passive voice. I use a lot of slang and unprofessional contractions. I have absolutely no concept of where to put a comma, and my understanding of the semi-colon went missing somewhere between Sophomore Journalism and middle age. All is lost. My fears are confirmed. Humiliation has set in and I want to erase everything that has ever been published before this moment and find a job on a worm farm. (Right now my &lsquo;editor&rsquo; is screaming at me, <em>&ldquo;passive voice passive voice passive voice</em>!!!&rdquo;). The thing is, though, I&rsquo;m oddly grateful for the new insight. I didn&rsquo;t know these glaring issues have had you distracted with correcting my grammar in your head as you read&hellip;if you have kept reading. (I don&rsquo;t usually. One misapplied your / you&rsquo;re and it&rsquo;s all over for me.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Right now you are wondering what in the Sam Hill I&rsquo;m rambling about and if you have somehow stumbled across the wrong website - oh <em><strong>so</strong></em> wrong. But I do have a point to make. I wonder if anyone has ever told you that your baby is ugly. I don&rsquo;t have many friends who will. In fact, it is a point of contention between my best friend and me. She is a pleaser. She would not tell me I had spinach in my teeth if I were on my way to the portrait studio. She never tells me when my baby is ugly. And I&rsquo;m not talking about putting silly words on a page. I&rsquo;m talking about real life now. I&rsquo;m talking about when the whining begins, when the faith falters, when the sin sits up and demands its due. Do you have an editor for those times? I don&rsquo;t. And I wish I did.</p>\n\n<p>I won&rsquo;t begin to pretend that I like it when I get&hellip;feedback. Who does? It means we&rsquo;ve been caught red-handed and we have to account for something inexplicable and stupid, some complete lack of judgment or flat out self-justified rebellion. And we have to make corrections. Sigh. I&rsquo;m sure that my defensive response to being exposed is one reason the people closest to me are loathe to point out my&hellip;issues. But I&rsquo;m telling you, I need it. I&rsquo;m like an unruly child who never quite made the transition to full adult maturity. You might not know it on the outside but on the inside&hellip;oh, who am I kidding? Everyone who knows me knows that I am a rebel without a cause (sorry for the clich&eacute;, but when the shoe fits&hellip;). This is why I need an editor: a person more determined to perfect me than I am. Someone who will dig in and insist that I use an active voice in spite of me screaming back at them that <em>I don&rsquo;t care I don&rsquo;t care I don&rsquo;t care</em>!!! I do, actually. Even though it hurts. Even though I pound the keyboard as I make the necessary changes. The Holy Spirit functions as editor, but His ways are gentle, His voice a whisper. I need a tempest and a whirlwind. I need a taskmaster: someone who will stand over me and make me work it out until every last correction is made. I need The Body.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem &ndash; and perhaps my broader point &ndash; I am disconnected from those who could most effectively hold me accountable, and if you are holding yourself in isolation from your local church body, no matter how many problems it has, you have removed all hope for effective editing in your life as well. They need you to edit them. You need them to edit you. Sometimes it will be brutal. Sometimes it will be kind. Sometimes you will insist on creative license and they will see that, in the end, it works. Sometimes it won&rsquo;t work and you&rsquo;ll have to admit it and make changes. This is the process of refinement, and The Body is the tool God has provided &ndash; the red pen, so to speak &ndash; for highlighting the areas needing correction. Fear, intimidation, pride, insecurity, neurosis, none of these is an effective excuse from removing yourself from the process. You are not the best you can be without editing. Some days your baby is ugly, your writing is trash, and you most certainly need to get your mind wired right. Some days you need someone to tell you that, and you need to accept it and make the necessary changes. Sometimes you&rsquo;re better when you&rsquo;re not quite so much&hellip;you.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s to the editing process. May we all learn to stand in the face of it and not continue to cower under our beds.</p>\n\n<p>For Kathryn. Thanks for making me better simply because you exist!</p>"

Just let me know,\" I said with another brief hug.</p>\n\n<p>I began to turn away but was immediately engulfed in a 30-minute, non-stop, emotionally-charged account of a heated conversation between three of her close friends that resulted in all three of them being mad at her and each other. It all stemmed from a single question one of the girls had asked about someone completely unrelated to their group.</p>\n\n<p>\"<em>Do you think that dress is modest enough for a girl who says she is a Christian?</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let me explain. No, there is too much. Let me sum up.</p>\n\n<p>- One of her friends was upset because she felt that the question was judgmental and \"Jesus said we shouldn&rsquo;t judge lest we be judged.\"</p>\n\n<p>- Another was upset because she felt the question was legalistic and her mother had told her \"we have freedom in Christ to dress however we want.\"</p>\n\n<p>- The third was the young woman who asked the question and noted that the Bible said women were to dress modestly.</p>\n\n<p>- My daughter&rsquo;s contribution was the observation that Paul&rsquo;s statements regarding modest attire had a specific historical context that was far different from our own modern understanding of \"modesty\". (I know. She is very much her father&rsquo;s daughter.)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After listening, comforting her, and encouraging her to pray about her friends, I shared a few thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus&rsquo; warning of \"Do not judge so that you will not be judged.\" (Matthew 7:1) is about <strong>hypocritical, self-righteous judgment</strong>. I pointed out how, just a few sentences later, He says, \"You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and<em> then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother&#39;s eye.</em>\" (Matthew 7:5) Christ also said we should \"judge with righteous judgment\". (John 7:24) As long as her friend wasn&rsquo;t being hypocritically self-righteous then she wasn&rsquo;t \"judging\" others in that sense Messiah was prohibiting.</p>\n\n<p>The Biblical concept of legalism is \"requiring someone to obey the law <strong>in order to obtain or keep salvation</strong>\" (see Acts 15:1, Galatians 3:2, etc). Unless her friend was saying that a person had to be modest in order to obtain or keep their salvation then she wasn&rsquo;t being \"legalistic\". That word is often just used as a scare tactic (like the terms \"homophobic\" or \"racist\") with the intention to stifle open and honest discussion.</p>\n\n<p>In Galatians 5:1 Paul says, \"It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.\" This is explained in Romans chapter 6:</p>\n\n<h6>Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness? But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed, and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. (Romans 6:16-18)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin: 0.85em 10px 0.85em 0px; width: 150px; text-align: left; color: rgb(153, 0, 0); line-height: 1.5em; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 1.1em; border-left-color: rgb(128, 128, 128); border-left-width: 2px; border-left-style: solid; float: right;\"><em>Any concept of grace or freedom that makes us feel more comfortable sinning is neither Biblical grace nor Biblical freedom.</em></p>\n\n<p>We <strong>do </strong>have freedom in Christ: freedom <strong>from </strong>sin not freedom <strong>to </strong>sin. Any concept of grace or freedom that makes us feel more comfortable sinning is neither Biblical grace nor Biblical freedom.</p>\n\n<p>After sharing these ideas and offering a paraphrase of Paul&rsquo;s exhortation, \"so far as it depends on you, be at peace with everyone,\" I set out to do a little digging on the topic of modesty for myself, and I was quite surprised by what I found.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>only </strong>verse in the entire NASB translation of the Bible where the word \"modest\", \"modesty\", or \"modestly\" is found is in 1 Timothy 2:</p>\n\n<h6>Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and dissension. Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments, but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness. (1 Timothy 2:8-10)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s it?</p>\n\n<p><em>One verse?</em></p>\n\n<p>All the brouhaha about Biblical modesty and the Bible has only one verse on the topic?</p>\n\n<p>Surely not!?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it was just a matter of finding the right translation.</p>\n\n<p>Searching through the ESV, NIV, NKJV, and others only added a 1 Corinthians 12 passage to my list of verses using \"modesty\":</p>\n\n<h6>The eye cannot say to the hand, \"I have no need of you,\" nor again the head to the feet, \"I have no need of you.\" On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. (1 Corinthians 12:21-25)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here Paul uses the metaphor of a person&rsquo;s physical body to describe the body of Christ. But this is dealing with our \"unpresentable parts\" and it&rsquo;s not like anybody at my daughter&rsquo;s school is running around with their unpresentable parts exposed. [Oh, dear Lord, I certainly hope not!]</p>\n\n<p>Some commentaries I read pointed to 1 Peter chapter 3 regarding modesty:</p>\n\n<h6>In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior. Your adornment must not be external--braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses; but the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God. For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands; just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear. You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered. To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit; not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing. (1 Peter 3:1-9)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hmmm. Maybe I was being too specific in my search. Maybe a definition of modesty will help me find some synonyms I can use.</p>\n\n<p>mod&bull;es&bull;ty<br />\n- showing a moderate or humble estimate of one&#39;s merits, importance, etc<br />\n- freedom from vanity, egotism, boastfulness, or great pretensions<br />\n- behavior, manner, or appearance intended to avoid impropriety or indecency</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Aha&hellip; now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere!</p>\n\n<p>There were plenty of passages that spoke about these ideas.</p>\n\n<h6>For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of themselves than they ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith. (Romans 12:3)<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. (Ephesians 4:1-3)<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God&rsquo;s holy people. Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. (Ephesians 5:3-4)<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.

Later,&nbsp;his parents decided to write a book about his visions, which has recently become a major movie&nbsp;production.</p>\n\n<p>Are Colton&#39;s claims are certainly subjective, but the important question for Christians&nbsp;to ask is are his claims&nbsp;credible&nbsp;according to scripture?&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As Christians, we are told not to believe every \"spirit\" or spiritual claim we hear.&nbsp;Rather, we are called to test these testimonies by comparing them to what the Bible teaches, as John says:&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;<em>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world</em>.&rdquo; (1 John 4:1).&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>And Paul in Ephesians 4:14 writes:</p>\n\n<h6>&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>14 As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nInstead of fallling victim to false claims and false teachers, Christians are called to imitate the skepticism and studiousness of the&nbsp;believers in Berea,&nbsp;described in Acts 17:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;<em>Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so</em>.&rdquo; (Acts 17:11)<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>So&nbsp;let&#39;s compare some of Colton&#39;s reported&nbsp;experiences to what the Bible says about God and what&nbsp;men who have entered into the presence of&nbsp;Heaven have experienced. If Colton&#39;s experience is true, it must line up with the word of God.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s begin by looking at&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Colton&#39;s most compelling claim of having sat on the resurrected Lord&#39;s&nbsp;\"lap.\" In scripture, when a person sees the glorified Jesus, the person&#39;s&nbsp;response is very different from&nbsp;Colton&#39;s: <em>the person&nbsp;is overcome with fear</em>.&nbsp;Writing in Revelation 1, John says this of his vision of seeing the glorifed Jesus:</span></p>\n\n<h6>&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>17 When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last, 18 and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Even before the Lord&#39;s death and resurrection, Isaiah experienced similar dread when he was given a vision of Heaven, leading him to react this way:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Is. 6:5 &nbsp;Then I said,<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Woe is me, for I am ruined!<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because I am a man of unclean lips,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I live among a people of unclean lips;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Obviously, Colton&#39;s experience was very unlike the one reported by the Apostle John and prophet Isaiah.&nbsp;Colton claims he sat on Jesus&rsquo; lap having&nbsp;no fear of Jesus, and he described Jesus as He appeared <em>prior</em> to His death and resurrection (yet now Jesus exists in His glorifed form). Colton&#39;s encounter&nbsp;did not&nbsp;provoke the fear of the Lord, which other godly men <em>have</em> experienced in the presence of the Lord, and his description of Jesus&#39; appearance contradicts scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Scripture teaches that the true response for a natural man&nbsp;(i.e., a sinful person) thrust into the presence of the Lord will always be abject fear and self-loathing &ndash;&nbsp;not&nbsp;sunshine, rainbows, and ponies. Men experience fear because our sin places us in jeopardy of God&#39;s judgment. Even children are sinful, so if Colton was truly in the presence of the Lord, he should have felt the fear of the Lord as other men have experienced in the past.</p>\n\n<p>We should ask why Colton&#39;s experience differed so much from the word of God?&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Do&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">we accept&nbsp;Colton&rsquo;s version of what it&#39;s like to be in the&nbsp;presence of the&nbsp;glorified Lord, or do we accept the testimony of the&nbsp;apostle John (the one whom Jesus loved) and of Isaiah, the greatest Old Testament prophet?&nbsp;The answer is easy, isn&#39;t it? We trust in the word of God and reject the false testimony.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Next, Colton claims&nbsp;Jesus&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">appeared as&nbsp;a regular human being&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">wearing a white robe (which is a symbol of having been saved by faith) with a purple sash (a symbol of human royalty), but in the Bible&nbsp;Jesus never appears in a&nbsp;\"white\" robe,&nbsp;for a white robe&nbsp;signifies appropriated&nbsp;righteousness (see Rev. 3:18). Jesus is without sin, so He is rightreous inherently. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Likewise, Jesus is never&nbsp;depicted in scripture wearing a \"purple\" sash, because purple is the&nbsp;symbol of human authority,&nbsp;not God&#39;s inherent authority. Instead, Jesus always wears a golden sash instead. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Colton&#39;s error-filled account of a \"human\" Jesus is just the kind of&nbsp;description I would expect from someone who is familiar with the Gospels but is ignorant of eschatology. The Bible teaches that the Lord&#39;s resurrected appearance is very different from the one He carried before His death.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Apostle&nbsp;John described Jesus&#39; resurrected appearance this way in Revelation 1:</span></p>\n\n<h6>&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>12 Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands; 13 and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a golden sash. 14 His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire. 15 His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters. 16 In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nOnce again, the Bible&#39;s testimony is vastly different than&nbsp;Colton&rsquo;s &ldquo;experience,\" leading us to reject Colton&#39;s testimony in favor of the Bible.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Colton&#39;s visions could not have come from God, or else God is contradicting His own word.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Next, Colton claims to have \"seen\" the Father and Holy Spirit, something no other human being has ever claimed to have experienced apart from Christ Himself!</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Colton claims to seen the Father in all His fullness and glory &ndash; yet Colton still lives despite the warning of&nbsp;Exodus 33:20:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;&ldquo;20 But He said, &ldquo;You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live!&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;In&nbsp;John 1:18 and 1 John 4:12 we read that&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">no one</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;has seen God the Father at any time except the Son.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Not even a believer entering Heaven (assuming Colton was a believer) can see the Father, for He is all Spirit, John says. The Holy Spirit is all Spirit also, yet Colton claims to have \"seen\" both in Heaven. Once more,&nbsp;Colton&rsquo;s story does not match up with scripture; it contradicts scripture.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Also, the Bible says&nbsp;nothing unclean can ever enter the Father&#39;s presence in Heaven&nbsp;(Revelation 21:27). W</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">e don&rsquo;t know Colton&#39;s heart of faith. Was Colton a believer in Jesus Christ when he experienced these visions? Was he born again when he entered the Lord&#39;s presence? (Perhaps he claims to have been a Christian, but let&rsquo;s face it, it&#39;s difficult to know for certain if a 4-year-old child is truly born again.) This question is fundamentally important, however, because it speaks to the credibility of his claims to be in the Lord&#39;s presence.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Finally, Colton claims that he saw Mary kneeling before God in Heaven. To see Mary kneeling implies Mary was in physical form (i.e., in a body), but the Bible teaches that believers who have died (like Mary) have&nbsp;yet to receive their new, resurrected bodies (1Cor 15; Dan 12:1-2). The saints do not receive their bodies until the resurrection (i.e., the rapture) at the earliest.&nbsp;Therefore, Mary <em>cannot</em> exist in Heaven in bodily form. At this point, only her spirit is in Heaven, and therefore Mary&nbsp;does not possess a \"knee\" with which to kneel. What Colton said he saw&nbsp;simply doesn&#39;t exist yet.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">At this point we should ask does the Bible tell of anyone having gone into&nbsp;heaven and come back to earth reporting such things? According to the Bible, some men have done this very thing, including&nbsp;the apostle Paul, who&nbsp;describes his experience in 2Corinthians 12. How does his experience in Heaven compare to Colton&#39;s account? Paul says,&nbsp;speaking of himself:&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;<em>2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago&mdash;whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows&mdash;such a man was caught up to the third heaven. 3 And I know how such a man&mdash;whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows&mdash; 4 was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak</em>.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>How does Paul&#39;s experience compare? <em>We don&#39;t know</em>, because Paul says he was&nbsp;not permitted by the Lord to even repeat what he&nbsp;heard, much less to describe&nbsp;what he saw. If&nbsp;Paul (the apostle who wrote nearly half of the New Testament)&nbsp;was not free to repeat what he saw in Heaven, then why is&nbsp;a 4-yr old boy&nbsp;permitted to reveal such great things?&nbsp;The prospect that the Lord prevented the Apostle Paul from revealing his experience in Heaven so He could deliver to us&nbsp;it through a 4-yr old boy&nbsp;defies common sense, if not scripture.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">What about his claims to see his grandfather&nbsp;and unborn sister, whom he never met here on earth?&nbsp;Assuming Colton&#39;s claims to seeing these individuals are true,&nbsp;such appearances are&nbsp;hardly proof of having visited Heaven. They could just as easily be explained as hallucinations or a product of&nbsp;demonic deception, since the&nbsp;demon world is capable of displaying signs and wonders, including visions of past people and events.&nbsp;Remember, scripture says Satan comes as an angel of light when he deceives people:</span></p>\n\n<h6>&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds</em>.&rdquo; (2 Corinthians 11)<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but for me there is plenty of reason to doubt Colton&rsquo;s story&nbsp;and conclude it is false.&nbsp;If it&rsquo;s false, then either Colton or his father (who was heavily involved in helping&nbsp;Colton write the book)&nbsp;concocted or coached&nbsp;Colton&#39;s testimony, or else Colton&#39;s visions were the product of&nbsp;hallucination&nbsp;or demonic influence.</p>\n\n<p>I must confess, I have not read the book nor seen the movie, but&nbsp;their claims are well-documented by other reviewers, so I felt there was no need to read the book or see the movie to test its basic claims against scriptre (indeed, it was time not wasted).&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Moreover,&nbsp;his experiences mirrors other near death experiences (NDEs), which&nbsp;make&nbsp;claims similar to Colton&rsquo;s. In fact,&nbsp;I wrote&nbsp;an </span><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/devotionals/life_after_life_examining_near_death_experiences\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">article</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;not long ago on the topic of NDEs, and Colton&rsquo;s &ldquo;experience&rdquo; fits the classic pattern. The consistency found across NDE&nbsp;stories&nbsp;argues for a common source...<em>a demonic source</em>.</span></p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, a movie reviewer stated:</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;Burpo and the film&#39;s producers want to make it clear that this movie is \"not theology; it&#39;s a boy&#39;s story.\"&rdquo;&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nSo true.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just a story...an experience...one that simply doesn&rsquo;t line up with God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp;If it were true to the Bible, then it would be theology, because&nbsp;it would clearly agree with the truth found in God&rsquo;s word. Instead, it&#39;s just a tall story.</p>\n\n<p>Though I wouldn&#39;t&nbsp;recommend seeing the movie or reading the book, they are not without some value.&nbsp;The book and&nbsp;movie open&nbsp;up a way to evangelize to unbelieving friends, neighbors, and even strangers.&nbsp;We can use their interest in this account as a springboard to explain the truth about heaven&nbsp;&ndash; and&nbsp;hell.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Cultural events like this story&nbsp;give&nbsp;us the opportunity to explain the difference between the world&#39;s views and the Bible&#39;s teaching: that&nbsp;we are sinners destined for a real hell, yet&nbsp;there is truly good news that heaven is accessible, but only through one absolute way:&nbsp;faith in the person and work of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s an objective experience worth sharing.</p>"

It never fails. In almost every first deep spiritual conversation I have with a new friend, this is the question they ask me. I know their intention is kind, but it is so presumptuous!&nbsp; You know what I want to ask in return? I want to look at them with the face of a prophet (that is my spiritual gift) and ask, &ldquo;Do you know how much God hates your sin?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to Pastor Armstrong preach through Genesis. I just finished lesson 2C in which we learn that if sin had not entered the world we would not have known the full character of God. How else would we know His holiness but in comparison with our sin? How else would we know His wrath unless there was a penalty for that sin? How else would we know His mercy but that He provided a way for us to escape that penalty? How else would we&nbsp;feel His grace but to comprehend our guilt?</p>\n\n<p>Yes. I know how much God loves me. Because I know myself.</p>\n\n<p>A pastor wrote recently that our self-worth is not dependent on man&rsquo;s point of view, even our own, but is determined by the price God set for our redemption. In other words, whatever God was willing to pay, is what we are worth. It&rsquo;s one of those sentiments that sounds good on its surface, but I&rsquo;m not sure I agree (not sure scripture does either!). I think by weights and measures it was not a fair trade. To this pastor and my friends I would ask&hellip; Do you understand what it cost to redeem you? Do you understand that by your own merit, and by the standard of the word, you are not worth it? Not even now. Not even on this side of the cross. God traded His son, His only son, whom He loved, His perfect, spotless, guiltless son&hellip;for<em><strong> you</strong></em>. He didn&rsquo;t do it because you were <em><strong>worth</strong></em> it. He did it because it was <strong>absolutely necessary</strong>. He did it because on your own you are so wretched that there was &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>no<br />\nother<br />\nway.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The depth of your sin is so profound that only a perfect life sacrificed in your place could ever satisfy God&rsquo;s wrath - and offer you the embrace of His deferred love. Even now there is nothing inherently different about who you are. Except Jesus. And the Spirit. <em><strong>Gifts </strong></em>and nothing more, which make you worthy only because of <em><strong>their</strong></em> nature&hellip;not yours.</p>\n\n<p>That, my friends, is how much God loves you. And you can&rsquo;t explain it. You can&rsquo;t give a sound reason for it. You can&rsquo;t wrangle a list long enough to prove that you earned it, and anyone who knows you intimately would give testimony that you don&rsquo;t deserve it. Because God loves you, an innocent man was beaten, mocked, and scourged, and then he carried <em><strong>your</strong></em> cross to the top of a hill where he was crucified in your place. Had he been only a man, it would be a debt you could never repay. That he was God makes it incomprehensible. Except for love.</p>\n\n<p>Love and wrath. You can&rsquo;t understand the one while being blind to the other. You can&rsquo;t fully know how much God loves you except from under the weight of a well-deserved but stayed execution.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot rest dreamy eyed in the loving arms of God and not also realize that we didn&rsquo;t earn the right to be there. We cannot trust His tenderness without also recognizing His holiness. We should not presume on His mercy without understanding the gravity of our trespass. If I err, then, in seeming to focus more on my failures than on his loving kindness, forgiveness, mercy and grace, it is only because I deeply want to be worthy of my price and I am fully aware that I am not and never will be. So, though my outward professions of God&rsquo;s love are not flowering fluff, I am still keenly aware of it from here in my brokenness. I have taken my own measure. I have drawn the plumb line. I have been weighed against a heavy standard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Yes. I know how much God loves me. Do you?&nbsp;</p>"

Spiritual death.&nbsp; There must be payment for sin in order to restore fellowship with God.&nbsp; Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin.&nbsp; From Adam, sin has passed to all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Father put into motion a plan to redeem mankind.&nbsp; There had to be a perfect sacrifice for sin.&nbsp; If payment was not made, we would all be condemned to eternal damnation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Who in all of history was without sin, spotless?&nbsp; In all of history there was not one sinless person.&nbsp; For there is no one righteous, not even one. So, God provided a sacrifice for sin&hellip;His son, Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Why would God subject His Son to such a horrible death?&nbsp; It was for love, agape love.&nbsp; For whom would He do this?&nbsp; It was for you and me.&nbsp; Who are we? We are liars, murderers, adulterers, proud, boasters, idolaters, unthankful, mockers, greedy, unloving, disobedient, violent, insolent, arrogant, wicked, evil, and haters of God.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine what God must have felt.&nbsp; He sacrificed His only Son for the wicked ones mentioned above.&nbsp; He was loving, loving, loving, agape love for you and me.</p>\n\n<p>Now, consider what they (we) did to our Lord Jesus Christ, the perfect Son of God. He was unlawfully tried.&nbsp; The Father watched, loving, loving, agape love.&nbsp; His own people rejected Him. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Father watched, love, loving, agape love.&nbsp; Keep in mind; the Father could have stopped it at any time.&nbsp; He was blindfolded, spat upon, hit in the face, and mocked.&nbsp; He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, yet He spoke not a word.&nbsp; The Father watched, love, loving, agape love. He was brought before Gentile rulers.&nbsp; He was beaten until He was unrecognizable. A murderer was preferred above him.&nbsp; They cried, &ldquo;Crucify Him&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Father watched, brokenhearted, loving, agape love.&nbsp; They crushed a crown of thorns on His head, placed a robe on his torn and battered body, and knelt mocking Him calling Him, &ldquo;The King of The Jews&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Father watched, loving, loving, agape love.&nbsp; The Father watched as judgment was passed.&nbsp; Crucify Him!&nbsp; He watched as Christ was forced to carry His cross up Calvary Mountain.&nbsp; He watched as they stripped his garments from Him and cast lots for them.&nbsp; He watched as they drove nails or spikes into His hands and His feet.&nbsp; Jesus could have called 10,000 angels, but He did not.&nbsp; Agape love.&nbsp; The Father watched as they hung His Son on the cross.&nbsp; He heard when His Son asked Him to forgive them, &ldquo;for they know not what they do&rdquo;.&nbsp; He listened while His Son made provision for His mother. The Father poured out all the sins of the world on His Son, He darkened the skies and He sent an earthquake.&nbsp; The Father turned His back because Jesus had become sin for you and me.&nbsp; Jesus became thirsty and they gave Him sour wine to drink.&nbsp; He cried out, &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo;.&nbsp; They pierced His side with a spear.&nbsp; Blood and water ran out.&nbsp; The Father could have stopped it at any time but He did not.&nbsp; Why? &nbsp;Because He sent His Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but to save us.&nbsp; &ldquo;For God so loved (agape) the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that who so ever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&rdquo; John 3:16</p>\n\n<p>This is not, praise God, the end of the story.</p>\n\n<p>The Father watched as they took His Son from the cross, wrapped Him in clean linen and laid Him in a rich man&rsquo;s tomb. &nbsp;He watched as they rolled a stone over the entrance to the tomb.&nbsp; He had told His disciples, just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the big fish, so He would be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then He would arise. &nbsp;HE AROSE, HE AROSE, HALELUJAH, CHRIST AROSE!!!</p>\n\n<p>Our sin debt has been paid.&nbsp; Our God, the only true God, is alive. He lives within my heart. He is not a statue you bow down to nor is He a bunch of dead bones in a grave somewhere.&nbsp; He is sitting at the right hand of God The Father. &nbsp;All who will come to Him will be saved.</p>\n\n<p>Let us not forget what Easter is all about.&nbsp; It is love, Agape love, for you and me.</p>"

You do things you shouldn&#39;t while you can.\"(2)</p>\n\n<p>As Tax Day approaches yet again, millions of Americans (many of them believers) will be faced with a choice: lie for monetary gain or tell the truth and pay up.</p>\n\n<p>Some, like attorney Thomas Shearman, will blame the system:</p>\n\n<pre>\n\"Any tax is bad, which can be easily evaded by fraud or falsehood, and is therefore&#10;paid only by the honest and truthful. . . . Any tax is bad, which corrupts the morals&#10;of the people or which necessarily brings into existence a class [for example&#10;lobbyists] which finds its profit in promoting wastefulness and extravagance in &#10;public affairs.\"</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The system, however, is merely a thing: it cannot choose to do right or wrong.&nbsp; Only people can choose:</p>\n\n<h6>Then Jesus said to them, \"Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#39;s; and to God the things that are God&#39;s.\"&nbsp; (Matthew 22:21)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Integrity</h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier; font-size: larger;\">in&middot;teg&middot;ri&middot;ty </span> noun</p>\n\n<p>1: firm adherence to a code of especially moral or artistic values : incorruptibility<br />\n2: an unimpaired condition : soundness<br />\n3: the quality or state of being complete or undivided : completeness</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The word \"integrity\" speaks to a <em>wholeness</em> or <em>completeness </em>that is reflected in<em> </em>the greatest commandment:</p>\n\n<h6>You shall love the LORD your God with <strong>all</strong> your heart and with <strong>all</strong> your soul and with <strong>all</strong> your might.&nbsp; (Deuteronomy 6:5)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Moses tells us we should choose G-d&#39;s ways in everything we do... at every time and in every circumstance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The book of Job relates the great loss, affliction, sorrow, and suffering of a man tested to the extreme.&nbsp; Most of us will never face the circumstances that Job did and yet, after Satan had afflicted Job by taking all of his wealth and killing all of his children, G-d described Job this way:</p>\n\n<h6>\"Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. <strong>And he still holds fast his integrity</strong>, although you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause.\"&nbsp; (Job 2:3)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Integrity before G-d means that we are active and diligent in our thinking,&nbsp;our choices, and our behaviors.&nbsp; In the midst of Job&#39;s loss and suffering, he never relinquished his undivided love, service, and faithfulness to G-d.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Righteousness</h2>\n\n<p>We are faced with moral and ethical decisions every day.&nbsp; Some of them are big and some of them are small.&nbsp; Should I tell the truth?&nbsp; Should I look at this?&nbsp; Should I do that?&nbsp; Should I take this?&nbsp; Should I?&nbsp; Should I?&nbsp; Should I?</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the answer?&nbsp; What <strong>should</strong> we do?&nbsp; <strong>How</strong> do we choose?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In ancient times people offered animal sacrifices to G-d when they sinned and made mistakes but King Solomon writes</p>\n\n<h6>To do righteousness and justice is desired by the LORD more than sacrifice. (Proverbs 21:3)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is echoed in the words of the prophet Isaiah:</p>\n\n<h6>Thus says the LORD, \"Preserve justice and do righteousness, For My salvation is about to come And My righteousness to be revealed.\"&nbsp; (Isaiah 56:1)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The LORD desires justice and righteous living.&nbsp; It&#39;s not an easy path to follow.&nbsp; Perhaps, like Job, there will be a book written about our lives and our choices.&nbsp; Perhaps, like Job, we will also be called righteous (Ezekiel 14:20).</p>\n\n<p>We all stumble in our walk with G-d.&nbsp; It is destiny of mankind in this fallen world.&nbsp; But even in our stumbling there is good news!&nbsp;&nbsp;In Proverbs 24:16, King Solomon wrote, \"A righteous man falls seven times, and rises again...\".</p>\n\n<p>When (not <strong><em>if</em> </strong>but <strong><em>when</em></strong>) we stumble and fall, we shouldn&#39;t lie to ourselves and pretend we aren&#39;t sinning.</p>\n\n<h6>If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us.&nbsp; (1 John 1:8)</h6>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rather we should confess our sins to one another (James 5:16), acknowledge that Messiah is our righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30)&nbsp;and rise again to walk with Him.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Truth</h2>\n\n<p>\"Lie\" can be both a noun and a verb.&nbsp; \"Bobby told a lie.\" (noun)&nbsp;or \"Bobby lied about his age.\" (verb)</p>\n\n<p>\"Truth\" is only a noun.&nbsp; You have to <strong>do something</strong> with the truth: <strong>tell</strong> the truth, <strong>speak</strong> the truth, <strong>reveal</strong> the truth, <strong>share</strong> the truth, etc.&nbsp; This is [ahem] true in most languages... pardon the pun.</p>\n\n<p>G-d has given us the One who is the Way, the <strong>Truth</strong>, and the Life... but we must choose to <strong>do</strong> something with&nbsp;the Truth we have been given.&nbsp; First, we should trust in Him like Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Rahab- all the great men and women of faith listed in Hebrews chapter 11.&nbsp; Second, we should rely upon His sovereignty, greatness, and provision in all circumstances.&nbsp; Third, we should daily... hourly... surrender our lives and align our choices to serve and honor Him.</p>\n\n<p>Recall the exhortation of Joshua:</p>\n\n<h6>...choose for yourselves today whom you will serve... but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.&nbsp; (Joshua 24:15)</h6>\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p>So... what was the&nbsp;point of all this?</p>\n\n<h6>O LORD, who may abide in Your tent?

                 "body": "<p>~~I&rsquo;ll ask your indulgence in a bit of self-disclosure at the outset of my rambling today. My Grandmother died yesterday. I did not know her. I was the product of a lustful encounter outside of marriage. I was not wanted. My existence made a mess of my parents&rsquo; and grandparents&rsquo; lives, resulting in shame, regret, and public humiliation &ndash; I am a living embarrassment. That is the short answer to why I did not know my grandmother.</p>\n\n<p>My growing up years were spent being dragged down a trail of broken relationships like Sherman&rsquo;s march to the sea. Relatives were alienated. My mother&rsquo;s &ldquo;significant others&rdquo; came and went. Friends proved faithless. You get the idea. In my mid-twenties, my mother and I became estranged (she disappeared and left no forwarding address&hellip;literally&hellip;I could <em>not </em>make this up) and my sister severed ties with me several times until it finally stuck. In my early thirties, in an effort to find a replacement family, I sought out and met my biological father who had never been a part of my life up to that point and was only a vague memory from my toddler years. The result was not what I expected. It was confusing, and disappointing, and overwhelming, and painful. There was no explanation offered to provide a resolution to my abandonment, and no viable replacement for what I had lost. In the ensuing years, my dad and his family have gone to great lengths to make me a part of their family.&nbsp; But I resist. Every time they pull up in my driveway, they drag my baggage behind them. &ldquo;Unwanted&rdquo;. &ldquo;Abandoned.&rdquo; &ldquo;Rejected.&rdquo; These are the adjectives that attach themselves to me like lint on a sweater, and my grandmother&rsquo;s rejection of me unto death has dumped that bag of dirty laundry right in the middle of my floor today. My <em>grandmother</em> died yesterday, and I did not know her. She did not know me. That&rsquo;s what we chose. And today I cannot stop weeping.</p>\n\n<p>My story is not unique. Remember that I volunteer at the Northwest Arkansas Children&rsquo;s Shelter (props to them!!), and in every little face I see there, I see me. In every angry teenager there, I see me. It&rsquo;s personal. I <em><strong>know </strong></em>their pain. And if you&rsquo;re &ldquo;one of us&rdquo;, I know yours too. It&rsquo;s the pain of not belonging. It&rsquo;s the pain of constant rejection. It&rsquo;s the pain of believing that for some reason beyond your ability to comprehend you are a sin and a shame to the people from whom you most crave love and acceptance. You are unlovable. You are un-embraceable. You are an object lesson in being the last one standing when teams are chosen; no one really wants you, but some are <em>obligated</em> to take you, and in that, you become an unwelcome burden. You are guilty of transgression simply because you are alive, and eventually, you will be tossed out or passed along - and that&rsquo;s only if you&rsquo;re lucky. If you&rsquo;re unlucky, you&rsquo;ll be overlooked and forgotten and invisible.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s a whole lot of pity on one page, right there! Forgive me. I do have a point. This kind of life experience messes with your head, and when you begin to truly walk with Christ it messes with your faith. As every good thing is taken from you, what&rsquo;s left behind is an empty pit that continually belches the sulfur of hell into your life. It&rsquo;s hard to battle what you&rsquo;ve learned by experience to be true. Acceptance and rejection. Desperation and indifference. Permanence and instability. These are the coins I keep constantly in the air depending on the prevailing winds of my relationships. I am ready to flee at any moment, heart intact, denying any discernable damage. That includes fleeing my relationship with Christ, or at least remaining safely detached in case he makes&nbsp;a hasty retreat into oblivion on the heels of his mistake in having started up with me to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Now I&rsquo;m about to be harsh with us all here &ndash; all of us in this common struggle&hellip;to continue to live like this is sin. It is the evidence of unbelief. God is not man that he should lie about his promises or renege on them. He is not man that he should walk away from his child and never look back. Nor would he change his address and not tell you, or go to his death before reaching out to you. But we who lived this kind of life before Christ continue to live with the expectation of immanent abandonment and rejection. We work like slaves to earn his approval and acceptance when what we should do is rest in his grace and the truth that nothing can separate us from his love, and that he will never &ndash; no, not ever &ndash; leave us or forsake us. Faith is being sure of what we <em><strong>can&rsquo;t see</strong></em>&hellip; what we <em><strong>haven&rsquo;t known </strong></em>or experienced. Instead, we believe what we learned: that good things &ndash; lasting things &ndash; are reserved for <em><strong>other</strong></em> people. Good people. Acceptable people. Whole people. But faith is being sure of God&rsquo;s love in spite of ourselves, in spite of what we know about ourselves, what we learned about ourselves. Faith is believing that he can love us simply because he can&rsquo;t help himself and for no other reason. He sought us! He chose us! He wanted us! He died so that we could always be with him! Not because he had to. Not out of obligation. Not because we temporarily won him over. I <em><strong>know </strong></em>all of this. You <em><strong>know </strong></em>all of this. But <em><strong>believing</strong></em>&hellip;ah&hellip;that&rsquo;s another thing entirely.</p>\n\n<p>I shared this part of my story with you because I know you are out there. I know you&rsquo;re reading this, waiting for answers. I don&rsquo;t have any. But Jesus does. Jesus knows what it&rsquo;s like to be a reject, a cast-off, a shame to his family, an embarrassment and a humiliation. And He came to embrace us and bring us into his family. He made himself a mockery to the world so that we could be accepted. He forfeited love so that we could receive it. What no one has ever done for you even in part, he did completely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I know you don&rsquo;t want to &ndash; I know you can&rsquo;t really embrace this pain &ndash; but walk to the edge of your pit and just look over the edge. That hole that was left as one good thing after another was yanked from your old life&hellip;it isn&rsquo;t there anymore. Christ has filled it completely. Poured out, pressed down, shaken together and running over. One drop of blood extinguished the flames and filled the crevasse, no matter how deep or how wide. Whatever you missed, it&rsquo;s there. Love is there. Acceptance is there. Faithfulness is there. Forgiveness is there. Joy is there. Peace is there. Security is there. Rest&hellip;is there. That pit has become a well for you to draw from, and to live as if you are empty is to neglect that gift.</p>\n\n<p>I write from the edge of my pit, not from successful experience, and yet with every painful, humiliating reminder that my grandmother&nbsp;would disregard my existence to her last breath, I am drawing strength from the well. I am battling back with the truth that I am a chosen, cherished, and wholly acceptable child of God. I am experiencing the embrace of an immeasurable love from which nothing can ever separate me. I am holding fast to the peace and security I find in those truths. And I am letting it all fill me with joy while I grieve and heal. His truth is sufficient for my need today. It is abundant. It is a generous outpouring from an extravagant Father to his needy and wounded child. I will live today from that well. I will <em><strong>believe</strong></em>. It is enough.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<em>&ldquo;Though my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will receive me.&rdquo;</em> Psalm 27:10<br />\n(I&rsquo;ve always secretly believed he put that verse in there just for me, but I will gladly share it with you if you need it.)</p>"

                 "body": "<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of time. I ran into the supermarket. In and out, you know. I just needed milk.</span></p>\n\n<p>And eggs&hellip; And bread. And cheese, and ketchup, and panko crumbs, and butternut squash soup, and peanut butter cookies, and ooh my favorite chips were on sale&hellip; &nbsp;You know how it goes. &nbsp;So now I was racing down the aisle that leads to the self check-out station, because when you&rsquo;ve blown the little time you didn&rsquo;t have nothing seems more expeditious than fumbling with UPC symbols that refuse to be scanned.&nbsp;It was as I was pushing my cart a little too fast down that aisle, the greeting card and cutesie-gift aisle, that a book caught my eye. The title,&nbsp;<strong><em>God Always has a Plan B</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>You know I couldn&rsquo;t just walk away from it. I picked it up and turned to the title page to find the publisher. <em>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what happens when you get your theology from Hallmark,&rsquo;</em> I thought to myself. Although at this point I could almost relate to the title, as my Plan A of running in and out of the supermarket had totally gone out the window. I turned to the back and read <em>&ldquo;Frustrated? Confused? Disappointed? Don&rsquo;t Worry &mdash; God has a Plan B just for you!&rdquo;</em> &nbsp;The back goes on to say, <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the Bible&rsquo;s promise that &lsquo;in all things God works for the good of those who love him.&rsquo; (Romans 8:28)&rdquo;</em> (Their lowercase de-emphasis, not mine.)</p>\n\n<p>Full disclosure, I have not read this book. I was not about to blow $9.95 on the gospel according to Hallmark. I think there may be some good, comforting content in this book, which says it contains scriptures and parables, and quotes from famous Christians (but that&rsquo;s another can of worms). My problem is with framing God&rsquo;s will in terms of &ldquo;Plan B.&rdquo; I hear that so much, especially from the mouths of Christians.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And thank goodness we have Romans 8:28 handy to throw out there at people&rsquo;s faces! Or its popular paraphrase, &ldquo;When God closes a door, He opens a window.&rdquo; What kind of loving father sticks his child in a room, shuts the door and sits back to watch the child crawl out a window? Romans 8:28 is one of those over-abused Bible verses. In its proper context, Paul is speaking about our sanctification, and the comfort we should all have in knowing that even though our renewed spirit is at war with our decaying flesh, NOTHING is beyond God&rsquo;s control. &nbsp;If anything, the verse emphatically argues against any notion of a &ldquo;Plan B.&rdquo; (For a detailed exposition on this, check out our study in the <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Book of Romans</a>, Lesson 8B).</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not about God closing a door. It may be that sometimes we try to walk through the wrong door in rebellion. Our Father will use our missteps to help us find the door He intended for us. Other times He will have us walk through a door that leads to a room full of pain. But often those are the rooms where we grow closer to Him &ldquo;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for THOU art with me&rdquo; right? That is how He works everything for good, to accomplish His overall purpose, to grow us in faith, for our sanctification, so that we know that even though our flesh is of the world, His Spirit in us is ever growing stronger and the work He began in us is being perfected.</p>\n\n<p>If we profess to believe God is sovereign over ALL, then we cannot also hold the view of His ever having a &ldquo;Plan B.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s plan is always &ldquo;Plan A.&rdquo; Whether you knew that or not is a completely different issue. &nbsp;But assuming a Plan B reduces God to some kind of life coach on the sidelines. When you try something and it doesn&rsquo;t work you go to your coach so He can rework your strategy and (cross your fingers!) hope for a good outcome. Errr&hellip; no.</p>\n\n<p>The next time your &ldquo;Plan A&rdquo; fails, recognize the loving hand of God guiding you to <strong>HIS</strong> Plan A. And when a well-meaning soul trying to comfort you says, &ldquo;You know, when God closes a door He opens a window,&rdquo; kindly turn to them tell and them that it&rsquo;s more like you tried to go through the wrong door and God is saying, &ldquo;I love you, dopey, but that&rsquo;s the closet.&rdquo;</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As I wrote recently about <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/devotionals/refuting-purgatory\">purgatory</a>, I had been discussing Catholic doctrine with a neighbor. &nbsp;Like many Catholics, my neighbor has an emotional attachment to Mary, the mother of Jesus.&nbsp; My neighbor, and the Catholic church, believe that Mary was ever virgin, and that after Jesus&rsquo; birth she never had any children.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From my perspective, this issue is more or less irrelevant.&nbsp; If a person wants to believe this but believes the gospel, I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to engage in a debate about something that won&rsquo;t impact their eternal salvation.&nbsp; However, as I thought about this in light of Catholic beliefs, I thought it would be helpful to look at what Scripture says about this teaching.&nbsp; Hence, this article.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reason I think it&rsquo;s useful for believers to understand this issue is so they can engage Catholic friends and family with gentleness and respect, directing them to study what Scripture says.&nbsp; This is because many Catholics idolize Mary, and the belief that she was ever virgin feeds this idolatry.&nbsp; Most will not admit that their devotion to Mary is idolatry, but it&rsquo;s difficult to call it something else.&nbsp; So, I&rsquo;m hopeful that this article will help Christians show Catholic family and friends the truth about Mary, the mother of our Lord.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With respect to Mary&rsquo;s eternal virginity, I think there are really two related, but distinct, issues here.&nbsp; First, was Mary &ldquo;ever virgin&rdquo;; that is, she could have not been ever virgin but still be childless.&nbsp; Second, did Mary have children other than Jesus.&nbsp; As always, we look to Scripture for the answer.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, we look at what Scripture says regarding Mary&rsquo;s virginity.&nbsp; To be sure, Scripture goes to great lengths to demonstrate that Jesus would be born of a virgin.&nbsp; The reason for this has nothing to do with Mary.&nbsp; Rather, it has everything to do with Jesus, to show He is the God-Man, not a child of Adam.&nbsp; With God as His Father, Jesus can be without sin, even though Mary was a sinner.&nbsp; Recall, sin comes from the father, as we are all sinners in Adam (see Romans 5).</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Isaiah 7 says, &ldquo;<em>14 Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon discovering that his betrothed virgin wife was pregnant, Joseph sought to quietly divorce Mary, as he thought she had committed adultery.&nbsp; An angel of the Lord visited Joseph in a dream, and quoted Isaiah (from Matthew 1; see also Luke 1):</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. 19 And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly. 20 But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &ldquo;Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. &nbsp;21 She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.&rdquo; &nbsp;22 Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: &nbsp;23 &ldquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,&rdquo; which translated means, &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo; &nbsp;24 And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took Mary as his wife, 25 but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, we know that Mary was a virgin <em>before</em> she became pregnant with Jesus by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; However, note what v. 25 says above.&nbsp; Joseph &ldquo;kept her a virgin&rdquo; <strong>until</strong> she gave birth to Jesus.&nbsp; The Greek here actually says Joseph did not &ldquo;know&rdquo; Mary until she gave birth to Jesus.&nbsp; This is the same language we read in Genesis 4:1, where Adam is said to &ldquo;know&rdquo; Eve, and they had a son, Abel.&nbsp; This clearly shows that Joseph and Mary eventually had sexual relations.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is very important.&nbsp; If God kept Mary &ldquo;ever virgin&rdquo;, stating this in Matthew 1 would have been the perfect opportunity.&nbsp; Instead, we read that Mary was a virgin until Jesus was born.&nbsp; We have to ask ourselves, <em>why</em> does God say here that Mary was a virgin <strong>until</strong> Jesus was born?&nbsp; God does not put useless statements in the Bible.&nbsp; The clear implication here is that Joseph and Mary had sexual relations after Jesus was born.&nbsp; What would be the point of saying Joseph kept her a virgin <strong>until</strong> Jesus was born?&nbsp; Again, this is stated here not because of Mary, but to demonstrate that Jesus was born of God.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The article (to which my neighbor referred) also says that Mary took a vow of perpetual virginity, that Joseph was an old widower who was marrying her only to take care of her.&nbsp; There is absolutely no support for this in Scripture.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; Zero.&nbsp; Indeed, if Mary had devoted herself to God&rsquo;s service as a perpetual virgin, would she really need an older, widowed man to care for her?&nbsp; Would not God take care of her?&nbsp; The article makes no sense, both Scripturally and logically.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, we see that Mary was <strong>not</strong> ever virgin.&nbsp; But, this does not prove she had children, so we now consider what Scripture has to say about this.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since we have shown from Scripture that Mary had sexual relations with Joseph after Jesus was born, it&rsquo;s obviously possible that Mary and Joseph had children of their own.&nbsp; It is also possible that Joseph was a widower who already had children when he married Mary (as the article claims), but Scripture does not indicate this.&nbsp; In any event, let&rsquo;s consider the passages that demonstrate Mary had children (whether hers or stepchildren from Joseph).</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Matthew 12 says, &ldquo;<em>46 While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and brothers were standing outside, seeking to speak to Him. 47 Someone said to Him, &ldquo;Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You.&rdquo; 48 But Jesus answered the one who was telling Him and said, &ldquo;Who is My mother and who are My brothers?&rdquo; 49 And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, &ldquo;Behold My mother and My brothers! 50 For whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven, he is My brother and sister and mother</em>.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The word for brother is the Greek <em>adelfos</em>, which can mean the following:&nbsp; 1) a brother, whether born of the same two parents or only of the same father or mother; 2) having the same national ancestor, belonging to the same people, or countryman; 3) any fellow or man; 4) a fellow believer, united to another by the bond of affection; 5) an associate in employment or office.&nbsp; Since <em>adelfos</em> can have different meanings, the context in which it is used will help us understand the right meaning.&nbsp; To prove our point here, I&rsquo;ll show Scripture where it&rsquo;s obvious brother means blood brother, and Scripture that means something else.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Matthew 4 says, &ldquo;<em>18 Now as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 19 And He said to them, &ldquo;Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.&rdquo; 20 Immediately they left their nets and followed Him. 21 Going on from there He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them. 22 Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&rsquo;s obvious here that Peter and Andrew were brothers, and James and John were brothers.&nbsp; As an example of a passage that does not mean brother by blood is Acts 9:17, which says,&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>So Ananias departed and entered the house, and after laying his hands on him said, &ldquo;Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit</em>.&rdquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Clearly here, Ananias is referring to Saul (Paul) as a brother in Christ, a fellow believer.&nbsp; The point here is that we can discern which definition is in view by the context of the passage.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With that in mind, let&rsquo;s consider when Scripture says Jesus had a brother (my emphasis added).</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Acts 1:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey away. 13 When they had entered the city, they went up to the upper room where they were staying; that is, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. 14 These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, and <strong>Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers</strong></em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This passage clearly has blood brothers in mind here.&nbsp; If it meant believers, the passage would have said Peter, John, etc. were also Jesus&rsquo; brothers.&nbsp; Instead, brothers is included with Mary as His mother.&nbsp; These brothers could theoretically be Joseph&rsquo;s previous children, but clearly we are talking familial brothers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mark 6 (also Matthew 13):&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Jesus went out from there and came into His hometown; and His disciples followed Him. &nbsp;2 When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and the many listeners were astonished, saying, &ldquo;Where did this man get these things, and what is this wisdom given to Him, and such miracles as these performed by His hands? &nbsp;3 Is not this the carpenter, <strong>the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not His sisters</strong> here with us</em>?&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once again, the clear meaning of the passage is blood relations (mother, brothers, sisters).&nbsp; While not explicit, the implication is that these are Mary&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; If God wanted us to believe that Mary was ever virgin, would it not make sense to say &ldquo;the children of Joseph&rdquo;?&nbsp; Nowhere in Scripture do we read about Joseph having children prior to marrying Mary.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Galatians 1:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>18 Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days. 19 But I did not see any other of the apostles except <strong>James, the Lord&rsquo;s brother</strong></em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1 Corinthians 9:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>5 Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as the rest of the apostles <strong>and the brothers of the Lord</strong> and Cephas</em>?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Again, these are clearly Jesus&rsquo; family brothers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">John 7:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>1 After these things Jesus was walking in Galilee, for He was unwilling to walk in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him. 2 Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was near. 3 Therefore <strong>His brothers said to Him</strong>, &ldquo;Leave here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are doing. 4 For no one does anything in secret when he himself seeks to be known publicly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world.&rdquo; 5 <strong>For not even His brothers were believing in Him</strong>. 6 So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;My time is not yet here, but your time is always opportune. 7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify of it, that its deeds are evil. 8 Go up to the feast yourselves; I do not go up to this feast because My time has not yet fully come.&rdquo; 9 Having said these things to them, He stayed in Galilee</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since Jesus&rsquo; disciples are mentioned and contrasted with His brothers, we can safely conclude that these are His familial brothers.&nbsp; Also, families journeyed to the feasts together, which gives more evidence for this being Jesus&rsquo; brothers.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given all of these passages, it is logical and reasonable to conclude that Jesus had at least four brothers and two (or more) sisters (Mark 6 above).&nbsp; Were they Joseph&rsquo;s from a previous marriage, or the children Joseph and Mary had after Jesus was born?&nbsp; I conclude they are the children of Joseph and Mary.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are at least two reasons why I believe this.&nbsp; First, Scripture makes clear, as we saw above, that Joseph &ldquo;knew&rdquo; Mary after Jesus was born.&nbsp; It is only logical that they had children.&nbsp; Therefore, such children would be the ones Scripture mentions above.&nbsp; Furthermore, marriage is a picture of Christ, and the family is God ordained.&nbsp; It would only be fitting that Jesus&rsquo; earthly parents would exhibit such a picture, and Scripture is clear they were married and had children.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Second, if Joseph had previous children, how come Scripture never mentions them when speaking of Jesus, Joseph and Mary when they traveled (while Jesus was a small child)?&nbsp; For example, in Luke 2 we read about Joseph and a pregnant Mary traveling to Bethlehem for the census:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>1 Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth. 2 This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3 And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city. 4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, 5 in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child. 6 While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth. 7 And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The only ones mentioned are Joseph and Mary, who was pregnant.&nbsp; Where are Joseph&rsquo;s other children?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Likewise, in Matthew 2, Joseph is warned in a dream to flee to Egypt because Herod is trying to kill Jesus:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>13 Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, &ldquo;Get up! Take the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him</em>.&rdquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Where are Joseph&rsquo;s other children?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, Matthew 2 speaks about Joseph&rsquo;s return from Egypt:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>19 But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said, 20 &ldquo;Get up, take the Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child&rsquo;s life are dead.&rdquo; 21 So Joseph got up, took the Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, why are Joseph&rsquo;s other children never mentioned?&nbsp; Clearly, because they did not exist.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In summary, given all the evidence from Scripture, it is clear that Jesus had brothers and sisters, and that these were the offspring of Mary and Joseph.&nbsp; Therefore, it&#39;s also clear that Mary was not \"ever virgin\".&nbsp; It is far better to believe Scripture than it is to believe the falsehoods of men.&nbsp; This false teaching of the Catholic church helps lead some into idolatry, and the Bible says idolaters will not inherit the kingdom of God.&nbsp; I pray this will be helpful in evangelizing Catholics.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~I might have studied art history or something similarly unemployable if I had been born into a wealthy family. I have a bourgeois love affair with art and I confess to being a clich&eacute;d devotee of the Impressionists - Monet and Seurat among my favorites. Some of my son&rsquo;s earliest &ldquo;field-trips&rdquo; were to the art museum in St. Louis. (There is no better way to pass a rainy day with a toddler!) In my enthusiasm, I often breach the gallery line over which you are not to step or reach. I mind the rules about my hands and feet, but I will bend as far forward as possible without falling over to get my nose right up to the canvas to see exactly what color that smudge or that dot is. It fascinates me how those minute details make up the whole. When taken in isolation, they seem meaningless, but add them to the one above it, below it, beside it, and you have created something significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In my last post, I told you about sitting with my friend at the hospital while she waited for the final word about her husband&rsquo;s chances of recovery, and silently charted her course in the event that there was none. We said goodbye to Mike on Saturday in a service that was a funny and poignant testimony to a life well lived. Stories were told. Tears were shed. Laughs were shared. And I sat there thinking that at the end of a man&rsquo;s life, what&rsquo;s left is the minutia: the memories of moments. The dots and smears of Mike&rsquo;s life painted a picture of a man who loved well. And was well-loved.</p>\n\n<p>The dots matter. I began this post thinking the opposite &ndash; prepared to write the opposite &ndash; but as I wrestled with the passing of Mike&rsquo;s life from this earth, I realized that, to his family and friends, the dots matter the most. It will be the same when others give the testimony of our lives, and though at that point the canvas will be complete, the stories told will be about the dots that made up the whole. Those small daily encounters, the simple words with which we bless or spear each other, the touch or lack of it, laughing, crying, driving to and fro, buying groceries and getting a meal on the table, playing jokes, doing homework, mowing the lawn, singing and dancing&hellip;living in the minutia matters. Life is where our moments butt up against someone else&rsquo;s moments and create something more than each moment would be alone. It&rsquo;s where we become more than we would be alone, and where our lives become something more than they would be alone. Putting our dots next to another&rsquo;s matters, but in our myopic focus we miss the opportunity to seize a moment and fill it with substance.</p>\n\n<p>See, not only are the dots important, but having a vision of the big picture is too, and painting toward that purpose. Otherwise, we end up with Jackson Pollack&rsquo;s random tangle &ldquo;No.5&rdquo;, and not Seurat&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sunday Morning&rdquo;, in which every smudge intentionally contributes to a purposeful whole. Life is about choosing our landscape and setting up our easel and making every brush stroke deliberate toward an end. The goal is not for our creation to be a series of unconnected, random, isolated and pointless stokes of color, but for each stroke to be a complement to the greater meaning and to contribute to an intentional outcome.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I wax abstractly philosophical. Let me clarify. Last night my teenaged son and his friends drove themselves to a movie and then played like little children at the McDonald&rsquo;s Play Place. They posted Instagrams, and they laughed and goofed and acted like&hellip;teenagers-acting-like-children. And on the way home, one of my son&rsquo;s friends drove his SUV into a tree. (He&rsquo;s OK.) But every moment leading up to that was an effort to squeeze the life&rsquo;s blood out of an hour of time. Teenagers are not mindful of producing a discernable picture from&nbsp;their moments, but they surely leave every drop of paint on the canvas, smeared into a cacophony of color as their dots blend with the dots of their friends. Had those been his last dots, they would have painted a picture of a life well and truly <em><strong>spent.</strong></em> (Thanks be to our merciful God that they were NOT his last dots!!)</p>\n\n<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that we should all live in the wanton disregard for reality that is a teenager&rsquo;s mind, but what if we decided &ndash; <em><strong>decided</strong></em> &ndash; to live the ordinary moments of our life like they really matter. What if we <em><strong>expended</strong></em> ourselves completely to what now seems like randomness. What if we became resolute to actually &ldquo;do all to the glory of God&rdquo;? Still too theoretical?&nbsp; The glory of God is nothing more surreal than the beauty and vibrancy of God&rsquo;s character made manifest and tangible on this earth &ndash; in our lives and in the effect that our lives have on the lives of others. (See Galatians 5:22-23) If it looks like God&hellip;it is His Glory! If it sounds like God&hellip;Glory! If it feels like God&hellip;Glory! Dot. Dot. Dot. Across the canvas, an image begins to emerge as we take the Glory of God by the hand and drag it into each moment, seizing that moment for eternity, redeeming it to God&rsquo;s purpose, and putting the dot of that moment next to another one filled with equal purpose until the whole Glory of God materializes on the canvas of our lives. It doesn&rsquo;t happen by accident; it happens because we have a clear vision of what we want to recreate, and we set about copying that image onto our own canvas one dot, one smear, one stroke, one moment at a time. Finally then, at the end of the days in which we focused on our subject, what will hang in the gallery is a completed image of a holy and loving God that was created by the dots of our moments recounted and relieved by those we chose to smudge up next to. This is our goal. This is our purpose. This is our epitaph. Dot. Dot. Dot.</p>"

However, salvation is just the beginning of our Christian walk with the Lord.&nbsp; At the moment we are born again, we are babies in Christ.&nbsp; We are happy, so in love with our Savior.&nbsp; But, Satan is ready to attack.&nbsp; He loves to attack newborn Christians.&nbsp; Newborns are still drinking the milk of the Word, not yet grounded in God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp; They are most susceptible because they are at their weakest point in their Christian walk.&nbsp; Satan wants to draw them away from Christ and back into the world of sin.&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s not just the newborns, it is all of us.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not just once or twice, but for all of our life here on earth.&nbsp; He is the roaring lion roaming around seeking whom he can devour.&nbsp; That is Satan&rsquo;s plan.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">God has an entirely different plan.&nbsp; He wants to grow us in our faith, mature us in His Word, and give us the mind of Christ.&nbsp; He wants our obedience and our service, and to be in fellowship with Christ&rsquo;s sufferings.&nbsp; He wants us to be complete, ready to stand at the day of His appearing.</span></p>\n\n<p>To get where He wants us and to be what He wants us to be (complete) we must endure the spiritual trials and temptations that will surely come upon us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>1 Peter 4:12&nbsp; &ldquo;Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you.&nbsp; Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Then in James 1:2 we are told to count it as all joy when we encounter various trials.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">What do these trials and temptations, and did I mention persecutions, look like?&nbsp; What forms do they take?&nbsp; They are many and varied.&nbsp; There are lusts of the flesh, desires for worldly things that take us away from God.&nbsp; We may have to deal with the loss of a loved one.&nbsp; We may have to watch a loved one suffer and not be able to help them.&nbsp; There may be marital problems that seem insurmountable.&nbsp; We may be facing financial problems.&nbsp; We may suffer in pain.&nbsp; We may be persecuted for sharing Christ.&nbsp; You might have your heart broken because a loved one refuses to believe in Christ.&nbsp; The list goes on and on.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The question is, how do we handle these tests of our faith?&nbsp; Do we give in to the temptation to sin?&nbsp; Do we throw up our hands in defeat and give up the battle to Satan?&nbsp; Do we turn our backs on the Lord and go back into the world?&nbsp; Or, do we do as the Lord says?</span></p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">Luke 10:27 &ldquo;You shall love The Lord Your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your MIND.&rdquo;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I stress MIND because this is the trial I wanted to tell you about in my own life and how my Lord and Savior brought me through it.&nbsp; Having been saved for many years, I have endured probably all of the tests I listed above, and I&rsquo;d like to say I passed all of them with flying colors but that would not be true.&nbsp; The more grounded you are in the Word the less likely you are to be drawn away by Satan.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Remembering that Satan can do nothing to me that God doesn&rsquo;t allow, I believe the Lord threw me into this spiritual trial head first.&nbsp; I was unsuspecting, blindsided, by a thought that struck at the very foundation of my faith.&nbsp; Jesus is not who He says He is!&nbsp; What???&nbsp; I could not believe that such a thought had just gone through my mind.&nbsp; Where on earth did that come from, certainly not from me?&nbsp; The shame I felt.&nbsp; I was absolutely stunned.&nbsp; I immediately asked God&rsquo;s forgiveness.&nbsp; If that had been the end of it, if only, but no, it continued on for months and months.&nbsp; I was so ashamed, I did not tell anyone about it.&nbsp; For a time I was afraid to even pick up my Bible.&nbsp; You can be sure, that is exactly what Satan wanted.&nbsp; The really strange thing to me was that I did not believe one thing he was putting in my mind, it was the shame I felt for the thought going through my mind in the first place.&nbsp; Every time he would put a thought in my mind, I would counter with scripture.&nbsp; I was fleeing for my very life, yet he continued.&nbsp; Next he tried to get me to stop praying.&nbsp; I did not stop praying, but all I could pray for, was forgiveness.&nbsp; As I said, I stopped reading the Word, but not for long.&nbsp; This has always been one of my favorite scriptures.&nbsp; I would read it over and over to comfort my troubled mind.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h5>Colossians 2:6-10 &ndash; &ldquo;As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus The Lord, so walk ye in Him.&nbsp; Rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.&nbsp; Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ.&nbsp; For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&nbsp; And ye are complete in Him, which is the head of all principality and power.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">There are many, many scriptures attesting to the deity of Christ.&nbsp; John 1:1 and Genesis 1:1, for example.&nbsp; I knew all these and believed all these.&nbsp; Satan didn&rsquo;t stop there.&nbsp; He loves to point out sins you&rsquo;ve committed since you have been saved.&nbsp; He likes to tell you that God will not forgive you.&nbsp; This is another lie of the devil.&nbsp; Christ paid for all sin on the cross, once, for all.&nbsp; If I come to Him in repentance, He will forgive.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">If you can imagine arguing with Satan, then picture it in your mind. &nbsp;I wrestled with him.&nbsp; For we wrestle not with flesh and blood but principalities and powers of darkness. We are no match for him.&nbsp; He is a liar and the author of lies.&nbsp; After all, he has had thousands of years to perfect his craft.&nbsp; We must put on the whole armor of Christ so that we will be able to stand in the face of such testing. &nbsp;Christ Himself was tested and tried just as we are, yet without sin.&nbsp; Can you imagine what it must have been like for Jesus?&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Why does Satan bother with a Christian?&nbsp; He wants us to fall, to turn our backs on the Lord, and return to the world.&nbsp; He wants us to deny Christ, which I don&rsquo;t believe a true believer can do.&nbsp; When we are saved, we are given eternal life.&nbsp; How long is eternal?&nbsp; Infinite, there is no going back to unsaved.&nbsp; Jesus said that all the Father had given Him, He would lose none.&nbsp; No one can take us from the Father&rsquo;s hand.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I do not have the words to tell you how broken I was.&nbsp; I was broken-hearted, shredded like paper, without strength.&nbsp; I was trying to fight Satan by myself.&nbsp; I rebuked him, he persisted.&nbsp; What could I do?&nbsp; I could stay in the Word, pray, not just for forgiveness, but for help from the Lord.&nbsp; Here the Holy Spirit really helped me with intercessory prayer.&nbsp; I was so torn-up I could hardly put two words together.&nbsp; My heart was broken for thoughts I could not control.&nbsp; I refused to be drawn away by my adversary.&nbsp; I asked Jesus to please take control of my mind and rebuke Satan, just as Michael had told Satan, &ldquo;may the Lord rebuke you&rdquo;. &nbsp;I told the Lord I didn&rsquo;t know what was happening, but I loved Him with all my heart, soul, strength, and &nbsp;MIND.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t fight him on my own, I can&rsquo;t control my thoughts.&nbsp; Here is where I found my answer.&nbsp; I was not in control, God was.&nbsp; I asked Him to rebuke Satan, and He did. The Lord brought me through this trial.&nbsp; The Lord will win the war, but he wants us to be in the battle.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Put on the whole armor of Christ.&nbsp; Never let Satan shake your faith.&nbsp; Be constant in the Word, be fervent in prayer, be obedient, and in service to the Lord.&nbsp; Count it all joy when you fall into different trials and temptations.&nbsp; All of these things work together for good to those who love God, who are called according to His purpose.&nbsp; (Ephesians 6:10-17 and James 1:2-12)&nbsp; Love Him with your entire mind.</span></p>\n\n<h5>Romans 8:38-39, &ldquo;For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate up from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo;</h5>"

In the course of events to come, the Apostasy must first come to the church. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This is followed by the Antichrist and the Tribulation. The writer of Revelation 3:14-22 addresses the Laodicea church:</span></p>\n\n<h5><em>&ldquo;I know of your deeds; you are neither hot nor cold,&hellip; but lukewarm ... I (God) will spit you (the church) out of My mouth.&rdquo; (Revelation 3:14-22)</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The word &ldquo;apostasy&rdquo; comes from the Greek word apostasia, which means to forsake or desert the faith that one previously held. This passage applies to the church today. As smug as today&rsquo;s churches may feel with their successful programs of growth, God says: &ldquo;I will spit you out of My mouth.&rdquo; &nbsp;I cannot think of anything more abhorrent than being spit on, let alone being spit out of the mouth of a Holy God. The church in America, like its counterpart in Europe, has forsaken and deserted the fundamentals of their faith &ndash; indeed, we have become a post&#8209;Christian people. In all my years as a believer, I have witnessed significant changes in the evangelical church &ndash; changes that have undermined our beliefs and our need for dependence upon God&rsquo;s word. Satan, as the deceiver of mankind, continually plants seeds of doubt in the minds of individuals. Using false teachers and poorly equipped bad teachers, Satan distorts, twists and outright lies to corrupt our understanding of the Word of God. Few churches today teach verse-by-verse to give a faithful interpretation of God&rsquo;s Word. Most mainline and the new mega churches have abandoned the sound doctrinal teaching, replacing it with subjective and experiential content (feelings-oriented beliefs). This drift has been a major contributor to the demise of biblical discernment. Churches, pastors, and believer&rsquo;s all bear partial responsibility. The following are major movements within the church that have led to the displacement of Biblical discernment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Displacement of Biblical Discernment</strong></p>\n\n<p>During the late 1970s to early 1980s, the Church Growth Movement took shape. This movement was and remains an attempt to increase church membership through self-oriented programs designed to meet the &ldquo;felt needs&rdquo; of its membership. In opposition to God&rsquo;s way, the church has embraced &ldquo;the way that seems right unto man&rdquo;. Rather than a place of worship, the church has become a business. Its &ldquo;church-marketing&rdquo; efforts have been a major factor in ushering man&rsquo;s so-called wisdom into the church and distancing it from the Scriptures.</p>\n\n<p>Aiding and abetting these self-oriented felt-needs programs, enter Christian Psychology or Counseling. Many formerly conservative Bible teaching churches and seminaries have allowed humanistic doctrines of self-love and self-esteem to infect their churches. After all, how can one possibly love God or one another, unless we first learn to love ourselves. This is psychoheresy! The self-oriented integration of worldly psychology alongside the Bible has destroyed the Biblical doctrine of the sufficiency of the Scriptures. Man is now dependent upon self, rather than humbly seeking to be God-dependent.</p>\n\n<p>For the last several decades, many conservative Charismatic and Pentecostal believers have also drifted away from the objective, written Word of God. They have embraced &ldquo;subjective experience&rdquo; over the &ldquo;objective truth&rdquo; of the Word. Many churches have fallen under false teaching that says: God speaks to believers today with the same or greater authority than is found in the Bible. Self-appointed modern apostles thus declare their teachings to be above the Word of God. The result is that churches embrace a false gospel of health and wealth, name and claim it, man-centered spiritual warfare, and some even literally roar like lions.</p>\n\n<p>Apostasy is further revealed in the non-believer oriented Seeker Sensitive Movement, which has at its core the belief that the church should avoid at all costs to offend the one who is &ldquo;seeking&rdquo; (i.e., a non-believer). Preaching of sound doctrine is to be dumbed-down, to a level that the unbelieving world can understand. However, an unbeliever does not seek, but is drawn by the Spirit to faith. The work of the believer is to evangelize. The work of the church, using gifted believers, becomes one of rooting, building-up, and establishing its sheep in the faith (Col&nbsp;2:7). Entertaining is not a work. The church is to convict its sheep of sin, not to overlook their sins and desensitize its sheep to the world&rsquo;s system of sin.</p>\n\n<p>Moving down another level of apostasy, the youth-oriented Emerging Church Movement is an attempt to reach the youth culture for Christ by emulating an ungodly and worldly culture. According to emerging church leaders, &ldquo;the church must be re&#8209;imagined&rdquo; in order to accommodate man&rsquo;s debased thinking. They regard the Bible itself as the chief obstacle to reinventing Christianity. But that&rsquo;s no problem, through Satanic deception, they simply distort the Word of God. Is it any wonder that God says: &ldquo;He will spit them out of His mouth!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>When today&rsquo;s Laodicean churches dumb-down the Word of God and substitute entertainment in order to increase their church growth, one must ask these two questions: Is that church being led by false teachers? And, how many of its members are truly saved? A truly Spirit led church must 1) preach the true gospel of salvation through Christ, 2) must root, build-up, and equip its believers to walk in godliness (Col 2:7), and 3) equip them to lead and disciple others (2 Tim 2:2).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Believer&rsquo;s Responsibility</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tragically, my heart despairs when I see too many immature and untrained Christians trapped inside apostate churches. Whether one faces bad or even false teaching, a believer, under the direction of the Holy Spirit, must assume responsibility to develop personal godliness and Biblical discernment.</p>\n\n<p>Many end times apostate churches defend their lack of teaching by arguing that believers will be bored or unable to comprehend Biblical teaching. If an apostate pastor never instructs a believer from the Word, then this statement is probably true. As a new baby believer, I attended a church that solidly taught the Word of God verse-by-verse. For the first few months, 99% of what I heard did indeed go over my head. But, by the time the pastor finished the book, I had obtained a sound understanding of that Bible book. However, in order for a new or young believer to obtain a sound understanding, a believer needs to find a local church that will faithfully teach the Word. If one is unable to find a church, seek out websites like Grace Bible Chapel, www.gbcsa.org, Verse-by-verse Ministry www.vbvmsa.org, or the Christian Jew Foundation, www.cjfm.org. Also search for the websites of men like John MacAurthur, RC Sproul, or James Boice.</p>\n\n<p>In 2 Tim 2:15, the Apostle Paul commands believers &ldquo;to be diligent to present yourself as a workman &hellip; accurately handling the word of truth.&rdquo; In other words &ndash; &ldquo;study to show thyself approved.&rdquo; If you do not study the Word of God, then you can&rsquo;t know God&rsquo;s will. If you don&rsquo;t know God&rsquo;s will, your walk will not glorify God and you will bear little fruit. From my earliest days with the para-church organization the Navigators, it was drilled into my head that one needs to discipline oneself to read and study the Word of God daily, to meditate upon His Word, and to pray. The emphasis was on developing a habit. The studying of the Bible and learning what it teaches, becomes the basis for walking in godliness. This leads to spiritual maturity.</p>\n\n<p>In the end time apostasy, the believer will face worldly deception and immorality. In 2 Tim 3:1, Paul says: &ldquo;realize this that in the last days difficult times will come.&rdquo; Verses 2-5 continue by describing the character of those who hold a form of godliness, but deny its power.</p>\n\n<p>In the end time apostasy, when apostate pastors refuse to instruct their sheep about sin, just letting sin slide, the result is that the believer&rsquo;s heart becomes insensitive to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s conviction of sin. Substituting the world&rsquo;s standards for God&rsquo;s principles of living, the believer slowly drifts away from God. Apostate churches are full of both believers and unbelievers who are self-centered, lovers of money, party-goers, unmarried yet living with their partner, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. They hypocritically fake a form of godliness, while denying its power. Paul says: &ldquo;Avoid such people (2 Tim 3:1-5).&rdquo; In verse 6 &amp; 7, Paul continues to say that weak believers (weighed down by their sin and acting upon their carnal impulses) will allow those who embrace the world&rsquo;s standards to enter their households and take them captive. They will be at the mercy of demonic wolves ready devour their testimony and destroy their walk &ndash; unless they make the effort to seek out a church that faithfully instructs them how to walk and put to death the flesh.</p>\n\n<p>In the end time apostasy, both strong and weak believers will face trials and temptations. However, their trials will be no greater than any other generation. Trials come in the form of inward moral tests that give rise to the temptation to sin. Others come as outward difficulties such as persecution, leading some to fall away. Yet God promises: &ldquo;that no temptation will overcome you &hellip; but He is faithful and will provide the way of escape (1 Cor. 10:13).&rdquo; Trials are also a test of one&rsquo;s love of God. &ldquo;If you love Me, you will keep my commandments (John 14:15).&rdquo; As a believer, you need to study to understand what the Word of God says so that you can discern right from wrong. James 1:2 says: &ldquo;consider it all joy when you encounter trials, knowing that the testing of your faith (your trials) produces endurance.&rdquo; When difficulties come into one&rsquo;s life, they will test your faith. If your faith (your walk) is genuine, then you will persevere. Perseverance is the ability to stand against Satan when he brings the storms to your life. In this way you will demonstrate your love for God.</p>\n\n<p>McMahon, writing for The Berean Call (Feb 2013), says:</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Spiritual beliefs of today&rsquo;s believers tend to be a collection of things they&rsquo;ve heard (bad sermons, false radio &amp; TV preachers, their moneymaker books, secular movies, etc.) mixed with what they may or may not have gotten from the Bible. They have been spoon-fed rather than getting their spiritual meals directly from God&rsquo;s Word.&rdquo; Yet today, they tragically miss the truth of the Word. They reason and accept: &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be of value to get input from various self-proclaimed Christian sources (like the History channel, their own seeker-sensitive pastors, false TV teachers, etc.) regarding the teachings of our Lord? Hasn&rsquo;t our Lord already gifted teachers to help believers better understand His Word? Yes God has. But if false teaching is our primary feeding of God&rsquo;s Word, it leads to a spiritual anemia at best and makes us defenseless against spiritual deception at worst. How can a believer tell the difference between a good teacher and a false teacher? Although Scripture tells us that God gave some to be teachers (Ephesians 4:11), His Word also tells us, &ldquo;There shall be false teachers among you, who shall bring in damnable heresies&rdquo; (2 Peter 2:1). So how can we know what&rsquo;s what and who&rsquo;s who?&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Most Christians are not asking such questions - nor do they seem to be concerned about the consequences related to a lack of biblical discernment. The second chapter of Hebrews begins with a warning that we could &ldquo;drift away&rdquo; from the Scriptures and find ourselves drifting along with some thought or teaching that seems biblical, but is not. More and more frequently these days, I hear confessing and professing Christians excusing themselves for their unbiblical beliefs and practices by declaring that they all nevertheless &ldquo;love Jesus.&rdquo; What Jesus might that be? Is it the biblical Jesus - the One who declares that He is &ldquo;the way, the truth, and the life&rdquo;? Is it the Word incarnate, who challenges everyone who professes to be a believer in Him by asking: &ldquo;And why do you call me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?&rdquo; (Luke 6:46). Would our reply be, &ldquo;Sorry, Lord, I didn&rsquo;t study Your Word, I wasn&rsquo;t aware of most of the things that you said&rdquo;? If that&rsquo;s the case, having &ldquo;the mind of Christ&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:16) is a wishful delusion.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>In summary, Scripture warns all believers that in the end times a great apostasy will overtake the church. Pastors and individuals will desert the faith that they previously held. Today, apostasy has infected many hearts and has penetrated the soul of the church. Churches and their members have already turned away from God and His instructions, eagerly embracing Satan&rsquo;s world system. Paul understood the devastating destruction that would come from this apostasy. To the leaders of these churches, Paul gives this warning:</p>\n\n<h5><em>&ldquo;Be on guard for yourselves, and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which He purchased with his own blood. I know that after my departing savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them&rdquo; (Acts 20 28-30).</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In 2 Timothy 4:2, Paul instructs Timothy how to conduct himself as a pastor.</p>\n\n<h5><em>&ldquo;Preach the Word! Be ready in season and out of season. Reprove, rebuke, and exhort with great patience and instruction.&rdquo;</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>First and foremost, Timothy is commanded to &ldquo;preach the Word!&rdquo; Preaching the Word is not always easy. The message we are required to proclaim is often difficult and offensive. Christ Himself was a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense. The message of the cross is a stumbling block to some and foolishness to others. The natural man does not understand the things of God. They are foolishness to him. Furthermore, Timothy is to preach the Word in faith, (the conviction that God&rsquo;s word is true and living) and with love, (a kindness and compassion towards the believer). Based on the Scriptures, one thing is certain &ndash; a pastor is not commanded to entertain his flock. Nor is he to amuse them with humorous stories, to impress them with his great oratory skills, or to dazzle them with worldly illustrations. He must not water down the Word, turning it into a motivational message, but boldly and unashamedly preach. He is not to be a man pleaser, but a God pleaser.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Timothy is to &ldquo;be ready in season or out of season&rdquo; to preach. In other words, a pastor must be ready to preach the Gospel and the Word, whether it is popular or irrelevant. Today&rsquo;s market-driven church tells us that the day of expository preaching and theology is over. Preaching is not what the culture-driven believer wants to hear. They want a church experience that will satisfy them on their own terms. Paul also instructs Timothy to be ready, meaning that a pastor must study to be prepared and that he must be eager to preach. Today, many apostate pastors despise the Word. They are often reluctant and refuse to preach the Word of God.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, Paul instructs Timothy that as he preaches, he must &ldquo;reprove, rebuke and exhort.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;reprove&rdquo; conveys the meaning of correcting a believer&rsquo;s behavior or a false understanding of doctrine through the use of Biblical instruction. The word &ldquo;rebuke&rdquo; implies confrontation. A pastor needs to confront his congregation concerning their inward sinful motives. The goal is to bring about repentance. Following reproof and rebuke, exhortation involves comfort and encouragement that exhorts one to live godly. However, Apostate preaching emphasizes positive preaching. This kind of preaching is intended to meet one&rsquo;s &ldquo;felt needs&rdquo; &ndash; to feel good, not to confront and convict one of their &ldquo;real need&rdquo; &ndash; repentance of their sin. Scripture also tells us that all teachers will be held to a higher standard of judgment. While it is yet today, apostate pastors need to evaluate what they are teaching and how they are teaching. They need to change course and begin again to teach sound doctrine to their flock.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Paul also speaks to end time believers. To them this apostasy will have following devastating effect:</p>\n\n<h5><em>&ldquo;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:3)</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Not enduring sound doctrine opens one up to spiritual deception. Paul writes to Timothy with a certainty that a time will come when &ldquo;they will not endure sound doctrine.&rdquo; Paul says that nominal believers willfully choose to &ldquo;not endure.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;endure,&rdquo; anexontai in Greek, implies that they will not 1) put up with sound doctrine, 2) listen to the truth, 3) tolerate the Word, or 4) take it to heart in order to live according to God&rsquo;s instructions. Instead, these professing believers will follow their own lusts, seeking to satisfy their sinful desires. &ldquo;Wanting to have their ears tickled&rdquo; means that they want Christianity on their terms. To that end, they will only listen to pastors who preach what they want to hear &ndash; that which satisfies their carnal self-willed heart. They come to be entertained. They participate in church approved work projects so they can feel good about themselves. Their good works become a false security for their salvation. And when they walk out the church doors, they resume their normal pattern of sinful behavior. Most remain unchanged by the message and too many remain unjustified.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;Study to show thyself approved to God.&rdquo;</span></p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~I&rsquo;m still reeling from my recent conversation with God about how I don&rsquo;t let him rescue me. It&rsquo;s like suddenly discovering that you&rsquo;ve had your skirt tucked into your panty hose all day and everyone noticed but you. The funny thing about faith is that you can preach it all day long, but you can&rsquo;t prove it until you need it. And it&rsquo;s the needing it that none of us wants. It&rsquo;s in the needing it that I <em>perceive</em> God&rsquo;s betrayal. And maybe I&rsquo;m right, in some small way, to believe that God will not rescue me from all sadness and from all pain and from all conflict, because God is not really interested in saving us &ldquo;from&rdquo;. That would leave us with an unproven faith. It would be like having a pretty chair in our house that no one ever sits in because it is far too delicate to be trusted, or comfortable. There it sits with its pristine upholstery, starched and upright and priggish, but not at all useful. We walk around it admiring it and we praise it to our friends and talk about how much it has added to our already aesthetically pleasing life, and they in turn praise our remarkably good taste in having chosen it, but we don&rsquo;t sit in it, and we don&rsquo;t want to.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nI just left a hospital waiting room where a friend now sits making the decision about whether to sustain her husband&rsquo;s life or let him go. He fell in the garage. Now, after 34 years of weaving the threads of their lives together into one tapestry, she faces the rest of her life without him. A blank canvass. Just like that. As I walked to my car, I realized that I was relieved to be on this side of the decision she&rsquo;s facing and the pain and loss that&rsquo;s ahead of her. I was selfishly thankful that I could get up and leave all that behind me after offering my sincere but pitiful encouragement. Every day I pray some version of &ldquo;save me&rdquo;. &ldquo;Save me from the pain. Save me from the loss. Let me enjoy this faith-thing in theory, just not in practice.&rdquo; But in the pain and the loss&hellip;that&rsquo;s where God is, and we can&rsquo;t find him &ndash; not really &ndash; any other way.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nJust before all this happened I was having breakfast with a friend who said that we have the God of &ldquo;through&rdquo;. God told Moses to go &ldquo;through&rdquo; the Red Sea, he led the Israelites &ldquo;through&rdquo; the dessert, and he took Joshua &ldquo;through&rdquo; the Jordan River. When Joshua reached the other side of the Jordan God told him to set up stones of remembrance. This is what my friend needed today&hellip;my friend at the hospital deciding between useless life and all-consuming death. She needed remembrance. She needed to remember that three years ago this same man had a stroke and had to learn to walk and talk again and that she got <em>through</em> that. She needed to remember that when he couldn&rsquo;t return to work and she became their support, she got <em>though</em> that. She needed to remember all the things she never wanted know or experience to begin with (and there is much!) so that she could remember how she got <em>through</em>. She has rock solid faith that has not wavered that in the face of this decision. Doesn&rsquo;t mean it will be easy, but she knows she&rsquo;ll get through because she&rsquo;s already had to. She&rsquo;s had to because God did not save her <em>from</em> all that came before. Since he did not save her <em>from</em> it, she now knows that she can get <em>through</em> it. Her faith in Him is proven.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n\"<em>Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that thetesting of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, sothat you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing</em>.\" (James 1:2-4 NASB) Let endurance have its perfect result: proven faith.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe hardest thing to remember while we endure this life is that hardship and suffering are not proof of God&rsquo;s betrayal but tools through which we prove that HE IS. You can fill in the blank there &ndash; He is strong, He is merciful, He is present in our pain. He invites us to experience him fully as we endure what must be endured. We endure believing that He is with us through it, working to part the waters, leading us where we need to go, patiently enduring our fits and false starts, and walking us slowly, slowly into deeper faith. Unshakable faith. Unwavering faith. Tested, proven, suffered and endured faith. Faith not like a useless chair, but like a sagging sofa with a particularly soft spot molded through time and experience to your exact form. Faith that has come <em>through</em>, not faith that has escaped <em>from</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nConsider it all joy.</p>\n\n<p>In memory of Mike Stockton. Go in peace to your eternal rest. We&#39;ll join you when we&#39;re <em>through </em>here.</p>"

(2) There is no one holy like the Lord, Indeed, there is no one besides you, nor is there any rock like our God. &nbsp;(3) Boast no more so very proudly, do not let arrogance come out of your mouth; for the Lord is a God of knowledge, And with Him actions are weighed. &nbsp;(4) The bows of the mighty are shattered, But the feeble gird on strength. &nbsp;(5) Those who were full hire themselves out for bread, But those who were hungry cease to hunger: &nbsp;Even the barren gives birth to seven, but she who has many children languishes. &nbsp;(6) The Lord kills and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and raises up. &nbsp;(7) The Lord makes poor and rich; He brings low, He also exalts. &nbsp;(8) He raises the poor from the dust, He lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with nobles, and inherit a seat of honor; For the pillars of the earth are the Lord&rsquo;s, and He set the world on them. &nbsp;(9) He keeps the feet of His godly ones, but the wicked ones are silenced in darkness; For not by might shall a man prevail. &nbsp;(10) Those who contend with The Lord will be shattered; Against them He will thunder in the heavens, the Lord will judge the ends of the earth; And He will give strength to His king, and will exalt the horn of His anointed.&rdquo;</em><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>I was stuck here. I read and reread this hymn or prayer over and over again. &nbsp;I wrote it down. &nbsp;What is God telling me? &nbsp;I had to do some soul searching. &nbsp;Do I give the Lord the praise and worship He deserves from me? &nbsp;When He answers my prayers do I just say, &ldquo;thank you Lord&rdquo;, and go on my merry way? &nbsp;After much soul searching and prayer, I have to say, &ldquo;shame on me&rdquo;. &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>During this time of reflection I remembered a church service I had the privilege of participating in. &nbsp;To this day it is still the best sermon I have ever heard. &nbsp;A missionary, (I love missions) spoke for 45 to 55 minutes. &nbsp;The whole sermon was scripture. &nbsp;Christ in the Bible. &nbsp;There was no expository, just scripture. &nbsp;He quoted from Genesis to Revelation and back again. &nbsp;Everyone was on their feet with hands raised in worship. &nbsp;I was not standing because I had been in a car accident and was confined to bed for months. &nbsp;I saw this sermon on TV. &nbsp;I could however raise my hands in worship. &nbsp;God&rsquo;s word is powerful! &nbsp;Doesn&rsquo;t He inhabit the praises of His people? &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So do I just worship Him in a church service? &nbsp;No I don&rsquo;t, but do I worship Him as I ought to? &nbsp;I believe this is what the Holy Spirit was teaching me. &nbsp;I should worship and praise Him continually. &nbsp;Always have a heart of worship. &nbsp;Praise Him for who He is. &nbsp;The Almighty God, the Creator, the All Powerful, the Protector, the Keeper, the Judge, the Maker of Kings, the Promise of the King of Kings, and so much more.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice. &nbsp;I give Him praise, honor and glory, for He is worthy to be praised.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>I have recently been discussing Catholic doctrine with a neighbor.&nbsp;Contrary to official Catholic teaching, my neighbor appears to believe that salvation is by grace alone by faith alone in Christ alone.&nbsp;I say <em>appears</em> because my neighbor still believes in purgatory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As part of our discussion, my neighbor sent me an <a href=\"http://www.catholic.com/blog/tim-staples/is-purgatory-in-the-bible\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> authored by Tim Staples of Catholic Answers.&nbsp;His article,&nbsp;I was told, gives scriptural references to support the teaching of purgatory.&nbsp;After reading the article, I decided to respond with a refutation of purgatory.&nbsp;Since so many Christians have Catholic family and/or friends, I thought this refutation of the false doctrine of purgatory might be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>First, as he does in his article, we need to see what the Catholic church officially, and &ldquo;infallibly&rdquo;, teaches about purgatory.&nbsp;(I say infallibly because the Catholic church teaches that <em>anything</em> the pope and magisterium teach regarding faith and morals is infallible.&nbsp;Since this teaching comes from their catechism, it is infallible according to the Catholic church and must be believed by the Catholic faithful.)&nbsp; From the Catholic catechism:</p>\n\n<h6>III. The Final Purification, or Purgatory</h6>\n\n<h6>1030 All who die in God&#39;s grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven.</h6>\n\n<h6>1031 The Church gives the name Purgatory to this final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The Church formulated her doctrine of faith on Purgatory especially at the Councils of Florence and Trent. The tradition of the Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture, speaks of a cleansing fire:</h6>\n\n<h6>As for certain lesser faults, we must believe that, before the Final Judgment, there is a purifying fire. He who is truth says that whoever utters blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will be pardoned neither in this age nor in the age to come. From this sentence we understand that certain offenses can be forgiven in this age, but certain others in the age to come.</h6>\n\n<h6>1032 This teaching is also based on the practice of prayer for the dead, already mentioned in Sacred Scripture: \"Therefore Judas Maccabeus] made atonement for the dead, that they might be delivered from their sin.\" From the beginning the Church has honored the memory of the dead and offered prayers in suffrage for them, above all the Eucharistic sacrifice, so that, thus purified, they may attain the beatific vision of God. The Church also commends almsgiving, indulgences, and works of penance undertaken on behalf of the dead:</h6>\n\n<h6>Let us help and commemorate them. If Job&#39;s sons were purified by their father&#39;s sacrifice, why would we doubt that our offerings for the dead bring them some consolation? Let us not hesitate to help those who have died and to offer our prayers for them.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Now, to make sure I don&rsquo;t misinterpret what is meant above, here is how the author interprets this:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;This seems so simple. It&rsquo;s common sense. Scripture is very clear when it says, \"But nothing unclean shall enter [heaven]\" (Rev. 21:27). Hab. 1:13 says, \"You [God]... are of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on wrong...\" How many of us will be perfectly sanctified at the time of our deaths? I dare say most of us will be in need of further purification in order to enter the gates of heaven after we die, if, please God, we die in a state of grace.&rdquo;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So, to summarize, according to the Catholic church, all who are not without sin at death must go to purgatory in order to become clean, that is, without sin, in order to enter heaven.&nbsp;That is the purpose of the &ldquo;purifying fire&rdquo;, from which they get the name purgatory.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Before addressing each argument he makes to support purgatory, let&rsquo;s look at what Scripture says about the above official, &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; Catholic teaching.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">First and foremost, purgatory denies the sufficiency of Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice.&nbsp; (Interestingly, the author mentions this in the article but then never gives any support as to why purgatory does not deny this sufficiency.)&nbsp; Purgatory teaches that when we die we still have sin that has not been forgiven, thus it must be &ldquo;purged&rdquo;.&nbsp; However, Scripture teaches just the opposite.&nbsp; In each passage, it is my emphasis added.</span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Hebrews 7:&nbsp; &ldquo;23 The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing, 24 but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 25 <u>Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them</u>.&nbsp; 26 For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27 <u>who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself</u>. 28 For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Hebrews 9:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>11 But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation; 12 and not through the blood of goats and calves, but </em><u>through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption</u>.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Hebrews 10:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>11 Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; 12 </em><u>but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God</u><em>, 13 waiting from that time onward until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet. 14 </em><u>For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified</u><em><strong>.</strong> 15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying, 16 &ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, says the Lord:&nbsp; I will put My laws upon their heart, And on their mind I will write them,&rdquo; He then says, 17 &ldquo;</em><u>And their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; 18 Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin</u>.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1 Peter 3:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>18 </em><u>For Christ also died for sins once for all</u><em>, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit</em>.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Romans 6:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>10 For the death that He died, </em><u>He died to sin once for all</u><em>; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. 11 Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus</em>.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>John 13:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>9 Simon Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, then wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.&rdquo; 10 Jesus said to him, &ldquo;He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; </em><u>and you are clean</u><em>, but not all of you.&rdquo; 11 For He knew the one who was betraying Him; for this reason He said, &ldquo;Not all of you are clean</em>.&rdquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jesus&rsquo; sacrifice on the cross was a one time event, and through His sacrifice, He paid for the sins of His children <em>once</em> for all.&nbsp; If he paid this only once, and if it provided redemption for believers, then by definition, He paid for <em>all</em> of our sins, past, present and future.&nbsp; By His blood, Jesus has obtained for us eternal redemption.&nbsp; By faith in Him, we immediately have this eternal life, and we are clean, just as God&rsquo;s holy word says.&nbsp; Indeed, God has said He will <em>remember our sins no more</em>; if He no longer remembers our sins, how is it we must be &ldquo;purified&rdquo; from them?&nbsp; The author also quotes Habakkuk, which says nothing unclean can enter heaven.&nbsp; Yet, Jesus tells us that if we are His, we are already clean (John 13:10).&nbsp; In addition, the author says almost no one will be perfectly sanctified at the time of our death.&nbsp; Hebrews 10:13, however, says, &ldquo;<em>For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified,\"</em>&nbsp;meaning all believers are perfectly sanctified.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Purgatory says the sins we die with must be paid for by the &ldquo;purifying fire&rdquo; of purgatory.&nbsp; Scripture, however, says that Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross paid for our past, present and future sins.&nbsp; Likewise, Christ&rsquo;s righteousness is imputed to the believer, so God sees us as He sees His Son, perfectly righteous.&nbsp; This is why we are perfected, and it is why God will remember our sins no more, since they have been punished on the cross.&nbsp; As the Scriptures above demonstrate, God&rsquo;s word proves purgatory to be a false teaching.&nbsp; Even worse, it blasphemes the gospel of Christ by teaching that His sacrifice and imputed righteousness was not sufficient.&nbsp; Purgatory is part and parcel of the false gospel of Catholicism<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s now consider the arguments the author makes for purgatory.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Argument 1 for Purgatory</h4>\n\n<p>He first turns to II Maccabees 12:39-46, which says:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;39 On the following day, since the task had now become urgent, Judas and his companions went to gather up the bodies of the fallen and bury them with their kindred in their ancestral tombs. 40 But under the tunic of each of the dead they found amulets sacred to the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. So it was clear to all that this was why these men had fallen. &nbsp;41They all therefore praised the ways of the Lord, the just judge who brings to light the things that are hidden. 42 Turning to supplication, they prayed that the sinful deed might be fully blotted out. The noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what had happened because of the sin of those who had fallen. &nbsp;43 He then took up a collection among all his soldiers, amounting to two thousand silver drachmas, which he sent to Jerusalem to provide for an expiatory sacrifice. &nbsp;In doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble way, inasmuch as he had the resurrection in mind; 44 for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead. &nbsp;45 But if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. &nbsp;46 Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be absolved from their sin.&rdquo;</span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>IIMaccabees was never part of the Hebrew Scriptures, and is considered an &ldquo;apocryphal&rdquo; book, meaning it was never part of Holy Scripture.&nbsp; The original OT canon was Jewish, and contained the twenty two books (the same thirty nine in today&rsquo;s Protestant Bible; some were combined as one).&nbsp; This canon was known as the Palestinian canon.&nbsp; When the Hebrew OT was translated into Greek (the Septuagint) in Alexandria, Egypt, included in the canon were fifteen books known as the Apocrypha.&nbsp; These were likely included due to the tradition of many churches viewing these books as &ldquo;useful&rdquo;, but not canonical (indeed, not all of these books were accepted by the Council of Trent, an &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; Catholic council).&nbsp; There are many good reasons why Christians reject the apocryphal books as being included in the OT canon.&nbsp; These include history and evidence from some of the books themselves.&nbsp; Specifically:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>No apocryphal books were written by a prophet</strong>.&nbsp; All of the OT Scriptures were written by prophets, while none of the apocryphal books were; therefore, the apocryphal books are not canonical.&nbsp; Scripture attests to this view in that the OT is referred to as the Scriptures of the prophets.</li>\n\t<li><strong>The apocryphal books were not accepted by the Jews as part of the OT</strong>.&nbsp; If these books were part of the canonical OT, then surely Jesus would have criticized the Jews for excluding them from Scripture, yet He never does.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Jesus and the apostles never quote from the apocryphal books</strong>.&nbsp; The OT testifies of Christ, and He gives testimony to the validity of the OT by quoting from many of its books.&nbsp; The apostles, likewise, quote from the OT.&nbsp; Yet they never quote from any of the apocryphal books.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Many Jewish scholars and early church fathers rejected the apocryphal books as canonical</strong>.&nbsp; Jewish writers such as Philo and Josephus, and the rabbis at the Council of Jamnia all rejected the apocryphal books as canonical.&nbsp; Most of the early church also rejected them, including Origen, Athanasius, Hilary, Cyril, Epiphanius, Ruffinus,&nbsp; and Jerome.&nbsp; Interestingly, cardinal Cajetan, the man the Catholic church sent to debate Luther, also rejected these books as canonical.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Some apocryphal books contain many historical and geographical inaccuracies</strong>.&nbsp; The Bible does not contain such inaccuracies.&nbsp; These errors prove the books that contain them are non-canonical.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Some apocryphal books contradict Scripture</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>The apocryphal books were never accepted as canonical by the church until the Council of Trent</strong>.&nbsp; Roughly 1,500 years after these books were written, the Catholic church decided to &ldquo;officially&rdquo; recognize the apocrypha as Scripture.&nbsp; These books were not accepted as canonical Scripture by either the Jews or the early Christian church.</li>\n\t<li><strong>No apocryphal book makes the claim that it is the word of God</strong>.&nbsp; While most OT books do claim to be God&rsquo;s word, none of the apocrypha claim this status.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there are several problems in the Maccabees text itself.&nbsp; First, the passage acknowledges that the men were killed by God for idolatry (v. 40).&nbsp; Thus, they died in their idolatry, and Scripture says this of idolaters:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God</em>.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 6)&nbsp; In addition, Scripture makes clear that there is no &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; once a person dies.&nbsp; Hebrews 9:27 says, &ldquo;<em>And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The passage goes on to say that the Jews took up a collection for an &ldquo;expiatory sacrifice&rdquo; for the idolaters.&nbsp; Yet, Scripture says, &ldquo;<em>No man can by any means redeem his brother Or give to God a ransom for him&mdash;8 For the redemption of his soul is costly</em>.&rdquo; (Psalm 49)&nbsp; Furthermore, Hebrews 10:4 says, &ldquo;<em>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This contradicts v. 46 in the Maccabees passage.&nbsp; Finally, the passage contradicts itself.&nbsp; Verse 45 says there is a reward for those who have gone to rest in &ldquo;godliness&rdquo;.&nbsp; Yet, v. 40 says they died as idolaters, meaning they died in ungodliness.</p>\n\n<p>As if acknowledging that II Maccabees is not God&rsquo;s word, the author says this:&nbsp; &ldquo;Rejecting the inspiration and canonicity of II Maccabees does not negate its historical value. &nbsp;Maccabees aids us in knowing, purely from an historical perspective at the very least, <em>the Jews believed in praying and making atonement for the dead shortly before the advent of Christ</em>. This is the faith in which Jesus and the apostles were raised.&rdquo; (emphasis in original)&nbsp; So, here the author is making two absurd assumptions.&nbsp; First, he assumes that what the Jews believed and practiced at the time of Christ was correct.&nbsp; Second, he implies that Jesus and the apostles agreed with such practices since this is the faith in which they were raised.</p>\n\n<p>To show just how absurd his reasoning is, let&rsquo;s extend his logic to other practices of the Jews and see if Jesus approved.&nbsp; First, the Jews practiced what they called &ldquo;Corban&rdquo;.&nbsp; We find this in Mark 7:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>9 He was also saying to them, &ldquo;You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition. 10 For Moses said, &lsquo;Honor your father and your mother&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;He who speaks evil of father or mother, is to be put to death&rsquo;; 11 but you say, &lsquo;If a man says to his father or his mother, whatever I have that would help you is Corban (that is to say, given to God),&rsquo; 12 you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother; 13 thus invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that</em>.&rdquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Clearly, Jesus did not approve of everything the Jews practiced, especially those that contradicted the word of God.&nbsp; Since we have seen that what these Jews did in Maccabees also contradicted God&rsquo;s word, it would be impossible that Jesus would have approved or believed in such things.</p>\n\n<p>As demonstrated above, it&rsquo;s obvious why II Maccabees was not included in Scripture.&nbsp; The text contradicts God&rsquo;s word as well as itself.&nbsp; Therefore, this passage cannot be used to support purgatory.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Argument 2 for Purgatory</h4>\n\n<p>Next, the author turns to Matthew 12:&nbsp; &ldquo;31 &ldquo;<em>Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven. 32 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, <strong>either in this age or in the age to come</strong></em>.&rdquo; (emphasis added)&nbsp; The argument here is that Jesus implies that sins can be forgiven in the age to come, that is, after death.&nbsp; Thus, he says this supports the view of purgatory.</p>\n\n<p>From a purely logical perspective, this passage can mean at least two things.&nbsp; First, it could mean what this author suggests, that people can be forgiven after death.&nbsp; Second, it could mean that Jesus is simply emphasizing that blasphemy against the Spirit will <strong>never</strong> be forgiven, using the &ldquo;age to come&rdquo; for emphasis.</p>\n\n<p>How do we know which one?&nbsp; If we find Scripture that does not support the author&rsquo;s view, we have to reject it, and indeed we do.&nbsp; As mentioned above, Hebrews 9:27 says, &ldquo;<em>And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; If judgment comes after death, then it is logically not possible that a person could be forgiven after death.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, this passage does not support purgatory based on the very logic of Catholic teaching.&nbsp; According to the Catholic church, purgatory does not &ldquo;forgive&rdquo; sins, of which Matthew 12 speaks.&nbsp; Rather, in their own words, purgatory &ldquo;purifies&rdquo; &ldquo;lesser faults&rdquo;.&nbsp; Their own teaching says nothing about sins being forgiven in purgatory; instead, the person must atone for these sins via the purifying fire of purgatory.&nbsp; If they were forgiven, there would be no need to atone for anything.&nbsp; Thus, Catholicism&rsquo;s own teaching refutes purgatory.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, this argument does not support purgatory.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Argument 3 for Purgatory</h4>\n\n<p>The author next cites Matthew 5 as evidence for purgatory:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>25 Make friends quickly with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way, so that your opponent may not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I say to you, you will not come out of there until you have paid up the last cent</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He goes on to state that the word for prison is the Greek word <em>phulake</em>, which he says is used in 1 Peter 3 as a temporary holding place, which he says gives further support for his argument.&nbsp; What he does not say is that <em>phulake</em> is also used for the word &ldquo;prison&rdquo; throughout the New Testament, so there&rsquo;s nothing special about how it&rsquo;s used in 1 Peter 3.</p>\n\n<p>So, is Jesus referring to purgatory here?&nbsp; As demonstrated above, Christ has paid for all of our sins, once for all, and God will remember our sins no more.&nbsp; Therefore, this can&rsquo;t mean purgatory.&nbsp; In this passage, Christ is simply emphasizing that a sinner will <strong>never</strong> be let out of prison since he cannot pay for his sins because he lacks the ability to pay, namely, the sinlessness of Christ.&nbsp; What Jesus is saying, then, is that those who are guilty (everyone) should settle his sin before he gets to the judge.&nbsp; The only way to settle our sin is by believing in Jesus.&nbsp; The judge here is God, who will punish with an eternal death in hell all who have not settled their sins by faith in Christ, a punishment from which there is no &ldquo;repayment.</p>\n\n<p>John Calvin wrote about this passage (you have to love his sarcasm):<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;But it is highly ridiculous in the Papists, to construct their purgatory out of a continued allegory on this passage. Nothing is more evident than that the subject of Christ&#39;s discourse is the cultivation of friendship among men. They have no shame, or conscientious scruple, to pervert his words, and to torture them into a widely different meaning, provided they can impose on the unlearned. But as they do not deserve a lengthened refutation, I shall only point out, in a single word, their shameful ignorance. The adversary is supposed by them to be the devil. But Christ enjoins those who believe on him to be agreed with the adversary. &nbsp;Therefore, in order that the Papists may find their purgatory here, they must first become the friends and brethren of devils. A farthing is well known to be the fourth part of a penny: but here, as is evident from Luke, it denotes a mite, or any small piece of money. Now, if we were disposed to caviling [irritating or annoying objection], we might here obtain another exposure of the absurdity of the Papists. For, if he who has once entered Purgatory will never leave it, till he has paid the last farthing, it follows, that the suffrages (as they call them) of the living for the dead are of no avail. For Christ makes no allowance, that others may free a debtor by satisfying for him, but expressly demands from each person the payment of what he owes.&nbsp; Now, if Moses and other satisfactions are useless, however warm the fire of Purgatory may be, yet the kitchens of priests and monks, for the sake of which they are so anxious to maintain it, will be cool enough.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p>Therefore, this argument does not support purgatory.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Argument 4 for Purgatory</h4>\n\n<p>Finally, in his last argument, the author brings up the classic Catholic passage in support of purgatory, 1 Corinthians 3:11-15:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;<em>10 According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it. 11 For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12 Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 13 each man&rsquo;s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man&rsquo;s work. 14 If any man&rsquo;s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward. 15 If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire</em>.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s useful here to go back to the &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; definition of purgatory.&nbsp; It says, &ldquo;As for certain lesser faults, we must believe that, before the Final Judgment, there is a purifying fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the passage above, v. 14 says a person will receive a reward.&nbsp; The fire here is solely to reveal each person&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; Yet, purgatory is supposed to be for those who need their sins (&ldquo;certain lesser faults&rdquo;) purified by fire.&nbsp; How is it they receive a reward?&nbsp; Indeed, the definition of purgatory makes no mention of receiving a reward, as it is not even about rewards.</p>\n\n<p>This passage, however, is speaking solely about the rewards to which a Christian can look forward in heaven.&nbsp; In fact, this is even mentioned in the verses immediately preceding this passage:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>8 Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. &nbsp;9 For we are God&rsquo;s fellow workers; you are God&rsquo;s field, God&rsquo;s building</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, it&rsquo;s clear that Paul is speaking solely about rewards in the verses that follow.</p>\n\n<p>The quality of our works will be tested as though by fire.&nbsp; Those works done with the right motivation for the glory of God, and in the power of the Spirit will survive, just as gold, silver and precious stones would survive a fire.&nbsp; For these works, we receive a reward.&nbsp; Our works done out of a selfish motivation and not for God&rsquo;s glory will not survive the testing fire.&nbsp; As a result, we will suffer loss in that we will receive no reward.&nbsp; Importantly, notice the text says we will be saved even if we have no works worthy of a reward.&nbsp; Clearly, then, this passage says <strong>nothing</strong> about purifying our sins.</p>\n\n<p>A related passage is in 1 Peter 1:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>6 In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, 7 so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Notice that God gives us trials in order to demonstrate the proof of our faith.&nbsp; This will produce works that, when tested by fire, will survive, so much so that when our Lord comes He will give us praise for these works.</p>\n\n<p>The fire in this passage reveals the quality of the believers&rsquo; works; some are burned up, while others pass the test for a reward.&nbsp; The fire of purgatory is to purify a person&rsquo;s sins; if this passage supported purgatory, it would speak of a fire that <em>purifies</em> the gold, wood, hay, etc.&nbsp; Therefore, this argument does not support purgatory.</p>\n\n<p>The doctrine of purgatory begs the question:&nbsp; if God intended for us to believe in purgatory, why would He cloak this teaching in such veiled verses as this author suggests?&nbsp; Why would He not simply explain it as the Catholic church has in the catechism above?&nbsp; The obvious answer is that purgatory is a false doctrine.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the Catholic gospel, purgatory is anything but good news.&nbsp; Scripture says the gospel is good news because Christ has paid for every sin we have committed or will commit, and because we are declared righteous in God&rsquo;s eyes because He has credited Jesus&rsquo; righteousness to us.&nbsp; I hope you can share this good news with your Catholic family and friends, and explain to them why purgatory is a false gospel.&nbsp; Just as He has done for us, may He lead them out of darkness and into His marvelous light (1 Peter 2:9).</p>"

Life went on.</p>\n\n<p>My life did drastically change when I was 16. My Mother passed away.&nbsp; My family was scattered.&nbsp; We all went our separate ways.&nbsp; I, being a teenage girl and thinking I was making the best of a very bad situation, got married. I had my first child at the tender age of 17.&nbsp; She passed away at the age of 6 months. This is very hard for me to talk about, so I will leave that. My husband took me away to another state and abandoned me.&nbsp; He married another while still married to me.&nbsp; After five years, I divorced him and remarried.&nbsp; Still no Jesus in my life.</p>\n\n<p>Years went by, moving from place to place, state to state.&nbsp; I had four more children.&nbsp; I now live in West Virginia.&nbsp; When my children were old enough, I went back to school.&nbsp; I got my GED and went to a Vocational College.&nbsp; I got a good job, and things were looking up. I became very materialistic.&nbsp; I wanted all the things I never had as a child.&nbsp; My kids were going to have all that I did not.&nbsp; There is definitely no Jesus in that.</p>\n\n<p>We bought a home, and very nice things to go in it.&nbsp; I had a dress-up job, so I accumulated clothes like you wouldn&rsquo;t believe. My children had all the toys and clothes I could buy for them.&nbsp; Still I wanted more and more.&nbsp; I finally have the good life going and I still need more things.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not even thinking about God now.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">There was an empty house to our right and a church about a block down on our left.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t even want to go there.&nbsp; Pretty soon someone moved into the empty house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guess who.&nbsp; A preacher! I avoided him at all costs.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t getting the same reception as the one that came when I was a child.&nbsp; I had my own perfect little world going on and I had no time for that.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to hear it.&nbsp; Preachers are tenacious fellows though, so eventually the knock on the door came.&nbsp; I had to answer because he knew we were there.&nbsp; He turned out to be a pretty nice guy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>What stuck with me from that day to this is Ephesians 2:8-9.&nbsp; &ldquo;For by grace you are saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.&nbsp; Not by works lest any man should boast.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I always like to emphasize &ldquo;the&rdquo;.&nbsp; It shows the importance of the gift of grace.&nbsp; However, I was not saved that day.&nbsp; I told him we were not &ldquo;church goers&rdquo;, but we might attend sometime.</p>\n\n<p>It is amazing to me now how God began to work to get my attention.&nbsp; I kept on working, buying more things, just as happy as could be, I thought.&nbsp; God had a plan for me and He was about to get my attention.</p>\n\n<p>While on lunch break at a fast food place with my husband, a lady I worked with came to tell us the preacher had called my workplace to tell me that my house was on fire!&nbsp; OH NO!&nbsp; We went tearing out of there.&nbsp; When we got to our house, or what was left of it, it was still smoking.&nbsp; There was the preacher.&nbsp; All I could think at the time was that I had to get my Bible and my baby&rsquo;s pictures out of there.&nbsp; Oh yes, I had a Bible, I just never read it.&nbsp; I used it as a centerpiece on the coffee table.&nbsp; In that moment, it was very important to me.&nbsp; The preacher went into that smoking, cindering house with me.&nbsp; I got my Bible first then my baby&rsquo;s pictures.&nbsp; They were the only things we could save.&nbsp; It was then that I knew God was calling me.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t listen right away.</p>\n\n<p>When we finally got a place to live, with very little to call our own, we got a visitor.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right, the preacher.&nbsp; This time, we told him we would be at church on Sunday because that scripture kept playing over and over in my mind. &ldquo;For by grace are you saved, it is the gift of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; We went to church on Sunday.&nbsp; I remember it so well.&nbsp; The best day of my life!&nbsp; The preacher spoke of how we are all sinners.&nbsp; I cannot save myself.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t work my way to heaven.&nbsp; I need a savior.&nbsp; God has given me a savior.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The gift of God. Christ called me that day, I came, and as Jesus said on the cross, &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo;.</p>"

You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.&rdquo; I love this, even though it is not at all the way I write. It&rsquo;s not the way I live either, and I think I rob myself of some joy in the journey because of it. I&rsquo;m far more comfortable in trips and in life with a well-marked map, a sure destination, planned stops along the way, and a checklist of activities to enjoy when I get there. I don&rsquo;t like the unexpected surprise of a deer jumping out of the bush and into my path. Control. I want control.</p>\n\n<p>I recently encountered some pretty intense inter-personal conflict. I don&rsquo;t like conflict. I usually deal with conflict with dramatic flourish. Off with its head. And if that means someone else&rsquo;s comes with it, well, so be it. This conflict left me on my knees at the throne in one of those sniveling, snotting, ugly face-bloating flip-outs with which I&rsquo;m sure you have no experience but which seems to be my modus operandi with God when things are not going as planned. I accused him, loudly, of always abandoning me. I told him that his word was a lie (I did. I know. But he can take it.) I asked when he had ever rescued me and hidden me in the shelter of his wings, and I heard him reply,</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;When have you ever let me?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Um. Sorry? What was that?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;When have you ever let me rescue you? When have you ever given me the opportunity?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Uh&hellip; do you<em><strong> see </strong></em>this conflict, Lord?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. I see it. And I know what <em><strong>you&rsquo;re</strong></em> planning to do about it, so why do you need me?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Even now as I retell it I am stunned.&nbsp; I almost don&rsquo;t even know where to go next. I just want to sit here in the absurdity that is my faith walk and ponder my own blind stupidity. But that would be unkind to myself (and to those of you who have a first-hand experience with this same kind of folly), and it would be unproductive to remain there in self-recrimination forever. Moving on.</p>\n\n<p>In the face of this profound enlightenment, I determined, with clenched fists and a spirit resigned to the coming destruction of all I knew, to be still. I promised God that I would not do one thing to protect or defend myself. I would stand motionless and I would wait for him to fight for me.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And I did.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>And you did, Lord. You did. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>Surrendering myself to faith in this way was like what E.L. Doctrow said. I could see nothing except what was right in front of me. There was no clear path, no anticipated destination, but only the uncertainty that comes from releasing the wheel and driving blind. (I know you&rsquo;re hearing a country song here&hellip;me too&hellip;sing along if you must but stay focused.) Sometimes life demands that you navigate in the dark and you have no choice. Some things you fully understand are completely beyond your control. In those things it&rsquo;s easy to surrender. What are you going to do about your kid&rsquo;s cancer, anyway? But in these things, these controllable things, boy we want to wrench that wheel out of God&rsquo;s hands and not only steer, but <em>run things down</em>. Clear a path! I&rsquo;m&rsquo;a comin&rsquo; through!&nbsp; We leave destruction in our wake, but we&rsquo;re OK with that because we saw it coming and had grown resigned to the outcome. We don&rsquo;t have that kind of opportunity to prepare when we leave things to God. We are, moment-by-moment, completely helpless to his plan. And that is just plain scary until we&rsquo;ve learned to trust him more than we trust ourselves. Until we&rsquo;re not OK with the typical results of our own attempts at problem-solving. Until we understand that the faithful life is not a life of pain-avoidance, but of strength to stare it down and endure it. My God in heaven&hellip;it&rsquo; is terrifying to even write it. Give us strength, Lord.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;<em>In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it.</em>&rdquo; Parts of this scripture, or the whole, depending upon the moment, have become a common refrain in my life. I am learning, from one childish tantrum to the next, to simply stand still in the face of my terror and not act on my own behalf. I can&rsquo;t begin to explain the suffocating panic that ignites in my soul. The desire to protect and defend myself is as strong as my instinct to breathe. I will only overcome it by the grace of God. But by that grace, I will learn to repent and rest and be quiet and trust. Because he is worthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This feels a bit like going on vacation with my husband (sorry, love). I&rsquo;m just along for the ride and really have no say in the matter. But you know what? I&rsquo;m ready to head off into the unknown where I can&rsquo;t see one blessed thing beyond the light of God&rsquo;s word, believing what I see by its illumination and trusting it to go before me into the darkness until I get where I need to be.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to tell you all that in case you want to come along. I&rsquo;m with you. And he&rsquo;s worthy.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>We interrupt this story to bring you breaking news&hellip;</strong></em><br />\nAlmost immediately after I put the last period on the last sentence of <em>Driving Blind</em>, the Lord put my bold words to the test. I was running errands and on the way home got caught up in a very large dispatch of the local police department (like all of it!). I was surrounded front and back by wailing sirens and flashing blue lights as far as I could see in both directions. I soon realized that they were headed to the high school. My son&rsquo;s school.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your mind has already done what mine did. Gun. School. Son. School. God. No. No. Nonononononono! I did not even have words&hellip;I was truly only choking out nonsense and hoping the Holy Spirit just knew.</p>\n\n<p>This is what it means to drive blind.</p>\n\n<p>Many parents soon joined me in the parking lot of the school, isolated by fear but frantically staying connected to our kids through text. I don&rsquo;t know why we couldn&rsquo;t leave. There was nothing we could do, but as long as our kids were texting us, we felt some sense of control sitting out there on the blacktop as close to them as we could get. It was in the moments between Wil&rsquo;s attempts at cheerful humor, and his declaration&nbsp;that&nbsp;his need to pee was&nbsp;stronger than&nbsp;his fear, when I would falter. I sat there thinking about driving blind and trusting my cell phone connection more than my God, and hoping that one day, in another moment, it would be me trusting my God and content in His keeping. Not that I&rsquo;m asking for my faith to be proven in this way again. Not ever.</p>\n\n<p>The irony in having just written Driving Blind and having this experience was not lost on me even in the moment and it proved to me the need to practice this kind of faith in the little things every day, because I am unprepared. If we never learn to trust God for moments of <em><strong>perceived </strong></em>threat, we will never be ready to trust him when we are in real trouble and can&rsquo;t form more than babble as prayer. I&rsquo;m convinced of this need more than ever. I hope I&rsquo;ve convinced you.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>post script </strong></em>&ndash; I want to beg you to pray for our kids. You think<em><strong> I</strong></em> have a hard time dealing with conflict?&nbsp; Kids who have not been taught that their own lives matter, care not for anyone else&rsquo;s. Their reaction to inter-personal conflict is to kill the other person or kill themselves. As a parent there is no way to prepare for that outcome, whether it&rsquo;s your child holding the gun, or potentially caught in the crossfire. There is no light that creeps into that darkness to warn you it&rsquo;s coming. Suddenly, there you are. We need some light in those dark places. We need The Body to pray it there. Please.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>Earlier this month, Movieguide.org released their 2014 annual report and noted that in 2013, <em>for the first time in their 22-years of reporting</em>, religious, family-friendly, and patriotic movies made up nine of the top ten grossing movies.&nbsp; They found that top movies with faith-centered themes of redemption earned over <strong>400%</strong> more on average than those with a non-Christian worldview. It would seem that Hollywood has taken note and they&#39;re beginning to deliver more of what Christians want.</p>\n\n<p>Or are they?</p>\n\n<p>The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed last week \"From &#39;Noah&#39; to &#39;Son of G-d&#39;, 2014 is Jam-Packed with Bible-Based Movies\".&nbsp; Their definition of \"jam-packed\"?</p>\n\n<p><em>Three.</em></p>\n\n<p>And even those aren&#39;t without controversy.</p>\n\n<p>On February 28th, Twentieth Century Fox releases \"Son of G-d\". As of February 21st, the movie has already sold half a million advance tickets and drawn rave reviews from some big-name pastors but others have questioned the accuracy of the movie&#39;s portrayal given some of the scenes that have been cut.&nbsp; The most widely announced cut involved the events of Matthew 4 when Jesus was tempted by the devil.&nbsp; Apparently the actor who played Satan looked a little too much like President Obama.</p>\n\n<p>A month later on March 28th, Recency releases \"Noah\" and it appears to have even more serious problems.&nbsp; The Christian Post has published comments from one of the movie&#39;s writers indicating that the director is using the movie for \"personal crusades of over-population and environmentalism\".&nbsp; Christians are reacting negatively because the movie isn&#39;t faithful to Holy Writ.</p>\n\n<p>In December, Scott Free Productions will release \"Exodus\", the story of Moses leading the Israelites out of bondage in Egypt.&nbsp; The movie stars 30-year old Christian Bale (of American Psycho and The Dark Knight fame) as Moses... who was <strong>80 </strong>at the time of the exodus (Exodus 7:7).&nbsp; \"Exodus\" was directed by Ridley Scott, an avowed agnostic, who has chosen an \"unconventional\" depiction of G-d in the film according to some sources which is also leaving the faithful less than excited about this film.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is this happening?</strong></p>\n\n<p>First, with the possible exception of \"Son of G-d\", the individuals behind these movies are doing so purely for profit.&nbsp; I&#39;m guessing they haven&#39;t heard Scripture&#39;s proclamation that \"the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil\" (1 Timothy 6:10).</p>\n\n<p>Second (and not surprisingly), Hollywood attempts to remake God in the image <strong>they </strong>want: a god who is all love and is entirely without justice, righteousness, or holiness.&nbsp; This god is no threat to their way of life so they&#39;re OK with him.&nbsp; Or they want an angry, capricious, and vengeful god who has no compassion.&nbsp; That god is easy for them to hate and disregard.&nbsp; This distortion of G-d&#39;s character isn&#39;t anything new.&nbsp; It&#39;s been going on since the Serpent started it back in the Garden.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Biblical literacy in the U.S. is at an all-time low.&nbsp; Barry Shafer of Youth Worker says, &ldquo;The church today, including both the adult and teenage generations, is in an era of rampant biblical illiteracy.&rdquo; His partner in ministry, Duffy Robbins, goes even further: &ldquo;Our young people have become incapable of theological thinking because they don&rsquo;t have any theology to think about. &hellip; And, as Paul warns us, this &hellip; leaves us as &lsquo;infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching&rsquo; (Ephesians 4:14).&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, many Christians in America today (not including fans of Verse by Verse Ministry!) get their understanding of Scripture from popular culture.&nbsp; Fiction books, pop music, and box-office blockbuster movies play a greater role in their knowledge of Jesus, salvation, and redemption <strong>than the Bible.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>You</strong>, the reader, are a great encouragement to me because you foster sound Biblical teaching in your homes and churches.&nbsp; I know this because you&#39;re on the Verse by Verse Ministry website.&nbsp; That&#39;s what we&#39;re all about.&nbsp; On days when Christianity in America seems utterly lost or asleep, <strong>I remember all of you </strong>and the work G-d is doing in <strong>your </strong>lives and I am encouraged.</p>\n\n<p>So back to my original question: What&#39;s Hollywood&#39;s problem with the Bible?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As long as they can distort it enough to make them feel comfortable and make money off an unsuspecting audience.</p>\n\n<p>I thank G-d that you aren&#39;t among them.</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

In 1 Peter 2 he writes that once we have been saved we must crave to be fed by the milk of the Word so we, like infants, can grow strong in the fundamental truths of our faith.&nbsp; Paul tells the Corinthians (1 Cor. 3:1-2) that, as the infants in Christ that they are, he fed them milk, not solid food because they were not yet able to receive it.&nbsp; But once we have learned that part we must move on to the meat of God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; The writer of Hebrews admonishes his audience like this:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong>Heb. 5:12</strong>&nbsp;In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God&rsquo;s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!&nbsp;</span><br />\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 5:13</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb 5:14</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Of course, the scriptures above are clearly exhorting the believer to do his/her own digging into the Word, especially today when we have the full counsel available, so handily bound into one volume (or simply a click away).&nbsp; Undoubtedly, thorough Bible study is ultimately the individual responsibility of every believer; we are called to cultivate the spiritual discipline of studying God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; It is the way we grow in our relationship with God, the way we spend time in communion with Him.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">But notice that every passage makes reference to someone who feeds.&nbsp; Scripture calls us to congregate and gives us teaching on what is to happen when we assemble (1 Cor., Hebrews, James).&nbsp; God made us social beings, and in saving us and bringing us into the context of His family, He wants us to enjoy the shared experience of growing in maturity together (1 Thes. 5:11-15).&nbsp; And He has placed among us those who are called to be teachers &ldquo;to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up of the body of Christ.&rdquo; (Eph. 4:12)&nbsp; The troubling aspect is that the lack of depth of the weekly teaching may be symptomatic of a general lack of maturity in that ministry.&nbsp; It may be a sign of a congregation whose leadership is not committed to systematically growing disciples, to equip them to the point where they could become &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; as the writer of Hebrews expects.&nbsp; We take our cues from our leadership, and many who come to faith in this kind of environment don&rsquo;t know any better.&nbsp; How many times have you heard a pastor say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go into the whole theology of this.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why not?!&nbsp; That is why I came here!!&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For us there is great danger of growing comfortable with the weekly milk, with replaying that first meeting where we learn each other&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; After all, falling in love is such a rush; it makes you all tingly and warm.&nbsp; And cultivating a real relationship is, well, hard.&nbsp; But living a Christian life of perpetual first dates with Jesus can never bring us the satisfaction of a real relationship; there can be no shared memory, no growth, no spiritual intimacy.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So what are we to do?&nbsp; If you are uncomfortable with your current situation, God is calling you to take action.&nbsp; Is he asking you to find another place to congregate?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; That is something you must consider prayerfully, earnestly seeking God&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want to be reacting out of cynicism, or a selfish desire to be served by &ldquo;the church.&rdquo; Read the devotional </span><a href=\"/devotionals/tell_me_why_its_good\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;Tell Me Why It&rsquo;s Good&rdquo;</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> for a nice dose of reality-check.&nbsp; But if you believe you are being called to do so, here is a great article on </span><a href=\"/devotionals/finding-a-perfect-church\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">how to find a good church</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">.&nbsp; Or maybe you are now recognizing that you have been trapped in that loop of short-term memory loss, complacent not to venture any further.&nbsp; I hope not. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Whichever the case, your dissatisfaction with the weekly ration is a clear nudge from the Holy Spirit that God is drawing you to come meet with Him every day in that place where you can get past the initial introduction, His word.</span></p>"

                 "body": "<p>~~You know, some of the things we say are just stupid. How&rsquo;s that for an opening line? I was browsing Pinterest recently when I came across a meme about what an adventure it is to live in this vast world. Someone commented about people who get bored. Then someone else commented, and finally one well-meaning woman posted, &ldquo;I am never bored. Only boring people get bored.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Well then. Isn&rsquo;t she just all that and a bag of chips? And aren&rsquo;t the rest of us &ndash; us lowly peasant types who occasionally get bored &ndash; just so much&hellip; <em>less</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I know that she didn&rsquo;t mean to come across as condescending, superior, arrogant, self-righteous and judgmental, but she did. And it worked my last nerve. So I told her that her clich&eacute; was boring. I&rsquo;m not proud of it, but I did.</p>\n\n<p>You know what&rsquo;s funny? She didn&rsquo;t mean to be unkind. She was just thoughtless and casual about her remark. I, on the other hand, plotted an ill-intentioned response to her thoughtless comment and I meant to insult her into some kind of repentant humility. What&rsquo;s funny is how we reap what we sow. Hang with me here for a bit while I circumnavigate my point.</p>\n\n<p>Besides being mean-spirited and sharp-tongued (and let&rsquo;s not forget, sarcastic)&hellip;I also swear. It&rsquo;s an ugly habit left over from the days when I lived in the gutter. I have always had a good vocabulary, and in this genre in particular I am a master. When I am peeved, irritated or angry those words rise to the top like cream on milk (along with the sarcasm). It worries me terribly for my nursing home days when all that&rsquo;s left is what&rsquo;s natural. These are the things that make me especially surprised that God also uses my words to bless others (I hope) and in that I find a profound lesson: it is the effect of the words &ndash; the intentioned purpose behind them &ndash; that should concern us most, not the words themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Early in my Christian experience I memorized Ephesians 4:29&hellip; &ldquo;Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.&rdquo; Do you know that in this verse, the word &ldquo;unwholesome&rdquo; is also the word the original readers would have used to describe rotten fruit? Paul is saying that we should not go around spitting rotten fruit out of our mouth. It&rsquo;s disgusting!</p>\n\n<p>I have always used this verse like a whip on my back to remind me that swearing does not honor the Lord (it&rsquo;s like telling the zebra to stop being striped!) But I&rsquo;m beginning to understand through the careless words of others and my own vitriol in response, that God means something more here than just not swearing. My words, our words, are not to be used casually, and simply for the pleasure of giving vent to our own thoughts, rather they are to have two specific purposes: building up and benefiting<strong> <em>others</em></strong>, with a focus on <em><strong>their </strong></em>needs.</p>\n\n<p>We live in a sound-byte world that goes past us faster than a fleeting thought. We are facebook post shallow and Pinterest pointed. If it sounds good&hellip;we say it. Or copy it. Or circulate it. But we rarely take time to test those thoughts before we present them to the world as our truth. But folks, words matter. What comes out of our mouths (or post on our social media) reflects what&rsquo;s lurking in our hearts. And it&rsquo;s usually something self-centered, self-interested, self-seeking and self-absorbed.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s return to our random pinner and her thought about boring people. The part of her comment that sparked such an ugly response in me was that she gave not one blessed thought for the fact that her words represent actual people. I wonder if she ever considered how fascinating a 90-year-old woman is even though she&rsquo;s bedridden in a nursing home with no one to talk to and is bored out of her mind. I wonder if she gave any thought to a mom sitting by her preemie in the NICU with absolutely nothing to do but be there and stare out a window? I wonder if she thinks a recently disabled vet is boring because he&rsquo;s bored from suddenly being confined to a wheelchair. No. I&rsquo;m sure she did not think of any of those people. She thought only of herself, and nearly broke her arm reaching around to pat herself on the back for not being one of <em><strong>them</strong></em>: those boring people. But I did the same thing. And I <em><strong>meant</strong></em> to. Both of us were completely self-absorbed and focused only on expressing our own feelings.&nbsp; And when God confronted me with the truth of my sin, I reaped the humility (humiliation!) that I had intended her to feel. (Think Adam and Eve&hellip;Eve was tricked, but Adam <em><strong>knew</strong></em> what he was doing!! We know how <strong><em>that</em></strong> turned out!) I did confess pretty rapidly, and this post is part of my repentance. If God can not redeem my sin by saving some from it, then it serves no purpose, and that is more painful than having done it to start with. I digress&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>Words. Words matter. And not just our words but our intentions in using them. There should be only two: build up and benefit. It&rsquo;s an easy mantra&hellip;build up and benefit, build up and benefit&hellip;but it is behavior that begins with a change of heart, and by taking every thought captive and making it obedient to Christ. Every word we say (write, copy, circulate) begins in our hearts and is formulated in our minds. We have to test those words against real truth before we let them loose on the world. Let&rsquo;s endeavor, you and I, to be more thoughtful and purposeful with our words. Let&rsquo;s spend a bit more time in <em><strong>The</strong></em> Word and fill our hearts with those words so that <em><strong>our </strong></em>words will be <em><strong>His</strong></em> words. Let&rsquo;s test what we think, put a finger over our lips (literally if necessary), run our random thoughts past Him first and speak only after we&rsquo;ve carefully considered our intentions and our calling to build others up according to their needs and&nbsp;to benefit&nbsp;whoever&#39;s listening. It&rsquo;s far less painful than having to eat our words later &ndash; especially if they were rotten.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I ask for your prayers in this matter as it is a stronghold in my life&hellip;like gluttony&hellip;and it needs to be Mastered before it devours me. I would ask you to pray for <em><strong>fore</strong></em>sight rather than <em><strong>hind</strong></em>sight if you don&rsquo;t mind; the taste of my own words grows stale after eating so many of them.</p>"

We&#39;re proud of the outcome, and we hope you agree it&#39;s a big step up from our previous site. Take a look around, and let us know what you think.</p>\n\n<p>The launch of a new site&nbsp;illustrates how ministry in the 21st century can be&nbsp;a study in contrasts.&nbsp;VBVM&#39;s commitment to the Bible may be decidedly \"old fashioned,\" but our reliance on websites, smartphone apps and video is cutting edge.&nbsp;We preach an ancient message, but we deliver it through ultra-modern methods.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/W9Q4G00Z.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:300px; margin:5px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Can a&nbsp;message of God&#39;s power&nbsp;coexist&nbsp;in harmony with testimonies to human achievement? Some might argue that the medium <em><strong>is</strong></em> the message, and so when the BIble is dressed up in modern technology,&nbsp;we&#39;re in danger of substituting style for substance. Rather than&nbsp;depending on the Spirit and the power of God&#39;s word to change hearts, some say modern&nbsp;ministry relies&nbsp;too heavily&nbsp;on slick presentation and razzle dazzle to win agreement from their audience...or so the argument goes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, many ministries fall to the temptation to&nbsp;substitute&nbsp;style for substance, allowing their&nbsp;message to take&nbsp;a back seat to the presentation itself. This tendency is hardly news; men commonly favor&nbsp;style over substance (how else do you explain Hollywood?). Even in ancient times, the wisest orators in Athens were known for&nbsp;their delivery, not necessarily&nbsp;for their command of the facts, as Paul revealed in Acts 17.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So style may compete&nbsp;for our attention&nbsp;in an unhealthy way, yet we need not&nbsp;throw the baby out with the bath water. Modern ministries like VBVM successfully combine a steadfast commitment to the truth of God&#39;s word with an appreciation for the power of technology. In fact, our ministry is far <em>more effective</em> in preaching God&#39;s word because we rely on sophisticated, modern methods to distribute our teaching. The new website is just our latest technological advancement for&nbsp;distributing God&#39;s word to the world &ndash; and it won&#39;t be our last.</p>\n\n<p>In a typical year, we serve millions of individual Bible teachings to hundreds of thousands of new visitors, and these numbers are doubling annually. Could a modern-day <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Whitefield\">George Whitefield</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley\">John Wesley</a> do better? In the end, every Christian minister or organization that bears&nbsp;fruit does so&nbsp;in the same manner: by the Spirit of God according to the will of God. So long as we remain true to His word and His purposes, we may please Him using an infinite number of methods or inventions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I hope you like our new website, and I pray the Lord will bless us with an even greater harvest through it.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>There&#39;s a popular trend in business today called outsourcing. The concept is simple: reduce the cost of labor by hiring contractors to perform the everyday, overhead tasks associated with running a business (i.e., staffing call centers, IT support, accounting, etc.). The controversial practice has its proponents and detractors, but it also presents Christians with a useful comparison.</p>\n\n<p>In the Christian life, we have a job to perform too. We are called to serve God. Paul makes the case clearly in Romans 12:1 when he writes:</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Sanctification Verses: Outsourcing\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/employee-volunteering(1).jpeg\" style=\"float:right; height:358px; margin:15px 10px; width:350px\" />As we endeavor to serve God, we will inevitably experience tests and trials and stress and challenges. We must press ourselves to prepare for service through study of Scripture and exercising godly disciplines, and we will grow spiritually in the process of serving others. This is one of the best kept secrets of serving in ministry: the more you serve, the faster you mature as a Christian.</p>\n\n<p>Since the work of serving others in the church is difficult and burdensome - both for the congregation and the pastoral staff that must oversee the volunteers - many churches have elected to take the easier route of outsourcing most of their internal service needs. If you attend a medium or large church congregation, then you have probably noticed most of the people who serve the church by sweeping the floors and mowing the grass and performing building repairs, etc. are not volunteers taken from among the church congregation. In fact, they may not attend the church or even be professing Christians themselves. Instead, they are contractors or staff hired from outside the church and paid from church funds.</p>\n\n<p>Every time a contractor is paid to perform a service for a church, an opportunity is lost for a member of the congregation to step forward and offer their spiritual service of worship to the body of Christ and to the Lord Himself. Undoubtedly, the paid contractor is the easier and more efficient solution, but is it the job of the pastoral staff to run an efficient, well-oiled machine or to grow the spiritual maturity of the congregation?</p>\n\n<p>When churches hire staff to perform even the most basic duties of the church, they eliminate the need for church members to lift a finger in the operations of the church. As that church grows, more and more of the basic operations of the church will be outsourced rather than placed on the shoulders of the congregation. Not only has the church outsourced the work, it has also outsourced the opportunity for sanctification within the body of believers.</p>\n\n<p>Outsourcing these duties may be easy, but it is contrary to the mission of the church, which is to provide a training ground where spiritual grow and sanctification can take place. Coordinating and managing these volunteers will undoubtedly place additional burdens on the pastoral staff, but these are the burdens pastors are <em>supposed</em> to bear in their own service of ministring to the Lord&#39;s flock. No wonder Paul calls it the \"hard work\" of ministry.</p>\n\n<p>The staff&#39;s role is to exhort and guide and lead the congregation in assuming&nbsp;the duties and responsibilities of maintaining a building, performing the clerical work of the church, caring for the grounds, etc. The pastoral staff should inspire and encourage every church member to get involved while providing&nbsp;the necessary oversight and coordination. If the staff does all the work (or hires outsiders), these opportunities to minister are lost.</p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t have to look far to see the negative effects of this trend within the church today. Many congregations have been reduced to auditoriums&nbsp;filled with passive participants who see the Christian lifestyle as little more than attending a once-a-week service. Any potential interest in serving is squelched in light of the&nbsp;army of paid staff or contractors scurrying to meet every need. The message leaders send to the congregation is clear: we don&#39;t need your participation...just send us your money.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the&nbsp;church that relies on outside labor rather than congregational volunteers not only stunts spiritual growth, but it also burdens the congregation with financial obligations. As a church grows and continues to outsource its labor requirements, it forces the congregation to pay for what it&#39;s not asked&nbsp;to do. Over time, this pattner creates resentment and apathy while directing the focus of the staff toward&nbsp;fund raising.</p>\n\n<p>Looking back to the early church, members were called to contribute financially, of course, but the purpose in their giving was to meet the needs of the church&#39;s own members or to support other churches in need. It was never to pay outsiders to perform the basic work of serving church needs. If there was a work to be done, the church sought volunteers from among its members <em>(see Acts 6)</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I encourage pastors and leaders to resist this trend in their own churches. Don&#39;t outsource your congregation&#39;s sanctification. Don&#39;t burden your congregation with the costs of replacing their lost labor with outside workers. When a need presents itself, make an appeal for volunteers. If no one answers the call, then let the need remain unfilled. If this becomes a pattern, then ask yourself why your congregation is unwilling to shoulder the burdens of the fellowship. It may reflect a more serious spiritual or maturity problem in the life of that body that has been masked by a reliance on outsourced labor.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the point of pastor ministry is to grow the people spiritually, not numerically (that&#39;s the role of evangelistic ministry), and you will accomplish that growth most effectively by teaching God&#39;s word and calling the flock to serve the Lord and the body of Christ self-sacrificially.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, place your trust in the Lord to answer the needs of His church. He will raise up volunteers for the right work and according to His timing. Conversely, He will leave needs unmet when they are not according to His desire. We should respect those outcomes, recognizing that not every church body is intended to reach megachurch size. &nbsp;</p>"

The other thing I&rsquo;ve learned is that there is no way to measure the depth of depravity within the human soul, and in the public high school environment, evil is alive and thriving. (Pray for your child&rsquo;s teachers!!)</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could explain the incongruity of having this spectrum of behaviors in one classroom environment seven times per day; thirty or so young adults represent the entire gamut of humanity in fifty-minute cycles. What I can tell you for certain is that, in this environment, evil wins&hellip;every time. It exhausts the classroom of cheer, playfulness, positivity, opportunity, encouragement, creativity and hope, and leaves in its wake desolation, isolation, and regulation. The entire educational system in our country is built around minimizing the effects of evil in the classroom. Truth.</p>\n\n<p>It could be funny if you didn&rsquo;t recognize evil for what it really is. For example, a few weeks ago I subbed in an office technology classroom. It&rsquo;s a large room with work stations built along three of the walls. Computers are assigned to each student, and their screens face out to the room, where at any given moment the teacher can easily see what&rsquo;s on each one. And yet&hellip; and yet there&rsquo;s always someone playing solitaire like I can&rsquo;t see them. And there&rsquo;s always someone on youtube, as if I don&rsquo;t know the difference between an accounting spreadsheet and a full-color video of a half-naked woman gyrating around a pole. And there&rsquo;s always one student who sits in front of an office document that never changes &ndash; what they&rsquo;re actually doing for 50 minutes, I do not know. Oh&hellip;and then there are the crotch gigglers. Yes, these students &ldquo;hide&rdquo; their cell phones in their lap while they text and giggle. As if there is another reason for giggling while looking at their lap. These students are always very sorry when they get busted and they usually apologize as if it really was an accident that they were toggling between a racing game and their Xcel spreadsheet all the while repeatedly looking over their shoulder to see if I was coming. They assure me that they genuinely didn&rsquo;t know that this would be frowned upon. And unbelievably, they continue on in this behavior the minute I walk away again, and they&rsquo;re equally very sorry the next time they&rsquo;re caught.</p>\n\n<p>I wish I could tell you that it&rsquo;s funny to watch. I wish I could tell you how cute the kids are in their attempts at misdirection. I wish we could watch it together and laugh and call it harmless. But it isn&rsquo;t funny. It isn&rsquo;t cute. It isn&rsquo;t harmless. It&rsquo;s evil. It&rsquo;s the evil in every human heart on display without the benefit of learned filters.</p>\n\n<p>There are two applications that scripture demands I make at this juncture. First, just because the teacher is away and we believe that the sub is powerless to lay on us punishment of any merit, does not mean we should take advantage of the opportunity to misbehave. Our detention, our Saturday School, our In School Suspension &ndash; yes even our expulsion &ndash; may have been deferred, but Paul says in Romans 6 that we are not free to go on sinning so that the grace of Christ may increase. Christian, this is like behaving badly when there is a sub in the classroom, and we are all guilty of it. In every child, in every class, in every attempt to not get caught doing something they know they should not be doing, I see myself. I see my own attempts to work the system, to take advantage of the fact that the teacher is away. I see my own manipulation of truth. I see my own slanted eyes glancing behind me to make sure I&rsquo;m not about to get caught, ready at any moment to toggle my screen and then lie about my behavior&hellip;or apologize as if I completely forgot that my behavior was forbidden, or better yet, justify that it&rsquo;s not technically a sin, this thing I&rsquo;m doing, or at least not a very bad one. I see this in myself, and I see it in the church. Christians abusing the grace of Christ&hellip; because we can.</p>\n\n<p>The second thing that scripture demands here is a reminder that the teacher is returning. We can choose to abuse our freedom to play while the teacher is away, but I want so desperately instead to be found busy at my work, industriously making progress, without the need for excuses or justifications or apologies (Luke 12). I want His heart to soar with optimism and hope when He sees me behaving as if He were right here with me, standing behind me and approving my work. I do not want to have to constantly be looking over my shoulder because I can hear God coming and I could not be trusted while He was away. So, friend, what will it be for us? How will we respond to the absence of threat, to the freedom of grace? And what will we be doing when the teacher returns?<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>On August 1st my family hit the ground running knowing that we wouldn&rsquo;t have time to stop and look behind us until the week of Thanksgiving. At the starting line it didn&rsquo;t seem that long. I told myself that it was totally do-able, but by about September 27th I began to wonder if we were gonna make it. Then October came and September seemed easy.</p>\n\n<p>For clarity&rsquo;s sake, let me explain that for the past twelve weeks my son has gone to school for an average of ten hours a day only to come home to another two hours (or more) of homework. Every Friday night is marching band. Every Wednesday night is cell group &ndash; at our house. Weekends during the past twelve weeks have been consumed by marching competition, homecoming, youth retreats, an ACT exam, a car-wash fundraiser, and a new social experience - dating. Oh&hellip;and church. To his busy schedule add my own tutoring, subbing at school, and volunteering. These worthy pursuits take me out of the house and away from my home responsibilities which all have to be crammed back in somewhere. Not to mention that my husband deserves my attention at some point. That is, when he&rsquo;s able to come up for air during breaks in studying for a major certification exam, working 50+ hours a week, covering on-call duties, and traveling.&nbsp; Are you getting the picture?</p>\n\n<p>We are out of gas.</p>\n\n<p>My friend actually ran out of gas the other day just as she approached the station. She asked on Facebook if anyone had ever coasted in to the station past empty. I immediately thought of my family&rsquo;s physical and emotional state and answered, &ldquo;Yep!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;re still standing. All I know is that we&rsquo;re operating on vapors&hellip;and grace. We don&rsquo;t have one drop of our own energy left.</p>\n\n<p>I can imagine many of you nodding your heads and thinking of your own list of gas guzzling activities that just are our days and nights and weekends. This is life. But at some point we have to stop and consider the Source of our strength. I have to tell you that all this activity makes me a powerful prayer warrior. I don&rsquo;t know what else to do! I have ceased experiencing the ability to manage the universe&hellip;much less my own life. IT has taken on a power of its own and it is bent on my destruction!! OK. That may be a bit of hyperbole, but sometimes it does feel as if my own life is sucking the life out of me. And you? Do you feel it too? Are you anticipating now that I&rsquo;m about to give us both a lecture in chasing the wind, slowing down to smell the roses etc, etc? Nope. &lsquo;Cause we both know it ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. This time next year we&rsquo;ll be right back here shaking our heads and wondering <em><strong>what</strong></em> in the Sam Hill is <em><strong>next</strong></em>, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, and <em><strong>when</strong></em> do we get to rest!?&nbsp; And next year I will have a Senior in High School. (Let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t even go there.)</p>\n\n<p>So&hellip;back to my point. The Source. There&rsquo;s only one station we can coast in to when we&rsquo;re running on vapors and grace way past empty. His strength is supernatural, and it&rsquo;s available to us if we ask. Nothing preachy here. No deep spiritual message. Just a reminder to us both that He is there.</p>\n\n<p>When my son was a little boy and he was way past empty in his ability to cope, he would often cry out, &ldquo;<em><strong>Ha-ot me!!</strong></em>&rdquo; (For those of you who don&rsquo;t speak 3-year-old-Wil-Church-ese that means, &ldquo;Help me!&rdquo;) And he was sure that we would always answer. God will always answer too, and we don&rsquo;t have to be any more eloquent than baby-Wil was. &ldquo;Help me&rdquo; usually works just fine, especially when we&rsquo;ve even run out of suggestions as to how that would look. Mine usually goes something like this, &ldquo;I got nuthin&rsquo;, Lord.&rdquo; And He fills me up with whatever I need to get me down the road just far enough to have to ask again. We think that&rsquo;s exhausting. But there is a sweet kind of dependence in it that I&rsquo;m sure pleases Him somehow. When life has left us empty and powerless on the side of the road He is pleased for us to realize and accept our utter helplessness without Him. He is the Source.</p>\n\n<p>The madness that has become the holiday season is upon us, so gas up y&rsquo;all and keep on gettin&rsquo; down the road. Rest is coming&hellip;He promised it&hellip;it just may not be around the next corner. Fire up your prayer life, take a deep drink from the Source and keep movin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll watch you to see how it&rsquo;s done while I just take a little nap&hellip;just a little one&hellip;not too lo&hellip;zzzzzzzz.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

(Romans 14:11, Philippians 2:10)</p>\n\n<p>But in what way is Messiah a <em>prophet</em>?</p>\n\n<p>In Matthew 24, Messiah prophesies the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem.&nbsp; Because of its prophetic nature, Matthew 24 receives an abundance of attention from Biblical scholars and prophecy watchers.&nbsp; Books upon books have been written about that chapter and I won&#39;t be adding to that pile here.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps because of the attention given to its neighbor, Matthew 23 has often been lightly regarded in the commentaries throughout history.&nbsp; This is unfortunate because, although it isn&#39;t explicitly prophetic, it <em>is </em>very insightful.&nbsp; Matthew 23 is often termed \"the seven woes\" chapter due to the seven woes Messiah proclaims against the hypocrites of His day.&nbsp; Aside from the doom spoken of those hypocrites, I believe there is another lesson we can uncover in this chapter.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Context</h2>\n\n<p>As always,&nbsp;we should consider the context.&nbsp; In Matthew 21, <em>Yeshua</em> [Jesus&#39; Hebrew name] enters Jerusalem just before the festival of Passover.&nbsp; This is often referred to as the \"triumphal entry\".&nbsp; The crowd before Him spreads out their coats on the road and others spread palm branches in His path.&nbsp; Those who followed were shouting \"Hosanna to the Son of David; Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord!\" (Matthew 21:9).</p>\n\n<p><em>Yeshua</em> then drives the money changers out of the Temple (Matthew 21:12-13) and while in the Temple, He heals the blind and the lame (Matthew 21:14). This should have been a <em>clear </em>indication to everyone that He was the promised Messiah of Israel.&nbsp; He leaves Jerusalem, stays overnight in Bethany, and returns the next day.&nbsp; The chief priests and elders question Him and <em>Yeshua</em> responds with parables (Matthew 21:23-32).&nbsp; <em>Yeshua</em> also gives them the parable of the vineyard in which He indicts them for failing to bring about the harvest of righteousness from the nation of Israel.&nbsp; In chapter 22, He confounds the attempts of the Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees to ensnare Him with their questioning.</p>\n\n<p>Turning from those who were trying to trap Him, Messiah addresses the crowds and His disciples in Matthew 23.</p>\n\n<p>First, Messiah acknowledges the scribes&#39; and Pharisees&#39; position of authority (the \"chair\" of Moses) and tells the crowds to recognize and obey that authority (Matthew 23:2-3).&nbsp; Second, <em>Yeshua</em> warns the crowds against following the scribes and Pharisees in their hypocrisy and then levels several charges against them in regards to that hypocrisy.</p>\n\n<p>In the last few of these charges, Messiah points out errors in their teaching with a series of comparisons that all focus on a singular problem: putting lesser things above the greater.&nbsp; He provides an example of their error (or an analogy of their error)&nbsp;and then corrects them:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:100%\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Example/Analogy</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Scribes&#39; and Pharisees&#39; Problem</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Messiah Says</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The Solution</strong></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Woe to you, blind guides, who say, &#39;Whoever swears by the&nbsp;temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.&#39; (Matt 23:16)<br />\n\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\t\t\tAnd, &#39;Whoever swears by the altar, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.&#39;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Matt 23:18)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>They are blind guides.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who or what are they not seeing?&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not seeing the proper relationship between a greater and a lesser thing.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>You fools and blind men!

There is no (or at least poor and little) street maintenance done here before, during, or after a &ldquo;winter event&rdquo; so we just hunker down and wait it out. That&rsquo;s why we lost a week, and the winter concert at school had to be canceled. I was disappointed because my son had a solo in one piece they were playing &ndash; the only solo of his High School music career to date&ndash; and now we would never hear it.</p>\n\n<p>However, due to a last minute rescheduling, the Performing Arts Center opened up and the symphonic bands threw together a hasty performance for those of us who could attend the first hour of the school day. It was kind of a nicely abbreviated concert experience with everyone in casual clothes, but since it was during the day many parents could not attend. Oh, there was a decent turn out, but sparse compared to an evening performance.</p>\n\n<p>I waited through one whole recital, and one performance by my son&rsquo;s group, and then came his solo played over the soft accompaniment of the collective symphonic winds. It was beautiful. Not only did he play technically well, he played with feeling, filling the notes with beauty and passion. Like a <em><strong>boss</strong></em>! And it did not occur to me until driving home how many people did <em><strong>not</strong></em> hear him play.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t even care. It was like he gave a concert to an audience of one: me. And it filled me with a joy and happiness that can not be reduced to words or prideful boasting. His performance was simply like a gift. It was the full expression of the talent he has been working so hard to develop poured out for my enjoyment, and for no other reason than the pleasure of it. (I actually leaned over to the mom sitting next to me and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <em><strong>my</strong></em> boy!&rdquo; Yes. I did. And I&rsquo;m not ashamed to admit it!)</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m in one of those seasons of life where I have wondered at my purpose and usefulness, not only as a Christian but as a human being. Some days seem void of a reason to rise and dress. It isn&rsquo;t that I don&rsquo;t have plenty to do - you&rsquo;ve seen my previous posts - it&rsquo;s just that none of it seems to have any real meaning or impact or significance. And there it is. The nitty gritty. I want my life to have significance. Don&rsquo;t we all? The problem is, as it is with so many things, that we measure significance against a worldly standard.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve taken some time as I contemplate the new year to look back over the activities of late searching for the moments where God has brought opportunity to my door. What I&rsquo;ve discovered is significance in places I would least expect to find it.</p>\n\n<p>For example, my life is currently full of teenaged boys. I live with one. I tutor two. I have 12-20 in my home every Wednesday evening. They sleep here on occasion and sometimes eat a meal. Their shoes clutter my doorway and their body odor lingers in my couch cushions. Their feet have stained my walls. They play chicken in my living room when I&rsquo;m not looking and spill 2 liters of soda on my kitchen floor&hellip; regularly. And I love it. I love them. Having them in my life is a privilege, and a great responsibility, and one I have not treated with the diligence it deserves.</p>\n\n<p>I have looked at this <em>phenomenon</em> of teenaged boys as just a happy by-product of having one myself. I have completely overlooked the potential in it. Every conversation I have, every tutoring session, every interaction is an opportunity to purposefully build up these young men in their faith, to discover places to cover in prayer, to unveil areas of warfare, to encourage godly living, faithfulness, generosity, and gratitude.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s significant. But here&rsquo;s the rub. No one notices what we do in secret, in passing, in &ldquo;casual&rdquo; conversation, in the course of our day. We equate significance with immediately resulting recognition and results. No, not necessarily praise, but we unconsciously ask ourselves how important a thing can be if no one even knows we&rsquo;ve done it, if it doesn&#39;t have world-wide effect?</p>\n\n<p>It feels like playing a solo for no audience. And that&rsquo;s the fallacy. That&rsquo;s our failing. To God, our purposeful attention to <em>where</em> He&rsquo;s placed us and <em>what </em>He&rsquo;s given us is immensely significant, and we &ldquo;perform&rdquo; there for an audience of One.</p>\n\n<p>We are caught up in a current church culture of determinedly looking for bigger, better, more sacrificial, intentionally painful, idealized and romanticized ways to serve God on the world mission field, when He has already given us a sizable mission field that we overlook every day. One that we are uniquely gifted to reach.</p>\n\n<p>The funny thing is that the work He has given us seems so routine as to be insignificant, less than a reason to rise and dress, when in fact it is a solo piece to be played with technical prowess, with feeling, with beauty and passion&hellip;like a <em><strong>boss</strong></em>! Not like an afterthought, or accident of circumstance. Every day that we wake up on this side of eternity is an opportunity to <em><strong>consciously </strong></em>redeem the mundane, and offer back to the Author and Perfecter of our faith a &ldquo;performance&rdquo; as a gift.</p>\n\n<p>Life purposefully and attentively lived is the full expression of the talent He has given us, poured out for His enjoyment and for no other reason than His pleasure. It fills Him with a joy and happiness that cannot be reduced to words. (If you read the book of Job you&#39;ll see that occasionally he&#39;ll even lean over to our adversary, nudge him in the ribs and say, \"That&#39;s <em><strong>my</strong></em> child!\")&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nI would encourage you to take the time to look at your own calendar and reflect on the potential value in what you find there. Consider how you spend your days and what comes so naturally or circumstantially to you that you act without considering what&#39;s redeemable in it.</p>\n\n<p>What solo has God given you to play for His enjoyment? Is it managing your household budget? Do it like a boss! Is it noticing the downcast and sharing encouragement? Play it with feeling! Is it enduring another piano lesson? Give it some passion!&nbsp; Is it wiping the drool off your baby&rsquo;s (or mother&rsquo;s) chin? It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing!</p>\n\n<p>Do not treat with contempt these opportunities to play for God&rsquo;s glory just because they lack worldly importance and bring you no acclaim! Don&rsquo;t diminish their importance by actively looking for something &ldquo;bigger&rdquo; and &ldquo;better&rdquo; to do. Play for an audience of One with all your heart, just for the eternal joy of it, and in those moments find true significance.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

Until then you&rsquo;ll have to make do with putting little puzzle pieces together as I share them with you. This will be one of those pieces.</p>\n\n<p>So&hellip;my son got sick. He was three. He had cancer. I freaked. You can fill in the blanks. Sitting at my dinner table the night before his first surgery I bargained with God and told Him that if He saved my son I would do anything He asked. I was not a believer.</p>\n\n<p>(Allowing a short pause here for you to absorb the absurdity and ponder the potential to the accompaniment of dramatic movie music in your head.)</p>\n\n<p>Enter three crazy women who were meeting together for Bible study in the basement of one of their homes. They invited me to join them. What was I to do? My son&rsquo;s life was hanging in the balance! (Insert another pause for absurdity.) I didn&rsquo;t know whether to show up with a casserole dish or what &ndash; I&rsquo;d been to church, you know! And I wasn&rsquo;t really sure if I even had a Bible. I certainly knew that I did not want to drive across town after a long day of work to some church lady&rsquo;s house, ring the bell, and stand on her doorstep empty handed only to be lured to her basement to talk about Jesus. Golly day! What had I done!?</p>\n\n<p>Now, please know that I love these women for being the tools that God used to bring me home. But let me assure you that not all of them were believers in Christ. Let&rsquo;s just say that our discussion time through &ldquo;The Power of a Praying Wife&rdquo; was not always what one would describe as Godly. Or holy. And some of what I heard there was&hellip;um&hellip;new information for me. It was often impossible for me to distinguish between the BS (pardon the crudeness) and the truth. But there was enough there to feed the fire that God had started in my soul. One night during our discussion time, our hostess made the comment that she used to be content just knowing that she was &ldquo;in&rdquo; (I didn&rsquo;t know that you could actually know that.). She said that she used to tell herself that it would be enough to just be &ldquo;there&rdquo; (heaven) even if all she got to do was scrub the streets of gold with a toothbrush (I didn&rsquo;t know we would actually be doing stuff there.)&nbsp; As I pondered her thoughts, I decided that I agreed. After all, scrubbing the heavenly toilets would be more than I deserved. But she went on to say that her perspective on that had changed and that if there was more for her, she wanted it all. I thought that was very brazen! With a little chutzpah. And no shortage of greed. Still, among everything I heard during that year with those crazy women, that alone has stuck.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m just now getting around to watching the videos from the Verse by Verse International Conference &ldquo;Growing in Grace and Truth&rdquo; where Pastor Armstrong teaches on the value of time in the word, and keeping an eternal perspective. At least that&rsquo;s what I heard. And I thought to myself that it&rsquo;s time to grow up in my &ldquo;toothbrush&rdquo; mentality. Christ wants more for me than to just be glad to have gotten &ldquo;in&rdquo;. He actually wants me to have something there waiting for me. I&rsquo;ve never cared much about what was waiting there. There is not here and that is surely enough of a reward! Bless it!&nbsp; Now I know that I actually have a responsibility to add something to my eternal-reward tally sheet. Something that will survive the test. Something to offer back to Him in gratitude for what He&rsquo;s done. Something that demonstrates my understanding of the value and purpose of the life He saved &ndash; mine &ndash; and that this life belongs to Him, not to me. Christ did not save me so that I could bide my time through this life, only to grovel in the next one, toothbrush in hand. That is a complete waste of my eternity and an affront to the price that was paid to redeem it to His purpose.&nbsp; Brazen? You bet. Chutzpah required? Absolutely. Greedy? No shortage there. I want it all, poured out, pressed down, shaken together and running over! Whatever &ldquo;that&rdquo; is, it sounds pretty good to me (I&rsquo;m imagining the banquet&hellip; you <em><strong>had</strong></em> to know that!!).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Some things I&rsquo;m sure of: that the Lord expects my obedience, that I want to be caught doing good when He returns, that I want to have invested my gifts and received interest on that investment, that I need to be faithful in the small things first. Other things are, thankfully, hidden from my view until such time as He reveals His plans for me. Either way, however, if I hold on to my &ldquo;toothbrush&rdquo; mentality, I&rsquo;m not going to be very effective in my ministry on this earth, now am I? I won&rsquo;t be rewarded for doing what I know to do, nor will I be prepared to accept the next task that comes my way. Here&rsquo;s to laying down the brush, friends! Let&rsquo;s get up off our spiritual knees and start living with purpose, like someone bought us, owns us, loves us, is coming to get us, and wants to lavish heavenly blessing on us if we will only walk around with eternity in our hearts, on our minds, and leaving our lips.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(Nota Bene: Notice that nowhere, and at no time during this article did I discuss salvation being the result of good works. No, indeed, dear reader, I did not. Salvation is by faith alone in Christ alone. Period. The end. What I&rsquo;m talking about is REWARDS!! Yes, friend, there are PRIZES!! The Lord knows how to give good gifts to His children and the reward for our earthly labor is assured. Go out and get it! It&rsquo;s alright, really. He said so. See 1 Corinthians 3, and stay tuned for my next article!)</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For many people, Christmas is a time to spend with family and friends, to exchange gifts, and to give something of yourself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a time of warm memories, Santa Claus, and helping others.&nbsp; Indeed, this is the message in practically every Christmas movie.&nbsp; It all sounds so&hellip;wonderful!&nbsp; While all those things tug at our heartstrings and tend to make us feel good, is that what the Bible teaches us about Christmas?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with these things.&nbsp; But, let&rsquo;s face it, the world wants us to feel good about ourselves, so we should not be surprised that this is the world&rsquo;s Christmas message.&nbsp; Christmas, however, is about NONE of those things.&nbsp; The Biblical message of Christmas is&hellip;much, much better.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Because God became a man in Jesus, the Bible tells believers to rejoice; and not just rejoice, but rejoice always!&nbsp; As we celebrate the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, it&rsquo;s worth examining why we should rejoice.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, 2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. 3 Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest</em>.&rdquo; (Ephesians 2)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">We don&rsquo;t like to think of ourselves as being spiritually dead, doing the bidding of the devil, and being labeled as a child of wrath.&nbsp; That just does not inflate one&rsquo;s self esteem!&nbsp; But Scripture doesn&rsquo;t hold back when God&rsquo;s word describes our true nature.&nbsp; So why rejoice?&nbsp; Ephesians 2 continues:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 6 and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. 10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It&rsquo;s been said that the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; is the best word in the Bible, and that may be true.&nbsp; Despite our sin and being deserving of punishment, because of God&rsquo;s great mercy and love He saved us.&nbsp; He showed us this kindness in His Son, Jesus.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a great reason to rejoice always!</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>12 Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned&hellip; 19 For as through the one man&rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners.&rdquo; (Romans 5)&nbsp; Rejoice?&nbsp; Absolutely:&nbsp; &ldquo;8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. 10 For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life&hellip; 19b even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous</em>.&rdquo; (Romans 5)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?&nbsp; Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God</em>.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 6)&nbsp; Were you ever guilty of one of these sins?&nbsp; Are you unrighteous?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to rejoice about?&nbsp; Read on in 1 Corinthians:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>11 Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&ldquo;<em>10 as it is written, &ldquo;There is none righteous, not even one; 11 There is none who understands, There is none who seeks for God; 12 All have turned aside, together they have become useless; There is none who does good, There is not even one.&rdquo;&nbsp; 13 &ldquo;Their throat is an open grave, With their tongues they keep deceiving,&rdquo; &ldquo;The poison of asps is under their lips&rdquo;; 14 &ldquo;Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness&rdquo;; 15 &ldquo;Their feet are swift to shed blood, 16 Destruction and misery are in their paths, 17 And the path of peace they have not known.&rdquo; 18 &ldquo;There is no fear of God before their eyes</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pretty all encompassing, no?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to rejoice?&nbsp; Romans 8:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>1 Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.&nbsp; 3 For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did:&nbsp; sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, 4 so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">So, while we are all deserving of death because of our great sin against God, because God became a man in Christ Jesus, we have been saved from the wrath of God.&nbsp; This is truly good news, and it is the real message of Christmas:&nbsp; redemption in the God of the universe, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Therefore, &ldquo;<em>4 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice</em>!&rdquo; (Philippians 4)&nbsp; Indeed, this is God&rsquo;s will for us:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>16 Rejoice always; 17 pray without ceasing; 18 in everything give thanks; for this is God&rsquo;s will for you in Christ Jesus</em>.&rdquo; (1 Thessalonians 5)</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">May we rejoice in Christ at Christmas &ndash; and always.&nbsp; For it is He who said, \"<em>Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven</em>.\" (Luke 10:20)</p>"

So in the hope of encouraging someone during these holidays, I&#39;m shairing the following article submitted by Helen Norvell, a follower of Verse By Verse Ministry International.</p>\n\n<p>Helen relates her experience of facing a trial with the peace that comes from knowing the Lord and living with eyes for eternity. I hope it inspires someone to look past their difficulties and to rest in the hope and confidence found in Jesus Christ.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nAs I was listening to a Pastor on TV today, I was inspired to tell the story of a time in my life when I received such comfort from God, that it is beyond understanding. Let&rsquo;s just say it is beyond the understanding of an unbeliever, and even some believers.</p>\n\n<p>The Scripture used in the sermon his was 2Cor. 1: 3-11:</p>\n\n<h5><em>3:&nbsp; Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, The Father of mercies and God of all comfort. 4: who comforts us in all our affliction so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.&nbsp; 5: For just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ.&nbsp; 6:&nbsp; But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer; 7: and our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing that as you are sharers of our sufferings, so also you are sharers of our comfort.&nbsp; 8: For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life; 9: indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead; 10: who delivered us from so great a peril of death, and will deliver us, He on whom we have set our hope.&nbsp; And He will deliver us, 11: you also joining in helping us through your prayers, so that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed on us through the prayers of many.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my experience of God&rsquo;s comfort to me and my husband.</p>\n\n<p>In 1996 I was in church. We were just being seated after the first hymn. As I was sitting, I just fell over to the side.&nbsp; My dear husband reached over and pulled me back up.&nbsp; I was disoriented and had a horrific headache. We came home and I went to bed. I was experiencing double vision and the headache persisted. However, Monday morning I was back at work. After banging into file cabinets and walls for a while, a friend suggested I go see her doctor. This doctor ordered a CAT scan that was to be done on Saturday. Things began to move rather quickly from here.</p>\n\n<p>Monday morning I was back at work. I have to insert here that we were not allowed to receive personal calls at work. If you did receive one, it was announced over the intercom. I had no problem with this since I only used the phone to call the hubby at noon for a quick hello.&nbsp; To my amazement the intercom comes on and there&rsquo;s a call for Helen on line two. Funny how I can remember which line it was.</p>\n\n<p>To my surprise it was the doctor himself calling.&nbsp; He is telling me I have a huge aneurysm in my brain.&nbsp; Now I have to tell you, at this point I didn&rsquo;t even know what an aneurysm was.&nbsp; I asked him if it was serious.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, very serious. He contacted a neurosurgeon to inquire about my case.&nbsp; I am to call him for an appointment.&nbsp; Before I could get off the phone with him, on comes the intercom again, &ldquo;call for Helen, line three.\"</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m in trouble now! I get hang up with the doctor and go answer the other phone.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the neurosurgeon. He says I have a giant aneurysm in my brain and he wants to see me on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>First thing I wanted to do was talk to my husband. He knew all about aneurysms. He told me if it ruptured, I would be dead in three minutes.&nbsp; My friend also knew all about them. From the moment I knew what is was and what it could do, the most wonderful blanket of comfort spread over my husband and me. This is the comfort received from God.</p>\n\n<p>It is amazing how fast news can spread through an office.&nbsp; Everyone knew about it in just minutes.&nbsp; Everyone was so sympathetic and caring.&nbsp; My boss came out to me and told me I could go home.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;No, I am fine&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>The pastor I had heard on TV said it wasn&rsquo;t like God wrapped you in a blanket and sat down in a rocking chair and comforted you, but I am telling you that&rsquo;s exactly what it was like for me.&nbsp; God deals with His children in different ways and this is how He dealt with me.&nbsp; He also gave me the faith to believe that no matter what the doctors said, I would not die.</p>\n\n<p>The news only got worse from here. I went to see the neurosurgeon. The first thing he said was, &ldquo;You have a giant aneurysm on your left optical nerve and if it ruptures, it is terminal.&rdquo;&nbsp; I at no time during the whole episode believed that it would rupture. If God wanted me dead, all He had to do was give it a little thump and I would be with Him. I believe that God is in control of every aspect of my life. &nbsp; believed He had a purpose for the work He was doing in me.&nbsp; As it turned out, He used my situation to touch many lives.</p>\n\n<p>Before I tell you of some of the people it touched, I&rsquo;ll continue with more of the story.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After having many tests, some very painful, my doctor told me he could not fix me because the aneurysm was too big. He would have to send me out of state to a specialist. I would need a team of doctors. So, off I go to see the specialist.&nbsp; He said not only do I have one giant aneurysm, but I have three; two on the left optical nerve and a small one on the right optical nerve. He thinks he can fix two on the left, but can&rsquo;t fix the right one. So even after surgery I will still have an aneurysm. I would probably be blind at least in the left eye. I had high chances of being paralyzed, or just not right in the head, if I survived the surgery.</p>\n\n<p>As I said, I had the comfort and peace of God blanketing my husband and me.&nbsp; At no time did I believe any of this was going to happen.</p>\n\n<p>I kept on working for three months prior to leaving for the surgery. My co-workers were amazed that I was not afraid.&nbsp; God used this season as a witness to His love and grace. I was happy to share. No one wanted to stay close to me for very long because they all expected me to drop dead at their feet.&nbsp; I kept on with a joy in my heart. I knew that God had a plan.&nbsp; One lady in particular wanted to know if I was not scared. I told her no. I believe that God will take care of the whole thing, but if He chose to take me on the operating table, then I&rsquo;m at home with Him, and it just doesn&rsquo;t get any better than that. There were many that I witnessed to, but I won&rsquo;t take up the space to tell all.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell you it wasn&rsquo;t rough, because it was. While in ICU, the nurses thought they might lose me. I remember my family coming in and all I could say was pray. We held hands and prayed.&nbsp; The next thing I remember was walking down the hallway to my private room. I won&rsquo;t say that I didn&rsquo;t suffer because I did.&nbsp; But, my Lord and Savior was with me all the way.&nbsp; He never left me for a moment.</p>\n\n<p>I had an outpouring of love from my church family, friends and people I didn&rsquo;t even know. Such encouragement! These are the people God brought into the work He was doing in me. I live in a very small town. I think almost everyone knew and helped me with caring words and prayer.</p>\n\n<p>I take no credit for any of this. God poured out His grace, His faith and His love on me, which are all special gifts from Him. My prayer is for the comfort I received from Christ during this time of trial and pain in my life will flow out to someone who is also experiencing any kind of pain or trial in his or her life.&nbsp; May God&rsquo;s comfort flow powerfully out to you. Be sharers of the comfort that God comforted me with.</p>\n\n<p>As an after note, He did fix all three of the aneurysms. I recovered 100 percent, and was back at work in two months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Praise His Holy Name!</p>\n\n<h5><em>Submitted by Helen Norvell</em></h5>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

This man had two little girls with him. Grubby little girls. In ill fitting clothes. With wild hair. And dead eyes.</p>\n\n<p>Still, my cynical nature was the first to rise in response, accusing this man of using these children to gain sympathy, and probably raking in the bucks a la Fagan. As I continued to drive I began to hear a layered, simultaneous, and multi-voiced cacophony of&hellip;this&hellip;</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.&rdquo;</em> Luke 18:3-5</p>\n\n<p><em>\"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.&rdquo;</em> Luke 18:16</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;If one of you says to them, \"Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,\" but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?&rdquo;</em> James 2:16</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee.&rdquo;</em> Acts 3:6</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.&rdquo; </em>Philippians 2:3-4</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.&rdquo; </em>Psalm 111:10</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;&hellip;the testing of your faith produces perseverance.&rdquo;</em> James 1:3</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.&rdquo; </em>Acts 4:32</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Do to others as you would have them do to you&rdquo; </em>Luke 6:31</p>\n\n<p>Under that kind of pressure&hellip;what would <em><strong>you</strong></em> do?</p>\n\n<p>After my short encounter with this sad, precious little family, I drove away and cried. For them. For me. For Christ. And because my brain was bleeding! Every one of those verses was the answer to an argument. You can review them later if you&rsquo;d like to infer my side of the conversation. Still, I rejoiced through it all that I could hear the Spirit reminding me of all that He had been teaching me this week, and <em><strong>for once</strong></em>&hellip;I obeyed (glory!!). What choice do we have when scripture is exploding in our heads like a bomb!? Thank you Holy Spirit! Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><u>post script </u>(which is really the script) &ndash; It occurs to me that I sincerely do not want to lose my reward from this rare act of obedience by writing about it here as if proud. I fear I have far too little treasure in heaven that will survive the test. My objective here was not prideful boasting but rather, I simply wanted you to know that the experience of hearing the Holy Spirit is both intensely uncomfortable and deeply comforting. If you&rsquo;re new to this life, hearing from God can sound exactly as I&rsquo;ve described it - like a bomb going off in your head, shooting shrapnel through your grey matter! Other times it&rsquo;s a quiet ripple on the stream of your conscious mind. Sometimes it overlaps so rapidly that you haven&rsquo;t finished &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; one verse when He begins the next one, but somehow you comprehend the entirety of both. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just one phrase resounding over and over. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the abrupt awareness of a fully fleshed idea or concept that you&rsquo;ve been mulling over for a couple of days, or weeks, or months, or years (He is faithful!). No matter which experience, if what you&rsquo;re hearing is <em><strong>God&rsquo;s Word</strong></em>, and it sounds like the <em><strong>daily bread</strong></em> you&rsquo;ve been eating, and what you&rsquo;re feeling is intense pressure to conform to that <em><strong>Truth</strong></em>&hellip;it is the Spirit at work within you (JOY!). And it&rsquo;s a test. Every time. And it&rsquo;s a step toward holiness if you obey. Change comes on the heels of obedience, not the other way around. Argument and justification and reasoning will not relieve the pressure, but if heeded will bring regret. Take my word! Just do it - just do what the Spirit and the Word are compelling you to do and leave the result to God. Do the thing that seems foolish to your own understanding, for God&rsquo;s foolishness is wiser than man&rsquo;s wisdom. In the end obedience to the bomb is the only path to peace.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tOctober 11 and 12, 2013 marked a new milestone for Verse by Verse Ministry International.&nbsp; By the grace of God, we were able to host our first annual Bible conference, entitled Growing in Grace and Truth.&nbsp; Our goal was and remains to bring solid, Biblical teaching to San Antonio in particular, and, via our website, to the world.&nbsp; Thanks to the wonders of technology, we were able to present the conference all over the world in real time by live streaming video.</p>\n<p>\n\tTaking the conference to the world was actually the easy part.&nbsp; To do this, we still needed to put on a physical conference here in San Antonio, and that was the difficult part.&nbsp; Except it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I mean by this is that the Lord was gracious to us and brought us many, many like minded volunteers.&nbsp; God not only gave us the idea to have the conference, He also brought about the means to effectively put the idea into action.&nbsp; This is just as Philippians 2:13 says, &ldquo;<em>for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe experience of working with believers to put on the conference brought to mind how the Lord describes His church in 1 Corinthians 12:</p>\n<p>\n\t\"<em>14 For the body is not one member, but many. 15 If the foot says, &ldquo;Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,&rdquo; it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear says, &ldquo;Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,&rdquo; it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired. 19 If they were all one member, where would the body be? 20 But now there are many members, but one body. 21 And the eye cannot say to the hand, &ldquo;I have no need of you&rdquo;; or again the head to the feet, &ldquo;I have no need of you.&rdquo; 22 On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; 23 and those members of the body which we deem less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable, 24 whereas our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked, 25 so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. 26 And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.&nbsp; 27 Now you are Christ&rsquo;s body, and individually members of it. 28 And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues. 29 All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers of miracles, are they? 30 All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they? 31 But earnestly desire the greater gifts</em>.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tI have never been involved in something so comprehensive that went so smoothly.&nbsp; I had the privilege of organizing the conference, but the work was never overwhelming.&nbsp; Each of our volunteers was committed to the purpose of the conference.&nbsp; The work was not just &ldquo;busy work&rdquo;, or &ldquo;church work&rdquo;.&nbsp; Rather, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, the conference was seen as necessary, as something God called us to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile no doubt it was the Lord at work in each of us, the experience was a reminder of how each part of the body contributes in the Lord&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Indeed, it was amazing to see how God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.&nbsp; While the speakers (Gary Hedrick, Jim Bryant, and Stephen Armstrong) held the place of honor in that they were chosen by God to proclaim His word (and proclaim they did!), it would not have happened without the ears, eyes, hands and feet.&nbsp; So, I&rsquo;d like to give thanks to all my brothers and sisters in Christ who made this possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe had to think about planning (Steve, Kathryn, Jim, Josh, Jerry, Kathy).&nbsp; There was marketing and advertising (Kathryn, Joe), website (Josh, Steve), recording and sound (Sean, Josh) registration (Kathy, Shari, Annette, Patty, Jeanne, Kathy), parking, greeters, ushers, clean up (Mike, Tom, James, Eddy, Pam, Wendel, John), photographers (Lin, Herb), food (Nancy, Diann, Sharon, Suzy, Chris, Laura), music, (Jose, Ivette, David, Daniel, Mark), our emcee and introducers (Jerry, Tom, Don).&nbsp; Most importantly, and something I initially overlooked, was prayer.&nbsp; Thankfully, the Lord did not let us overlook that, and He brought it to our attention and formed a prayer team (Dennis, Ava, Leesha, George, Vernada, Kimberley, Skyler, Lynda, Mark, Sharon, Clarke, Linda).&nbsp; There were also numerous others who simply jumped in wherever help was needed, not to mention those who also prayed apart from the prayer team.&nbsp; I probably missed someone, but not intentionally.&nbsp; If I did, remember Matthew 18:21-22!</p>\n<p>\n\tSimply put, it was a beautiful thing to see the body of Christ work together in the power of the Spirit to the glory of God the Father.&nbsp; I get goose bumps (actually, as a brother once put it, &ldquo;angel bumps&rdquo;) just thinking about it.&nbsp; Knowing the Lord was working in and through each of us truly produces &ldquo;fear and trembling&rdquo;, because everything went so unbelievably, supernaturally well.&nbsp; For this, I am thankful to God and to my brothers and sisters in Christ who helped bring this about.&nbsp; I am also thankful for my brothers and sisters at Grace Bible Chapel and Christian Jew Foundation Ministry.&nbsp; These are like minded brothers and sisters who also desired to bring the word of God to San Antonio (and the world) in a deeper way.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you to all who attended, all who helped put on the conference, and especially thanks to the Lord for making this a success.&nbsp; Lord willing, this was the first of many conferences we will host.&nbsp; As was our prayer from the start, may we glorify God and edify believers in the process, helping all of us to become more like Christ.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tYesterday, while making a sandwich, I saw the evidence of Paul&rsquo;s Romans 7 struggle worked out in me physically. I had spread one side of my sandwich-mini with Mayo (Yes, full on Mayonnaise, so sue me!), but it seems that there was an internal debate sprouting. My flesh apparently thought that I had been a bit skimpy with the spread, while the Spirit within believed that, although all things are permissible, one swipe of the white wonder was plenty. I watched with detached objectivity as the conflict worked itself out bodily. My right hand, which was holding the knife, reached toward the opening of the jar while my left hand simultaneously clamped on the lid. I was only a witness to the event, somewhat indignant, and skeptical that my sandwich had all that was needed to truly be complete.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis example is just the icing on the cake, er&hellip;the mayo on the bread, if you will. I&rsquo;ve been reading Oswald Chambers&rsquo; <em>Biblical Ethics; the Moral Foundations of Life; the Philosophy of Sin</em> (a little light reading for my down time). Oswald&rsquo;s days were far too short in my opinion, because they didn&rsquo;t extend to overlap mine! Thank you Lord for Biddy!! I digress. In the section titled, &ldquo;Rights &ndash; What One Has a Just Claim To&rdquo; Chambers says that, &ldquo;the counterfeit of freedom is independence&rdquo;. I wrote about this in a much earlier post (see Off the Leash) without Chambers&rsquo; elegance or succinctness, but making the same point. A point I need to hear again every day.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere&rsquo;s the argument. I have the right to spread more mayo on my bread. Liberty allows it. But it is my liberty also to defer to God&rsquo;s rule of morality, which forbids excess. Greed, selfishness, rebellion, gluttony, self-indulgence, wantonness, lack of self-control, these are not exercises in liberty but lawlessness. This is a demand for independence from God&rsquo;s rule. Unfortunately, though I desire to be obedient to God, I find the principle at work that I am not. I am in a constant struggle for my independence. One hand is serving self. One hand is serving God. If only I had two hands doing the same thing!*</p>\n<p>\n\tOswald instructs, &ldquo;The only liberty a saint has is the liberty not to use his liberty.&rdquo; And this, he says, is the <em><strong>choice</strong></em> of the believer. This is conscious submission to the rule of true freedom &ndash; the freedom to fulfill the law of God. If this is an exercise in deep thinking for you, as it is for me, return with me to the mayo jar. I should not be a helpless bystander to my body&rsquo;s imperative and conflict, but rather am duty-bound to become an active guiding participant. (The tail does not wag the dog!) The head should rule the hands, directing one hand in screwing the lid on tight, while the other is surrendering the knife. All to the glory of our Lord, who knows what&rsquo;s best. (Though I don&rsquo;t think He ever tasted Hellman&rsquo;s Real Mayonnaise.)</p>\n<p>\n\tI joke, but this is serious business. This is a severe and on-going personal struggle for me, if you&rsquo;ll indulge a bit of straight-faced honesty for a moment.&nbsp; I grew up in a home where <em><strong>no one </strong></em>(<em><strong>No</strong></em>. <em><strong>One</strong></em>.) was to be trusted, and survival came by my own wits and self-protection. I stunk at it, to be sure, but I knew there was only one person I could count on&hellip;me. And that meant becoming my own rule and law, and forging a hard-fought battle for independence from the rules designed to indulge the selfish whims of the adults in whose care I found myself. To say that I have trust issues would not even begin to suffice. Trust the people who are supposed to be in charge? Forget about it. Especially them. They are not to be trusted. Rules? Rules are made by those same egocentric tyrants who want to control and contain and disguise the truth. If I know what&rsquo;s good for <em><strong>me</strong></em>&hellip; rules are not to be followed, unless they&rsquo;re <em><strong>my </strong></em>rules. This is how I survived, and this has become the daily struggle of my life. It plays out in moments when I&rsquo;m making a sandwich. Lay down the knife, or go in for another scoop? Who says I can&rsquo;t?! Well&hellip;let me just show you that I can! And I will! So there&hellip; what are you gonna do about it?! (Said while defiantly licking first one side of the knife and then the other&hellip;with a flourish!)</p>\n<p>\n\tGod&rsquo;s grace is both tender and merciful, y&rsquo;all. If you didn&rsquo;t already know that then let me be the living proof! He is long-suffering as we work out our salvation. For some of us the road is long. Lo-o-ong. But His mercies are new every morning. And every day we get the chance to fight (and win) the battle raging within us. We have the liberty to live in the freedom of the law of God, or the liberty to remain in rebellion. One is love and life. The other&hellip;well&hellip;is not (trust me).</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just finish up by saying that while I fully understand that my peace comes not in winning the struggle for my independence, but in ceasing to struggle, I struggle nonetheless. And thanks be to God for Jesus Christ (Romans Chapter 8!) who will deliver me from this body of sin, for now there is no condemnation for me (or you). Even while I figure out how to get two hands doing the same thing&hellip;lifted high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t*&rdquo;Two Hands&rdquo; by Jars of Clay<br />\n\tI&#39;ve been living out of sanity<br />\n\tI&#39;ve been splitting hairs and blurring lines<br />\n\tI am a house that is divided<br />\n\tIn my heart and in my mind</p>\n<p>\n\tI use one hand to pull you closer<br />\n\tThe other to push you away<br />\n\tIf I had two hands doing the same thing<br />\n\tLifted high, lifted high</p>\n<p>\n\tI have a broken disposition<br />\n\tI&#39;m a liar who thirsts for the truth<br />\n\tAnd while I ache for faith to hold me<br />\n\tI need to feel the scars and see the proof</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if we just keep digging we can reach the foundation<br />\n\tOf our souls<br />\n\tAnd if we just keep cutting all the chains from our hearts<br />\n\tWe&#39;ll lose control</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it feels like giving in<br />\n\tIt feels like starting over<br />\n\tIt feels like waking up, and you know it&#39;s coming<br />\n\tIt feels like a brand new day<br />\n\tOpen your eyes</p>\n<p>\n\tIf I had two hands doing the same thing<br />\n\tLifted high, lifted high<br />\n\tIf I had two hands doing the same thing<br />\n\tLifted high, lifted high<br />\n\tLifted high, lifted high</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI don&rsquo;t voluntarily get out of bed before the crack of dawn, but during the school year my schedule demands it. Since I&rsquo;ve been learning to master my body instead of letting it master me, my early rising is due in part to the necessity of a brisk walk before the day gets started. Oh how I wish you knew how difficult this is for me (plea for pity here)! I have begun, however, to truly hunger after the peace I gain from watching that first tinge of pink begin to show in the eastern sky. And when the full blaze of the rising sun ignites the horizon with flame it is a heavenly reminder that He is still there. He has it all in hand &ndash; the world, <strong>my </strong>world &ndash; He put it all in place and He holds it all together. Day after day. Morning by morning. Sunrise to sunrise.</p>\n<p>\n\tI usually begin my walk headed west and I spend that entire half of my loop anticipating the sight I will behold when I make the turn at the end of our cul-de-sac. This morning as I stepped off under the street lamp, which still burned brightly, I saw something move across the sidewalk. Something flat, but big. Not like an animal, but something I didn&rsquo;t want to squish. My eyes are bad, you know, so it took me until I was right on top of it to realize that it was a great big giant sized disgusting cockroach (think epic prehistoric hissing sized!!). I danced out into the road to avoid it and kept quick-stepping on my way with gooseflesh chasing me.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo distract myself from the creepy encounter I turned my thoughts to prayer and the anticipation of sunrise. Twelve minutes later, there it was: the greeting of my Lord&rsquo;s glorious faithfulness. And twelve minutes after that I was nearly home again.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I hoofed through the last stretch to the door, enjoying the dawn and all its glory, I told Jesus that He is a marvelous Creator and that nature is surely an extension of the beauty within Him. Then&hellip;I remembered the cockroach.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it was as if I could hear him audibly say, &ldquo;And what about the cockroach, Melissa? Is my beauty there too?&rdquo; (Is this a trick question?!)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. That&rsquo;s usually said by someone trying to defend another someone who lacks said beauty. But in the case of our Lord and that cockroach it is truth. That cockroach is as beautiful as the sunrise to the One who created them both because it is His perfect work doing what it was designed to do. Without debate. Without excuse. Without question. Being what He made it to be. Perfect in purpose and design. A reflection of His creativity, wisdom and plan. Beautiful.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I responded to His query with understanding. &ldquo;Why yes. Yes, Lord Jesus! Your beauty is reflected in that cockroach too (shudder). And thank you for the reminder, because if your beauty can be reflected in a bug (a huge disgusting one) then it is surely reflected in me.&rdquo; Unlike the cockroach, in spite of my disgusting appearance, my creepy behavior, and my repulsive habits, I am made in the image of my Creator and He has redeemed my formerly reprehensible soul to Himself and given me a glorious purpose &ndash; to shine like the dawn. Beautiful. Like a cockroach.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

Not everyone can be above average.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m preparing for my speaking role at the 2013 Verse By Verse Ministry <strong><a href=\"http://www.vbvmconference.com\">Grace and Truth Conference</a></strong> to be held in October. My topic for the conference will be <em>Tickling Ears in Times of Biblical Illiteracy</em>, and this week I&#39;ve been researching statistics and trends in the church seeking illustrations to support my teaching from 2Timothy 4:</p>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 4:3 &nbsp; For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,<br />\n2Tim. 4:4 &nbsp; and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul warned the church that in the last days believers would no longer tolerate sound doctrine. Instead, the church would seek to have ears \"tickled,\" meaning the church will seek an environment where it may do and think as it pleases, according to its own desires. I suspect most VBVM readers hear Paul&#39;s words and assume his warning describes someone else. We assume we don&#39;t suffer from itchy ears, because we&#39;re above average. Think again. We can&#39;t all be \"above average.\"<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/what-i-want.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:229px; margin:15px; width:271px\" /></p>\n\n<p>In my research I came across a <strong><a href=\"https://www.barna.org/barna-update/culture/462-six-megathemes-emerge-from-2010\" target=\"_blank\">2010 study by the Barna Group</a></strong>, which documents the growing biblical illteracy among all Christians and its detrimental effects on church life. Barna&#39;s research found, for example, that though most Christians surveyed knew Easter was a religious event, only a minority understood that Easter commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In another example, Barna reported a majority of Christians believe the Holy Spirit is merely a \"symbol\" of God rather than a living Person in the Trinity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re tempted to roll our eyes at these responses forgetting that a&nbsp;<em><strong>majority</strong></em> of our brothers and sisters suffer from such ignorance, but it&#39;s only a symptom of a greater problem. Barna attributes today&#39;s sharp decline in Bible knowledge to the Church&#39;s de-emphasis on sound doctrine and theology and our congregations&#39; lack of interest in such things. In other words, we may not share their symptoms, but we do suffer from a common disease.</p>\n\n<p>Congregations, denominations and church leaders everywhere are de-emphasizing Biblical education and the doctrines of our faith while relying on popular culture and other ear tickling devices to fill the void. In the wake of this change, Barna found a confused and ignorant church vulnerable to false theology and harmful practices that might have been rejected with better discipleship.</p>\n\n<p>Anytime orthodox Christianity waivers in its commitment to foundational biblical principles, the faithful are set adrift with an \"anything goes\" attitude regarding church beliefs and practices. Today, many congregations are embracing a diversity of views and tolerance for a range of lifestyles and practices, while becoming increasingly <strong><em>intolerant</em></strong> of strict biblical interpretations and moral imperatives.</p>\n\n<p>Like the proverbial frog doomed to die slowly as the pot is heated, the church is oblivious to its growing spiritual weakness (<em>see Hebrews 5:12-6:2</em>) and unfamiliarity with sound teaching (<em>see 1Cor 3:2)</em>. Already, Barna sees evidence that our pot is simmering: a majority of Christians are ignorant of key doctrines of the faith, and many appear willing to embrace &ndash; and even encourage &ndash; sinful behaviors within the church body. Soon, we will be powerless to escape the fatal effects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is exactly the trend Paul warned Timothy to guard against, and Barna has helpfully documented the chain of events that bring about Paul&#39;s unfortunate vision. First, disinterest in Bible teaching allows immature beliefs and practices to go unchallenged. Next, spiritual immaturity develops into an intolerance for sound doctrine. Finally, intolerance for sound doctrine drives the church into the arms of false teachers who tickle ears, leading to more unbiblical teaching &ndash; and the death spiral accelerates.</p>\n\n<p>In any particular congregation, the cycle can be hard to detect at first, and often we won&#39;t sense we&#39;re in danger until damage has been done, but the opportunity to reverse the cycle depends on a return to sound teaching, as Paul taught one verse earlier:</p>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 4:2 &nbsp;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Have you embraced the postmodern value of tolerance?&nbsp;Could you be feeding this cycle in your own church, or have you assumed you are \"above average?\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ask yourself these questions: do you prefer fellowship over Bible study? Do you believe a loving, accepting community is more important than a holy people? Do you value exciting music above sound teaching? Have you ever permitted poor doctrine, bad theology or unbiblical practices to go unchallenged in your church? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you are paving the road that leads to 2Timothy 4:3-4.</p>\n\n<p>And what of your church congregation? Has your church adopted what Barna describes as \"a tolerance for a vast array of morally and spiritually dubious behaviors and philosophiesm?\" Barna&#39;s findings tell us that most churches have already fallen victim to this trend, so how likely is it that your church has completely ecaped? Can everyone be above average?</p>\n\n<p>Be watchful for the early warning signs of itchy ears winning the day in your church, remembering that the early signs will be subtle. Have you noticed drama presentations and movie clips from Hollywood blockbusters replacing sound exposition of scripture from your pulpit? Church leaders publicly embracing immoral lifestyles and unbiblical forms of marriage in the spirit of not judging others? Ministry success being measured in terms of church attendance, campus size or financial giving rather than by personal evangelism, family discipleship and corporate knowledge of the word? Biblical precepts of love, mercy and justice twisted into worldly definitions of the same? If yes, then your church is traveling down that road.</p>\n\n<p>Are you caught in the cycle of tolerance, concession and compromise in your church? How can you respond to the weakening of the church in these last days?

                 "body": "<p>\n\tA man in my neighborhood died. I didn&rsquo;t know him. He was an older man who lived way down at the end of our subdivision. He had a wife, whom he left behind to deal with the detritus of his life. She put up signs and piled his life on tables in their driveway and sold it off in pieces. I stood in the middle of all that accumulation and thought about how profoundly sad it was that this was the indictment of his life. This was the story he left behind to explain who he was and what mattered to him. Fishing gear. Camo coveralls. Tools. I decided that I don&rsquo;t want enough of anything left at the end of my life to drag to the driveway.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow this is not one of those sell-everything-and-give-to-the-poor posts, but it is a quiet and ongoing personal assessment. Every summer I go through the exercise of purging, as my husband calls it. I switch out the seasons&rsquo; clothes, putting some away and taking some to the resale store. I clear out the linen closets, garage, attic, kitchen cabinets, book shelves, pantry and those mysterious boxes that have been shoved under beds. I do this every year. This year I took three van loads and donated it all. Three. Van loads. And I do this&hellip;Every. Year.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven my penny-pinching husband would agree that I am not your typical shopper. I love the Goodwill and a garage sale, and most of what I wear on my back came from one of those places. I am not a woman who fusses over my home. (Please! Who has <em><strong>time </strong></em>for that?! I&rsquo;m doing good to keep it clean!) So, I&rsquo;m a bit fanatical about my books, but I own a Kindle! I love to cook, but one set of everything is enough if you wash as you go. In short, I&rsquo;m not an accumulator of stuff. I don&rsquo;t like stuff. And yet I seem to have it multiplying in closets and corners when I&rsquo;m not watching. I do not know where it all comes from. Or why I have it. Or what to do with it. Or how to stop the accumulation from growing. But that is what I&rsquo;m determined to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;ve begun to ask myself what I really need. Not what makes me feel secure. Not what makes me feel current or confident or cool. I&rsquo;m asking myself what&rsquo;s <em>enough</em>? What&rsquo;s <em>good</em> enough? How <em>much </em>is enough? And I&rsquo;m finding that I&rsquo;m really not as good at <em>enough</em> as I thought I was. Suave shampoo is enough. But how many bottles do I need squirreled away in the cabinet, just in case? (In case of what, I ask you?! The end of Walmart as we know it? The apocalypse? This is the mania of my head.) Garage sale jeans suit me just fine. But why do I need 42 pairs, just in case?&nbsp; (In case of what, for heaven&rsquo;s sake? In case all the water of the planet dries up and I can&rsquo;t do wash three times a week?!)&nbsp; Groceries from Aldi are just fine. But why do I feel the need to have one box open and one on stand-by, just in case? (Well, that one is actually legit. I have a hoard of hungry teenage boys in my home at least once a week. There is no enough for them!)&nbsp; You get the idea. It&rsquo;s as plain as the font on the page&hellip;I find my peace and security in my stuff. Even though it also makes me crazy, I am more comfortable knowing that at any given moment of perceived need, I have on standby just what is perceived to be needed&hellip;just in case. I don&rsquo;t know how to stop living there and borrowing the possibility of want, and start living here in this very moment of God&rsquo;s abundant, sufficient provision of daily bread.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tYour issue with <em>enough</em> may be different from mine, but I think most of us would benefit from the exercise of purging. In fact, maybe dragging the detritus to the driveway would be a good way to start. What story would your stuff tell if you piled it up and walked among it? Would it be the truth about your life or would it be misleading? I didn&rsquo;t know the man down the street but I do know that he had a life beyond his stuff and I&rsquo;m sure (hopeful) it was a good one. But the stuff tells its own tale. Mine would tell a story of fear, of weak faith, of self-sufficiency, of pride and greed, of things accumulated but not used, of books unread and clothes unworn. My things would be the evidence of the pursuits of my life and how I invested my moments and my money. It would be my treasure in a heap of condemnation. It would not be the story I want to tell about me, my heart, my God. So I&rsquo;m rewriting the story. With every sale I don&rsquo;t stop for, with every coupon I let go, I&rsquo;m determined to divest of the detritus for fear that one day it will be dragged to the driveway. &nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tA friend relayed to me what happened in her Sunday school class one day. Somebody was talking about a relative recently dying, and how they were sad because they weren&rsquo;t sure whether he was saved or not.&nbsp; Another person in the class, trying to comfort this person, said not to worry, maybe her grandfather was in purgatory.</p>\n<p>\n\tMaybe you, like the person above, believe in purgatory.&nbsp; Maybe you&rsquo;ve heard about purgatory but aren&rsquo;t exactly sure what it is. Should Christians believe in purgatory? Is purgatory Biblical? We&rsquo;ll examine those questions in light of what Scripture says.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, we need to define what purgatory is.&nbsp; The Catholic Encyclopedia defines purgatory as follows:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;Purgatory (<em>Lat., \"purgare\", to make clean, to purify</em>) in accordance with Catholic teaching is a place or condition of temporal punishment for those who, departing this life in God&#39;s grace, are, not entirely free from venial faults, or have not fully paid the satisfaction due to their transgressions.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThey go on to say:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;That temporal punishment is due to sin, even after the sin itself has been pardoned by God, is clearly the teaching of Scripture.&nbsp; God indeed brought man out of his first disobedience and gave him power to govern all things (Wisdom 10:2), but still condemned him \"to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow\" until he returned unto dust. God forgave the incredulity of Moses and Aaron, but in punishment kept them from the \"land of promise\" (Numbers 20:12).&nbsp;The Lord took away the sin of David, but the life of the child was forfeited because David had made God&#39;s enemies blaspheme His Holy Name (2 Samuel 12:13-14).&nbsp;In the New Testament as well as in the Old, almsgiving and fasting, and in general penitential acts are the real fruits of repentance (Matthew 3:8; Luke 17:3; 3:3).&nbsp;The whole penitential system of the Church testifies that the voluntary assumption of penitential works has always been part of true repentance and <u><em><strong>the Council of Trent (Sess. XIV, can. xi) reminds the faithful that God does not always remit the whole punishment due to sin together with the guilt.&nbsp; God requires satisfaction, and will punish sin, and this doctrine involves as its necessary consequence a belief that the sinner failing to do penance in this life may be punished in another world, and so not be cast off eternally from God</strong>.&rdquo; </em></u>(emphasis added)</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tFrom the above definitions, we can see that purgatory involves the following:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tThe person dies in God&rsquo;s grace, so he is going to heaven&hellip;eventually</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tThe person dies with venial sins unforgiven</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tThe person has not fully paid the satisfaction due for their sins</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWhile still alive, the person did not do penance for some of his sins</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tThe person must be punished for these sins</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tWe&rsquo;ll examine most of this in depth, but briefly, let&rsquo;s consider venial sins and penance.&nbsp; Catholicism differentiates between venial and mortal sins.&nbsp; Venial sins can be forgiven; mortal sins destroy the grace first received when a person is saved.&nbsp; Scripture makes no such distinction regarding sins; if you break one law, then you have broken the whole law, James says; the soul that sins shall die; the wages of sin is death...etc. According to the Bible, sin is sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to doing penance, this doctrine is the result of a mistranslation in the Latin Vulgate Bible.&nbsp; You can read more about that <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/sola_fide/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, a person who goes to purgatory must be punished, essentially for unforgiven sins.&nbsp; Before examining what Scripture says, it&rsquo;s interesting to consider how long does a person have to stay in purgatory to &ldquo;satisfy&rdquo; God that they have endured enough punishment for their sin (whether forgiven or unforgiven)?&nbsp; The Catholic church can&rsquo;t say, but they do offer a way to get out early.&nbsp; This is called an &ldquo;indulgence&rdquo;; again, the Catholic Encyclopedia:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;An indulgence is the extra-sacramental remission of the temporal punishment due, in God&#39;s justice, to sin that has been forgiven, which remission is granted by the Church in the exercise of the power of the keys, through the application of the superabundant merits of Christ and of the saints, and for some just and reasonable motive.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIf you&rsquo;re familiar with church history, you may recall that it was the practice of granting indulgences that Martin Luther wanted addressed.&nbsp; One aggressive Catholic seller of indulgences in particular, Johann Tetzel, came up with the slogan, &ldquo;When the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Catholic church was selling indulgences, in part, to help pay for St. Peter&rsquo;s basilica in Rome, and Tetzel was a great salesman.</p>\n<p>\n\tRecently, the pope decided that he would grant a plenary indulgence (a plenary indulgence is the remission of the entire temporal punishment due to sin so that no further expiation is required in purgatory) for Catholics who followed the events of World Youth Day on Twitter.&nbsp; Specifically, the pope decreed:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The faithful who on account of a legitimate impediment cannot attend the aforementioned celebrations may obtain Plenary Indulgence under the usual spiritual, sacramental and prayer conditions, in a spirit of filial submission to the Roman Pontiff, by participation in the sacred functions on the days indicated, following the same rites and spiritual exercises as they occur via television or radio or, with due devotion, via the new means of social communication.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, there you have it.&nbsp; God will be satisfied for the punishment you are due for your temporal sins simply by tweetin&rsquo; on Twitter.&nbsp; Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to have his sins forgiven and receive a get out of purgatory card all by tweetin&rsquo;?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t make this up.</p>\n<p>\n\tSadly, though, some people do believe this nonsense.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s bad enough that Catholics are duped by their church into believing this lie, but it&rsquo;s even worse if Christians believe this.&nbsp; As we saw above, however, some Christians do believe it.&nbsp; Given the definition of purgatory above, let&rsquo;s see how it squares with the truth of God&rsquo;s word.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, it&rsquo;s true that if a person is in God&rsquo;s grace, he has been saved.&nbsp; Ephesians 2:8 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;<em>For by grace you have been saved</em>&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tHowever, nowhere in Scripture do we read anything about purgatory, or eventually getting to heaven.&nbsp; Indeed, in Hebrews 9:27, we read,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;<em>And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tWhen a person dies, God judges them.&nbsp; This verse alone could leave open the possibility of there being a purgatory.&nbsp; Unbelievers are judged and thrown into hell, as the Bible clearly teaches.&nbsp; But what about believers?&nbsp; Can they be judged in a way that God punishes their &ldquo;temporal sins&rdquo;, even if they have been forgiven?</p>\n<p>\n\tScripture answers this question, too.&nbsp; In John 5:24, Jesus says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;<em>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIf we combine Hebrews 9 and John 5, we see that when a person dies, he immediately comes into judgment; believers, however, do not come into judgment, but have eternal life.&nbsp; To be punished in purgatory necessarily involves judgment, yet our Lord says we do not come into judgment.&nbsp; Therefore, purgatory is completely and utterly false, and contradicts the word of God.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, Romans 8:1 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;<em>Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tMany Catholics argue that people in purgatory are not &ldquo;condemned&rdquo;; they will go to heaven, but they have to be punished for temporal sins.&nbsp; If this is true, then the doctrine of purgatory leads to the ultimate question:&nbsp; did Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross completely pay for our sins, or was it only a partial payment?&nbsp; Scripture answers this question very clearly, and it is this lie of purgatory that makes it such a damnable heresy.&nbsp; Purgatory makes a mockery of what Christ did for the children of God.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, we read in Romans 5:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;<em>1Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tTo be &ldquo;justified&rdquo; means to be declared righteous.&nbsp; We are not righteous on our own; Christ&rsquo;s righteousness is credited to us by faith (Romans 4).&nbsp; This is why Paul says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;&hellip;<em>not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith</em>.&rdquo; (Philippians 3:9)&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThis is why we have &ldquo;peace with God&rdquo;.&nbsp; Punishment is not peace.&nbsp; Does it make sense that God would still punish us when we die if He tells us in His word that we have been declared righteous and now have peace with God?&nbsp; The lie that is purgatory would have you believe that He would.</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, speaking of the New Covenant that would be fulfilled in Christ, the Lord says through Jeremiah,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;<em>They will not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, &lsquo;Know the Lord,&rsquo; for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,&rdquo; declares the Lord, &ldquo;for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more</em>.&rdquo;&rdquo; (Jeremiah 31:34)&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tDoes it make sense that God would require satisfaction for the punishment of our sin if, by faith in Christ, He tells us that He will remember our sin no more?&nbsp; Once again, purgatory contradicts Scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tPurgatory does not &ldquo;purify&rdquo; the believer; only Christ can and has done that.&nbsp; 1 Peter 1 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;<em>22 Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart, 23 for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tBecause we have been born again, we believed the gospel (obedience to the truth), and by faith our souls have been purified.&nbsp; If we are already purified, we are not in need of purgatory to purify us.</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps the biggest problem with the doctrine of purgatory, in my view, is that it denies what Christ accomplished on the cross, as well as his sinless life.&nbsp; Hebrews 10 makes clear that Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice on the cross was sufficient for all time:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;<em>10 By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&nbsp; 11 Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; 12 but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that time onward until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet. 14 For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. 15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying, 16 &ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, says the Lord:&nbsp; I will put My laws upon their heart, And on their mind I will write them,&rdquo; He then says, 17 &ldquo;And their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; 18 Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin</em>.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIt is true that God demands satisfaction for sin; it must be punished.&nbsp; On the cross, Jesus offered Himself, one sacrifice for sin for all time.&nbsp; Now, if Jesus&rsquo; sacrifice paid for all of our sin for all time, then there can be no punishment due the believer in Christ.&nbsp; That Christ rose from the dead is proof that God was satisfied with Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, Jesus has perfected us by His one sacrifice.&nbsp; If we are perfect, then there remains no sin to be punished.&nbsp; His death on the cross bore the full wrath of God that was due to every believer (Romans 5:9).&nbsp; This is why, as we read earlier, God says He will remember our sins and lawless deeds no more.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are a Christian, you must believe what Scripture says and deny purgatory.&nbsp; Alternatively, if you believe in purgatory, you are denying Scripture.&nbsp; To believe that we will suffer punishment for some unknown period in purgatory is not good news.&nbsp; Thankfully, the good news of the gospel is that when we die we will immediately be present with the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:8).&nbsp; We have already been declared righteous, pure, perfect, not to be judged, so there is no fear of death for the believer.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Sunday school student was right in his concern for his relative, because there is no purgatory.&nbsp; This is yet another lie promulgated by the Catholic church that enslaves the Catholic to the church.&nbsp; Rather than rejoice always as Scripture commands us (Philippians 4:4), the Catholic must live in the fear of punishment in purgatory.&nbsp; He is fully dependent upon the church to help him reduce his time there; he is a slave to the church.&nbsp; That a person would believe he can simply tweet his way out of purgatory would be laughable were it not so deadly serious, and it demonstrates just how enslaved Catholics are to the church.&nbsp; To believe in purgatory is to sin, and the unbeliever is truly a slave to sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is that Christ has accomplished everything for the believer.&nbsp; We are not slaves of the church nor of sin, but we are slaves of Christ.&nbsp; But the true believer is a slave that is free:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;34 Jesus answered them, &ldquo;<em>Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.&nbsp; 35 The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.&nbsp; 36 So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed</em>.&rdquo; (John 8)&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tUse the topic of purgatory as a way to share the gospel with your Catholic friends so that, like you, they can also be free, indeed.</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do you worry?&nbsp; According to one source, &ldquo;anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older (18% of U.S. population).&rdquo;&nbsp; Seems like a lot of people do worry, so if you do also, you have a lot of company.&nbsp; Interestingly, fear of death is one of the top worries (68% of Americans; supposedly, 74% fear public speaking &ndash; go figure).&nbsp; Of course, there are plenty of other things to worry about, such as our job, being able to pay the bills, relationships, and the list goes on and on.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We know that Christians worry, too.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Because Jesus commanded us to not worry (why would He do that if He knew we wouldn&rsquo;t worry?).&nbsp; Luke 12 deals with this situation:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>16 And He told them a parable, saying, &ldquo;The land of a rich man was very productive.&nbsp; 17 And he began reasoning to himself, saying, &lsquo;What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?&rsquo;&nbsp; 18 Then he said, &lsquo;This is what I will do:&nbsp; I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.&nbsp; 19 And I will say to my soul, &ldquo;Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be merry.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; 20 But God said to him, &lsquo;You fool!&nbsp; This very night your soul is required of you; and now who will own what you have prepared?&rsquo;&nbsp; 21 So is the man who stores up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.&rdquo;&nbsp; 22 And He said to His disciples, &ldquo;For this reason I say to you, do not worry about your life, as to what you will eat; nor for your body, as to what you will put on.&nbsp; 23 For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.&nbsp; 24 Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds!&nbsp; 25 And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life&rsquo;s span?&nbsp; 26 If then you cannot do even a very little thing, why do you worry about other matters?&nbsp; 27 Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.&nbsp; 28 But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you?&nbsp; You men of little faith!&nbsp; 29 And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying.&nbsp; 30 For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek; but your Father knows that you need these things.&nbsp; 31 But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added to you.&nbsp; 32 Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom.&nbsp; 33 &ldquo;Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near nor moth destroys.&nbsp; 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It turns out that the statistic about fearing death is warranted.&nbsp; If a person stores up wealth for himself here on earth, then, according to our Lord, he is not rich towards God.&nbsp; Why do people fear death?&nbsp; Because &ldquo;it is appointed for man to die once, and after this comes judgment.&rdquo; (Hebrews 9:27)&nbsp; For the unbeliever, fear of death is rational.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But what does &ldquo;rich toward God&rdquo; mean?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the opposite of storing up treasure for ourselves.&nbsp; It means that our efforts should be directed towards glorifying God, pleasing Him, doing His will.&nbsp; Only the Christian will seek to be rich toward God, for as Hebrews 11:6 says, without faith it is impossible to please God.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Speaking of believers, Jesus tells us that, therefore (&ldquo;for this reason&rdquo;), we do not need to worry.&nbsp; We may not be like the rich man, who has so much stuff he needs bigger storage bins in which to store it.&nbsp; We may actually have reason to worry about how to pay the bills, how we are going to get our next meal, whether or not we will have something to wear.&nbsp; Yet, our Lord instructs us to not worry about such things.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, when things are going well for us, not worrying is easy.&nbsp; But, when things are not so great, this becomes difficult.&nbsp; So, this becomes an issue of faith and trust on our part.&nbsp; Do we really trust what Jesus is saying here?&nbsp; Do we have faith that He will really take care of us?&nbsp; Or should we ignore what He says and go ahead and worry?</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jesus knows our weaknesses, so to help us understand, He gives what I consider to be a beautiful example of God&rsquo;s love and care for us.&nbsp; He compares God&rsquo;s care for us with His care for birds.&nbsp; Now, I see birds all the time.&nbsp; They eat, they find twigs to build nests, but they provide none of it; they neither sow nor reap.&nbsp; Instead, God provides everything for them.&nbsp; As Jesus tells us, if God takes care of the birds, He will definitely take care of His children, who are much more valuable than the birds.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, Jesus compares us to the lilies of the field.&nbsp; As gloriously beautiful as they are, they live, die and are burned up in the fire.&nbsp; If God clothes the flowers, which are temporary, Jesus tells us that He will clothe us even more.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite these examples of God&rsquo;s care, Jesus gives another reason not to worry.&nbsp; He reasons with us by asking us what worrying brings us.&nbsp; Can we even add an hour to our life?&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t do even that by worrying, then why worry at all?&nbsp; Worrying cannot change anything, so it makes no sense to do it.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, we are not to worry about food, drink, or clothing.&nbsp; Instead, He tells us to seek the kingdom of God, to be rich toward God.&nbsp; We are not on this planet very long, and we have no idea when our last day will be.&nbsp; So, we should spend that time doing God&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; If we are storing up treasures here, we can&rsquo;t take them with us.&nbsp; Indeed, your earthly treasures will end up being owned by someone else.&nbsp; On the other hand, if we store up our treasure in heaven, it will be there when God brings us home, to be enjoyed for all eternity.&nbsp; Though we don&rsquo;t deserve it, God graciously works through us (Ephesians 2:10, Philippians 2:13) and gives us rewards in heaven (1 Corinthians 3:14).</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In His mercy, Jesus&rsquo; parable not only explains why we should not worry, but also gives us a daily reminder, because our flesh is weak.&nbsp; Every day, almost everyone will see a bird or a flower.&nbsp; Next time you see one, let it be a reminder that our heavenly Father cares for us and that there is no reason to worry.</p>"

I&rsquo;m humming &ldquo;All Creatures of our God and King&rdquo; quietly under my breath. And I&rsquo;m well and truly stuck deep in the embrace of a blackberry bramble, the result of reaching for the plumpest, blackest, (I&rsquo;m sure) sweetest blackberry just beyond my grasp over the barbed wire fence. That&rsquo;s what I get for being greedy for heaven.</p>\n<p>\n\tI wish I could explain the longing in my heart for home. Do you feel it too? How I wish it was not always just out of reach. And right now, how I wish getting through to it were not quiet so thorny. This is our lot. Thorns. And a glimpse of heaven over the fence. Sigh.</p>\n<p>\n\tI learned some things this morning in the briar patch. I learned that in order to get to the heart of the bush, where fruit is tucked up in the shady spots under the leaves, you can&rsquo;t wriggle your way in. You can&rsquo;t jerk and jab. There is nothing quick about attaining that prize. You have to<em><strong> p &nbsp;r &nbsp;e &nbsp;s &nbsp;s&nbsp; </strong></em>in slowly, committing your whole self to the effort, keeping your eye on the twig clasping your reward, as you carefully, deliberately lean in and reach out to claim it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tI learned that in the success there is pain. Even now I can glance down at the scars of this morning&rsquo;s efforts on my knuckles: the purple juice staining my finger tips, the microscopic pricklers protruding from my skin, the deep red trenches cut through my flesh by a shrub determined to keep me out. <strong>OUT!</strong> But&hellip;there was&hellip;that&hellip;<em><strong>one</strong></em>&hellip;way up&hellip;<em><strong>there</strong></em>&hellip; and I wanted it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo now here I am. Caught. Because I over reached. Heaven wasn&rsquo;t mine to have today and when the pain came, I sought a hasty retreat. But there is no haste here. Not in coming. Not in going. And now I&rsquo;m snared in each direction &ndash; thorns grabbing this way and thorns holding fast in the other. My feet are tangled in the low branches, my ankles exposed to the brutality. Even my hat is ensnared in the branches above&hellip;those holding my prize. I&rsquo;m awaiting rescue. And while I wait, the meadowlark sings on, and the sun shines a dapple dance around me, and the breeze teases my face, and I&rsquo;m holding in my hands a bowl of the most blessed fruit God ever grew. And for today, it is enough. It will be enough. I will be satisfied with all God offers in this one day. <em>All creatures of our God and King, lift up your voice and with us sing, Oh, praise Him! Alleluia! Alleluia</em>. (Insert meadowlark harmony here.)</p>\n<p>\n\t(Grieving with the friends of my youth the death of one of our own, Marc, who suddenly and without warning pressed on through the veil and left us behind in this thorny place. Dum vivimus, vivamus &ndash; While we live, let us live.)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tRemember when I said that I hate conflict? Sigh. I&rsquo;m about to crack open the door for it right here. Are you ready? (Thank you God that this is not a blog where people can post in Jesus&rsquo; name a nasty rebuttal!) Consider this not so much a theological treatise (with which to whack) but a conversation starter -something to consider as you walk along the way. In fact, let me begin with a question deep enough in itself to give you pause before you consider the rest of my&hellip;query. How have you come about your understanding of Matthew 28:19-20? Have you arrived at your interpretation through careful study, or did you buy the party line? Not to suggest that the party line is wrong, per se, but did you accept it, without personal thought and inquiry, as the only right explanation? If so, go immediately and read Acts 17:11, then come back here to pick up where you left off.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tI know you&rsquo;ll hardly believe it (eyes rolling here) when I tell you that I don&rsquo;t buy the party line. But I&rsquo;m not pedantic enough to believe that my interpretation is the only way to see the thing. I humbly submit my perspective for consideration.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet&rsquo;s see the whole of it:<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAllow me to accelerate your exercise in hermeneutics if you haven&rsquo;t already taken this passage apart for yourself. Jesus has just said that He possesses the authority, as the Apostles&rsquo; and disciples&rsquo; Teacher, Master and Lord, to give them the order to leave that place and as they go on their way to make disciples of the people they meet. In other words&hellip;&rsquo;as you leave this place, win a following because you have followed me&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast time I wrote, I talked about the difference between being sauced and being marinated. Here it is again. Christ&rsquo;s followers have been so completely saturated by all that He has been to them that they <em>will </em>go, and <em>as</em> they go, they will exude His essence and people will be drawn in. But the idea doesn&rsquo;t end there. He also tells them to baptize these new followers. Read what &ldquo;Strong&rsquo;s Concordance&rdquo; has to say about the word baptize as it is used here:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The clearest example that shows the meaning of baptizo is a text from the Greek poet and physician Nicander, who lived about 200 B.C. It is a recipe for making pickles and is helpful because it uses both words. Nicander says that in order to make a pickle, the vegetable should first be &#39;dipped&#39; (bapt&ocirc;) into boiling water and then &#39;baptised&#39; (baptiz&ocirc;) in the vinegar solution. Both verbs concern the immersing of vegetables in a solution. But the first is temporary. The second, the act of baptising the vegetable, produces a permanent change. (Strong&rsquo;s Concordance &ndash; G907)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the apostles and disciples walked with Jesus, He didn&rsquo;t just give them a saucing&hellip;He made sure the His words penetrated. He made sure His people were pickled. And He expects us to ensure the same for those who follow us.</p>\n<p>\n\tOK. So let me ask you, how long do you think it takes to make a pickle?? A day? A week? The duration of a short &ndash;term mission trip? Ah&hellip;and there are your toes I just stepped on. Dance over?</p>\n<p>\n\tListen, I <strong><em>personally </em></strong>don&rsquo;t like the short-term &ldquo;mission&rdquo; trip for many reasons, but this is the primary one, and it bleeds over to color every other reason I have for my distaste. Granted, I&rsquo;ll say it again, I&rsquo;m not so arrogant as to think mine is the only perspective on the issue. But this is mine, and I&rsquo;m sharing it as food for thought. In short: it takes time to make a pickle. To truly immerse someone in all that is The Name takes more than us jetting in for a 10 day Hilton Hotel stay with day trips to the dump. Investing in someone long enough to completely infuse their lives with the essence of God requires a commitment of epic proportions.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus, our example, didn&rsquo;t dunk and run. He stayed. He walked. He talked. He ate and drank. He slept. He wept. He got in and out of boats. He roasted fish. He partied. He grieved. He prayed. He lived with His disciples day and night, baptizing them in The Name, and teaching them to obey&hellip;and <em><strong>He was with them even to the end</strong></em>. He didn&rsquo;t have to jet anywhere. He wasn&rsquo;t concerned with the natives in North America (well, I&rsquo;m sure He <em>was</em>, but hang with me&hellip;). He saw His place among His people and <strong><em>as he went among them</em></strong>, He made pickles. And those pickles made more pickles because they in turn reached their people <em><strong>as they went</strong></em>. Baptizing them and teaching them. Teaching and baptizing with more than words (whack dunk) but by example. Through relationship. With the people in their own sphere of influence. Which eventually reached all the nations (or nearly all&hellip;we&rsquo;re still working on that <em><strong>as we go!</strong></em>).</p>\n<p>\n\tSee, you don&rsquo;t have to leave home to reach the nations. In fact, the custom of doing so has created a false subconscious belief that spreading the gospel is a glamorous and romantic journey of high adventure, and one done only sporadically when we are feeling especially spiritual. It&rsquo;s a fad of the most dangerous kind, leaving the thinnest saucing on the people we encounter on our high adventure. As we depart the plains of Africa, we leave the natives to set up a token cross among their other idols because we aren&rsquo;t there to show them a better way. We can&rsquo;t offer them a more complete teaching. We don&rsquo;t allow them time to savor the marinade. And in the mean time, the ordinary people who are with us daily <em><strong>as we go</strong></em>, are overlooked, ignored and remain unchanged.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I hear Jesus telling His men (and us) instead was&hellip; to just&hellip;go home. He said to go on from there and do the thing with the people they love and the people they encounter on the way. And love them like He did. And teach them what He taught. And let them soak up all that He is through all they&rsquo;ve become because of having spent time with Him. And invest the time it takes to make it happen. It isn&rsquo;t glamorous. It isn&rsquo;t romantic. It isn&rsquo;t sporadic. But it is high adventure of epic proportions!</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, <em><strong>as you go </strong></em>today&hellip;to the grocery, the dentist, to work, to school, to the gym&hellip;remember chicken and pickles. Don&rsquo;t go around wantonly saucing and think that your work here is done. Give &lsquo;em a good soaking in the name of Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\t(p.s. &ndash; I&rsquo;ll be out of the country for the next few days if you wish to comment&hellip;)</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI bet you could guess that one of my favorite parts of summer is the food. Summer food falls into a whole different category from winter food. Ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, ice cream drumsticks, ice cream cones, Oreo ice cream shakes, the ice cream man (Love. Him.)&hellip;and there&rsquo;s other stuff too! Like barbeque! My husband has become quite the grill master (charcoal only, please!) and we&rsquo;ve worked out an efficient system between kitchen and grill for delivering delicious wonders of smoky goodness to our plates. Chicken is one of our specialties. Neither one of us especially cares for the taste of chicken (maybe because it&rsquo;s been so scientifically engineered that it doesn&rsquo;t taste like chicken anymore!) so we have to be creative with how we prepare it. Weighing my various options one grill-day led me to an epiphany.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;ve had several conversations lately that have been way out of my comfort zone. I don&rsquo;t like conflict. At all. Of any kind. Ever. I don&rsquo;t debate. I don&rsquo;t argue. I don&rsquo;t even like it when I have to teach Bible truth that I know will make folks squirm. I won&rsquo;t go into the psychology behind the reasons for my conflict reticence; if you hate it too, you understand. If you love it, you never will (so stop picking on us!!) Imagine my discomfort then, in having had repeated conversations over the past month in the form of debates, arguments, and outright attacks. En Garde! Parry. Parry. Thrust. <em><strong>Retreat!!&nbsp;</strong></em> It leaves me sick and reeling.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the things God has made me aware of through all this unpleasantness is the difference, during a &ldquo;discussion&rdquo;, between being sauced (not&nbsp;<em><strong>that</strong></em> kind of sauced &ndash; bear with me, will you?) and enjoying good marinade.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring one said discussion, I left feeling as if I had been whipped by scripture. You know this conversation. It&rsquo;s all whacking and no love. Let me (whack) tell you (whack) what the Lord (whack, whack) has to say (whack) about that (whack). It&rsquo;s like slapping a piece of chicken with the barbeque mop. It&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got, so you go slap slap slapping around hoping to spread the aroma and flavor of Christ, but all you manage to provide is surface coating, because that&rsquo;s all you have.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow remember, I&rsquo;m seeing this from both sides, (thank you, Lord). I&rsquo;ve been well and truly sauced recently, only to find myself turning around and passing it on. What is that? Is this all we know, truly?&nbsp; Slapping and whacking people with our big fat barbeque mops? My fear is that the answer is yes. We&rsquo;ve been sauced by others for so long that we only know how to do the same when it comes our turn. There is so little effect of a marinade to be seen on our visible horizon, that we almost believe that it&rsquo;s a myth of unicorn proportions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let&rsquo;s talk about that marinade. A marinade consists of spices and oil, and the key ingredient of an acid base. The acid works to break down the meat fibers so they will absorb the flavor of the spices (the oil is just for love&rsquo;s sake). The meat becomes infused with the marinade until you can&rsquo;t separate the one from the other any longer. The two have become one &ndash; the very nature of the meat is changed irrevocably by its exposure to the marinade. Clear enough? Do you see where I&rsquo;m going? Consider the aroma of Christ. Think of the fruit of the Holy Spirit. Reflect on the character of God. Have you absorbed Him? Have you allowed Him to change the nature and flavor of your life? If you have soaked in the brine of Christ long enough, you will not need to go about saucing everything in sight! Others will breathe the fragrance of your life and will <em><strong>know</strong></em> what you believe&hellip;what I believe. We will finally be able to put away our mops and know that, through and through, our lives will be a testimony to our God.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere it is in theory. The sad fact is that it is so very hard to stop saucing and to become a sponge for the marinade. Those other conversations I&rsquo;ve had recently? An exercise in humility and discovering that all I truly know how to do is whack at people with my sauce because I have not absorbed the flavor and aroma&hellip;the nature of Christ&hellip;to any discernable degree. If you must <strong>ask</strong> what I believe, and I must <strong>debate</strong> the issue with you because I haven&rsquo;t proven it to be true in the way I live, then I have failed in my duty to surrender to the marinade.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don&rsquo;t like being sauced, and I really want to stop saucing others. It&rsquo;s messy. It stains your shirt. It&rsquo;s only surface dressing anyway; it doesn&rsquo;t really get to the heart of things. It can&rsquo;t&hellip;its nature is only to cover up the truth that underneath is the nasty taste of flesh. So if you&rsquo;ve been the victim of any recent saucing at my hand, I&rsquo;m truly sorry for the stain I left on your shirt and for any scars I left from&nbsp;whacking you with my mop. What we both need is to be thoroughly marinated so we can experience the change that comes from a long soak in the goodness of God. I&rsquo;ll go first.&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tLast week my husband was traveling with his job. Sporadically, he is required to do that for days at a time, and I have learned that during those times he still very much expects to be a part of &ldquo;the process&rdquo; of our home life. In other words, just because he&rsquo;s gone, he doesn&rsquo;t expect, nor want me to assume his role in addition to my own; he&rsquo;s not abdicating.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the second day that my husband was gone last week, my son &ndash; how to say this &ndash; crossed a major line. This was no barely visible line in the sand. This was a well dug trench, a-river-runs-through-it-cross-at-your-own-peril wide and deep demarcation of acceptable behavior. As a result, I found myself on the phone with my husband negotiating consequences. The situation was serious enough that my husband decided to cut his trip short and come home the following day, a full business day early. In the mean time, he laid out a list of rules for Wil that left him barely moving about the house without explicit permission to do so. His choices were&hellip;this and nothing. You get my drift?</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Wil shrunk under the weight of his own guilt and the resulting rules heaped upon him, all he could think about was when his daddy would be home. Now don&rsquo;t misunderstand. This was not the &ldquo;wait-until-your-dad-gets-home&rdquo; anticipation.&nbsp; My husband is not the disciplinarian. I am. I have inflicted every <strike>beating </strike>spanking. I have enforced every rule. I have monitored every disciplinary action. That has clearly defined the parental roles for Wil so that he fears me <em><strong>in a uniquely special way</strong></em> (can you tell I&rsquo;m still a little peeved with him?) and he fears disappointing his daddy. I knew that what my son needed that day, that moment, was his dad&rsquo;s forgiveness. He needed to see his face and know that love still won, that anger had not erased all previous traces of affection, that disappointment had not wrecked the relationship. But what he was going to get in the mean time was a list of rules to live by.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I watched my son wrestle with this conundrum, and I grieved both his betrayal and his pain, I suddenly understood something about our God in a new way and with fresh understanding &ndash; His Law could not replace His presence.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. </em>(Galatians 3:23-25)</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming&mdash;not the realities themselves</em>. (Hebrews 10:1)</p>\n<p>\n\tThe rules established for my son were a guardian for him until his daddy got home but they could not replace the man himself. The rules reflected the love that was behind them but they could not replace that love. The rules would hedge him, protect him and guide him, and punishment (not discipline!) would be the result of an infraction, and in place of the man, the rules worked for that 24 hour period. But they were only there to stop the bleeding. They could change the behavior, but they couldn&rsquo;t heal Wil&rsquo;s heart.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen my husband walked through the door the next day he gathered Wil in his arms and held him, and through his own hurt, he loved his boy. The rules haven&rsquo;t changed much since then nor have they gone away; we realize that for his own protection they need to remain in place. But the rules don&rsquo;t replace the relationship. Dad is here now. And somehow, that makes a difference. That makes<em> the </em>difference.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you Jesus! Thank you Father! For those of us who have not previously known what it&rsquo;s like to live under the guardianship of rules, who haven&#39;t known the tender love of a father which will win out over anger and disappointment, who until now have not known the feeling of being gathered into the arms of living grace to experience mercy&hellip;thank you. Thank you for dropping everything to come rescue us with your love.&nbsp; Now teach us to cling to you like a repentant son to his loving father.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tIn response to my article on Rob Bell and his unbiblical beliefs about hell, a reader sent us the following email:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;I could not help but see your comments about Rob Bell.&nbsp; I have not read Rob Bell&rsquo;s book Love Wins.&nbsp; I was just wondering.&nbsp; I grew up in Nepal just above India where most of the people are Hindu.&nbsp; Having spent much time with these people and witnessing their loving caring nature and their belief in God.&nbsp; I find it very difficult to believe that they are going to hell.&nbsp; It does not make sense.&nbsp; One could quote the Bible literally and say they are going to hell but of course that can&rsquo;t be the case because they may have never even had a chance to read the gospels.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tSince this is a person who reads our website, I assume (and this could definitely be a bad assumption) this person is a Christian.&nbsp; If so, he clearly has an unbiblical view of Scripture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I also assume (again, perhaps wrongly) that other Christians may have this same unbiblical understanding of hell.&nbsp; Therefore, I thought it would be worth showing, again, what the Bible teaches about hell.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore doing that, I thought it would be interesting to point out that the Catholic church essentially teaches this same false belief.&nbsp; Paragraph 847 of the &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; Catholic catechism says, &ldquo;Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sounds like the email above, no?</p>\n<p>\n\tEssentially, both our friend and the Catholic church are saying that if one believes in God, seeks God, obeys his conscience, and tries to do God&rsquo;s will, then that person will be saved if he does not hear the gospel.&nbsp; If that is your view, then the absolute best thing you can do is to NEVER preach the gospel to such a person.&nbsp; Why risk that person rejecting the gospel if it&rsquo;s a fact that, apart from hearing the gospel, that person is going to heaven?&nbsp; It would be cruel to share the gospel with such a person and risk his salvation!&nbsp; Yet, Jesus commanded us to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19), which implies preaching the gospel to all peoples.&nbsp; Who is right?</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we examine our friend&rsquo;s view and the Catholic church&rsquo;s view, there are basically three things they are assuming about people whom God will not send to hell:&nbsp; 1) they believe in God; 2) they are basically good (e.g., loving, caring, seek God with a sincere heart, try to do God&rsquo;s will by following their conscience); and 3) they have not heard the gospel.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s look at what Scripture says about each one of these.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst is the assumption that people who believe in God will go to heaven.&nbsp; Does the Bible teach that if a person believes in God he will be saved?&nbsp; Scripture does indeed say that a person who comes to God must believe that He is, but that&rsquo;s not all it says.&nbsp; Hebrews 11:6 says, &ldquo;<em>And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The key point here is that a person must have faith, which, you&rsquo;ll recall, is the gift of God (Ephesians 2:8); that is, those who will have eternal life must have faith, and God is the one who gives faith to those He chooses.&nbsp; Thus, mere belief in God is not sufficient for salvation.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, James 2:19 says, &ldquo;<em>You believe that God is one.&nbsp; You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Demons believe in God, but they will not experience salvation; rather, they will be thrown into the lake of fire.&nbsp; So, we see that the Bible teaches that belief in God, by itself, does not save a person.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond is the rather common, secular, assumption that people are basically good.&nbsp; Since that&rsquo;s the case, and since God is a God of love, then of course He will not send good people to hell.&nbsp; The fundamental problem with this view is that Scripture clearly teaches that people are not good.&nbsp; Because of Adam&rsquo;s Fall, we are all born sinners (Romans 5:12).&nbsp; Because we are all born sinners, we all sin; that&rsquo;s what sinners do.&nbsp; We like to compare ourselves to other people so we appear &ldquo;good&rdquo;, and surely some people are not as bad as they could be.&nbsp; But good in the Biblical sense means perfect, holy, without sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are not without sin.&nbsp; Here is how Scripture describes all of humanity apart from faith in Christ:</p>\n<p>\n\tRomans 1:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 19 because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them. 20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. 21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp; Our email friend is right, people know God, but they do not honor Him as God or give Him the thanks He alone is due.&nbsp; Furthermore, men always seek to worship something, but they exchange the glory of God for a god of their own making.&nbsp; This is especially evident in Hinduism.</p>\n<p>\n\tSomeone may say, &ldquo;Yes, but Romans 2 says that those who persevere in doing good will have eternal life (vs. 7, 10).&rdquo;&nbsp; True, but keep reading.</p>\n<p>\n\tRomans 3 says,</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;<em>9 What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin; 10 as it is written,</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;There is none righteous, not even one;<br />\n\t11 There is none who understands,<br />\n\tThere is none who seeks for God;<br />\n\t12 All have turned aside, together they have become useless;<br />\n\tThere is none who does good,<br />\n\tThere is not even one.&rdquo;<br />\n\t13 &ldquo;Their throat is an open grave,<br />\n\tWith their tongues they keep deceiving,&rdquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;The poison of asps is under their lips&rdquo;;<br />\n\t14 &ldquo;Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness&rdquo;;<br />\n\t15 &ldquo;Their feet are swift to shed blood,<br />\n\t16 Destruction and misery are in their paths,<br />\n\t17 And the path of peace they have not known.&rdquo;<br />\n\t18 &ldquo;There is no fear of God before their eyes</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tScripture makes clear that we are ALL under sin, there is NONE righteous, no NOT ONE.&nbsp; In and of ourselves, apart from faith in Christ, we are unrighteous, we are not good, and we do not seek God.&nbsp; This could not be more clear:&nbsp; Scripture says people are NOT basically good.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, what about those who have never heard the gospel?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t they get to go to heaven?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that a valid &ldquo;excuse&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a word, no.&nbsp; Again, Romans 1:20:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The teaching of Scripture is that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23).&nbsp; They know God exists by His creation, but do not worship Him as God, so all are without excuse.&nbsp; Thus, the clear teaching of Scripture is that we all deserve hell because we are all sinners.&nbsp; Whether or not we hear the gospel has nothing to do with our guilt before God; we are ALL guilty.&nbsp; When God saves someone, He is like a governor pardoning the guilty on death row, if you will.&nbsp; The person is guilty and does not deserve pardon, but is released solely at the decision of the governor.</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, salvation is determined by God.&nbsp; Therefore, the argument that those who do not hear the gospel should be saved is irrelevant.&nbsp; God chooses who is saved and who is not saved.&nbsp; To the extent there is even one person among a long lost tribe who has never heard the gospel, God will ensure this person hears the gospel and is saved.&nbsp; Nothing is too difficult, and nothing is impossible for God.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis leads some to say that if I&rsquo;m born a sinner because of what Adam did, and God is the one who determines whether or not I am saved, then God is not fair.&nbsp; Scripture addresses this concern, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tRomans 9 says, &ldquo;<em>10 And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac; 11 for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God&rsquo;s purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls, 12 it was said to her, &ldquo;The older will serve the younger.&rdquo; 13 Just as it is written, &ldquo;Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.&rdquo;&nbsp; 14 What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!&nbsp; 15 For He says to Moses, &ldquo;I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.&rdquo;&nbsp; 16 So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.&nbsp; 17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &ldquo;For this very purpose I raised you up, to demonstrate My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; 18 So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.&nbsp; 19 You will say to me then, &ldquo;Why does He still find fault?&nbsp; For who resists His will?&rdquo;&nbsp; 20 On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God?&nbsp; The thing molded will not say to the molder, &ldquo;Why did you make me like this,&rdquo; will it?&nbsp; 21 Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?&nbsp; 22 What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?&nbsp; 23 And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory, 24 even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tGod desires to demonstrate to His creation all of His attributes.&nbsp; This includes not only grace, mercy and love, but also justice and wrath.&nbsp; It is not up to the creature to question the motives of the Creator, who is forever blessed.&nbsp; Besides, if you really want fairness, then true fairness would be for God to send us all to hell.&nbsp; That He shows mercy on some is all of grace.</p>\n<p>\n\tRemember, although God showed us mercy, it was not without a cost.&nbsp; God still punished our sin, because He is a just God.&nbsp; Instead of believers being justly punished, the wrath of God that we deserved was poured out on Jesus on the cross.&nbsp; And it is by Christ&rsquo;s life of obedience that we are made righteous.&nbsp; This makes God both just and the justifier, as Romans 3 says, &ldquo;<em>24 being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; 25 whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith.&nbsp; This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed; 26 for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tLike Job and his friends who darken counsel without knowledge, Scripture renders silent both our email friend and the Catholic church.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tThere was a huge storm here Monday night. You might remember it because it&rsquo;s the same one that demolished Moore, Oklahoma. It swept across that state, roared into ours, and broadsided my home, and subsequently, my husband and son as they drove home from Wil&rsquo;s first night on his first job.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday it rained. All day.</p>\n<p>\n\tI went to the grocery store Wednesday. In line at Aldi, I was behind a woman pushing a cart and pulling a walker. She had some trouble unloading onto the belt. Behind me and my week&rsquo;s worth was a woman with only an arm full. In the parking lot was a homeless man who asked me for a ride somewhere, and money.</p>\n<p>\n\tThursday I had a little email exchange with one of my son&rsquo;s teachers who had treated him unfairly.</p>\n<p>\n\tFriday I had a meeting with a woman from my church. My last meeting with her felt like an inquisition instead of a friendly getting-to-know-you lunch shared by two potential friends and daughters of Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring my walk yesterday morning I saw a lawn crew beginning work on the neighbor&rsquo;s lawn. The man in uniform was waving his arms around at the man in dirty jeans and grubby white tee-shirt. He kept turning this way and that as he barked orders at the Hispanic man who was <strong>desperately</strong> trying to keep up &ndash; with the physicality and the language.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday as I was driving toward the farm around the corner from my house I saw that their goats were on the road.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat was your week like? Did it include selling all your possessions and giving the money to the poor? Did you just return from a week in the Amazon tracking down lost tribes so that you could share the gospel? Did you &ldquo;take India for God&rdquo; by rescuing an orphan from the sex-trade? Maybe, oh I know, maybe you put the finishing touches on your translation of the New Testament into Marshallese.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tNo?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tNone of that?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tReally?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tWell, what good are you?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tSeriously.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t<strong>I. Am. So. Tired. Of. This. Message.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tYou know what I did this week? I prayed for my husband and son. Urgently. Authentically. Desperately. And with the understanding that in God&rsquo;s sovereignty I might lose them all. I thanked God for His bountiful provision, His faithful protection, and His sovereign license. And I interceded for people whose children are dead.</p>\n<p>\n\tI trusted God that there is purpose in every day. Even rainy days that make you want to cry. All day.</p>\n<p>\n\tI helped a lady unload her grocery cart and let another go ahead of me in line. Then I apologized profusely and wrestled with God because all I had was a debit card and an unmitigated standing order that I WILL NOT GIVE RIDES TO STRANGERS.</p>\n<p>\n\tI blew it. And I asked God&rsquo;s forgiveness. And found it.</p>\n<p>\n\tI prayed. And prayed some more. And went in faith. And was blessed.</p>\n<p>\n\tI did nothing to intervene in the human drama common to my community. I wished a uniformed man a good morning, and hoped that it would be&hellip;for the sake of the man who had lost his dignity.</p>\n<p>\n\tI knocked on a neighbor&rsquo;s door to tell them their goats were in the road.</p>\n<p>\n\tI won some. I lost some. But none of it was insignificant. It was exactly the week God planned for me. And there is nothing in His plan that is insignificant. I did not have to go looking for something significant to do. There was no need to seek out something radical to make me &ldquo;really&rdquo; a follower of Christ. I just had to breathe in and breathe out.</p>\n<p>\n\tI want you to think about your week. For me, the most radical things God asked me to do were to give up my place in line, forgive someone who hurt me, overlook an offense and seek a humble attitude, give over everything I own and the people I love to His care, fling myself prostrate at the altar for people I don&rsquo;t even know, act in love toward a neighbor and be happy anyway!!!</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat about that is <strong>not</strong> radical?</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy does that have no value to the American church right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy does radical have to look like it&rsquo;s all about me? (<strong>I</strong> give. <strong>I </strong>go. <strong>I</strong> do. <strong>I</strong> build. <strong>I</strong> teach. <strong>I</strong> serve. <strong>I</strong> lead. <strong>I</strong> adopt. <strong>I </strong>rescue. <strong>I </strong>share. <strong>I. I. I. I </strong>do these things to prove to others that <strong>I</strong> am really a follower of Christ. So&hellip;follow <strong>me</strong>.)</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy isn&rsquo;t my common daily obedience an act of crazy love?</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy hasn&rsquo;t loving my family, submitting to my husband and keeping my home become an irresistible revolution?</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat do I have to do to prove to the church that I&rsquo;m not a fan?</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen is it good enough? When is it, simply, enough?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd who is taking care of all that God has entrusted to me while I&rsquo;m off on some search for significance by being a crazy irresistible radical?</p>\n<p>\n\tI wonder this. Do you wonder this? Or has the desperate attempt to keep up with the new Jones&rsquo;s suffocated you with the fear of failure? Or have they (these crazy, irresistible radicals) convinced you that you&rsquo;re not really saved or you&rsquo;d be proving it&hellip;so prove it!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tI had a fight with my small family last week. It was a doozie and all of us were in on it. At the end of it I felt that nothing I did mattered - to anyone. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t sleep. I didn&rsquo;t pray. I fumed. I plotted. I drafted speeches in my head. But in the wee hours of the morning I heard the voice of God. I heard Him say, &ldquo;This is your reward&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tThis.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tThis. Is. Your. Reward.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I understood that we don&rsquo;t have to make God see. He sees. He sees every struggle that comes from a heart that is desperate to get it right&hellip; just&hellip; one&hellip; time. (Please, Lord!) He hears every word formed on our tongue that we <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> say. He knows we desperately long for a world where it&rsquo;s OK to give a homeless man a ride &ndash; or where there are no homeless men. He feels every beat of our heart when it is turned toward someone else&rsquo;s pain. And He is pleased for us to understand that even the neighbors&#39; goats are important. He sees all this because these were the appointments He planned for our days. He was watching to see what we would do, how we would respond, what we would learn, and how each of those things brought us back to Him. Because this is all about Him. His plan. His appointments. His ways of being crazyily, irresistibly radical.</p>\n<p>\n\tLive your life. Be faithful. Be kind. Be gentle. Be meek. Be humble. Bite your tongue. Obey. Win some. Lose some. Confess. Repent. Start again. Surrender. Struggle. Let go. Hang on. Lead. Follow. Just do life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t<strong>Just.<br />\n\tDo.<br />\n\tLife.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThere is nothing more radical than simple daily obedience and walking in &ldquo;the way&rdquo;. Leave the opportunities to God. And as 4 year old Nathan Parizek says, &ldquo;You know it was a good day if you didn&rsquo;t hit or bite anyone&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tGo. And as you go, don&rsquo;t hit and don&rsquo;t bite. Then teach someone else the secret to your success.</p>\n<p>\n\tBe blessed you crazy irresistible radical!!&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t(With all due respect to those whom <strong>God has called</strong> to do <strong>other </strong>crazy, irresistibly radical things which look different from our crazy, irresistibly radical things!)&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI was party to a discussion with a teacher in my church recently, an older, wise man who was trained at the Dallas Theological Seminary. We were discussing the Holy Spirit and how He works in us. Dr. Cupp&rsquo;s explanation revolutionized my thinking, but it was expectedly theological and heavy; the explanation necessarily long-winded. So of course I immediately began to work it over to find a more tangible, approachable, relevant (read: simple-minded) way to understand the principle. (You all do know by now that I am extremely simple-minded? I need it spoon fed with diagrams, please!! I also realize that my silly metaphorical way of understanding lacks theological depth. If depth&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for, slip over to Brady&rsquo;s or Brian&rsquo;s pages&hellip;or just keep listening to Pastor Armstrong.) Anyway&hellip;as I was chewing on this idea and trying to figure out how to get more of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s control in my life, it occurred to me that it will never happen to the degree that I desire because I am a hybrid.</p>\n<p>\n\tThink of the hybrid car. A hybrid vehicle has two motors. One motor is a typical internal combustion engine (we&rsquo;ll come back to that) and one motor is battery-run electric. When you start the vehicle, it uses the internal combustion engine. When you pick up speed, the vehicle switches to the electric battery engine. When you need more acceleration power, the vehicle uses both engines. In any case, the car is programmed to utilize the appropriate power source under specific conditions.</p>\n<p>\n\tGot all that? Pretty simple really. I can cut to the chase here and just tell you that the Holy Spirit is the only engine we need and we need Him full time under every condition &ndash; start, stop, power up, accelerate, coast &ndash; every condition. But you know and I know that we alternate back and forth between our own steam and His control. We are by nature a hybrid. And sadly, more often than not, we are internally combusting because we fail to access the power available to us (told you I&rsquo;d circle back around).</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery moment of the day we automatically shift into action when habit and experience are piqued, thereby operating under our own internal engine. Fight with the spouse? &ldquo;I got this!&rdquo; And the engine of the Holy Spirit powers down to let us operate on our own strength. Trip to the grocery? &ldquo;No problem&rdquo;. (*SNORT*) And off we go full throttle without His contribution. In order to have more of His power, we have to let up on our own. We power down so He can power up.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhich engine drives your day? Unfortunately, unlike the pre-programmed hybrid vehicle, we actually have to decide when to switch over to Holy Spirit power. It doesn&rsquo;t come automatically. And that, my friends, is why most of us (is that too much of an assumption?) operate under so little real power.</p>\n<p>\n\tI wish I could tell you that beyond having a grasp on the principle here that I have actually mastered the shift. I haven&rsquo;t. I live too much in my own head. I am far too used to my own ways. My habits are engrained. My decision-making reactive rather than reflective. I am a hybrid under the control of my own engine and burning a lot of gas. But I drive the hybrid anyway, hoping, always hoping, for better mileage from my day; shifting over and giving up control in quarters-of-miles. Maybe soon half-miles, and a bit further down the road whole-miles until finally, the Lord powers the whole trip. If you&rsquo;re managing to run on all-electric, kudos to you on your green footprint (wink). Those of us still in herky-jerky mode could use the occasional reminder to switch over when our engines run a little hot. Be patient as you power by us in the passing lane!<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

Christian&hellip;stop it. Immediately.</p>\n<p>\n\tGet your Bible handy. I mean it. This is serious business. Bring it up on blueletterbible.org or grab your desk top leather bound, and turn to 1 Corinthians 2. We&rsquo;re &lsquo;bout to come to Jesus. Go straight down to verse 9 and read it. Does it make you sigh? Does it strike some romantic chord within you? Does it heighten your emotions to think that God has some big surprise awaiting you? Well, snap out of it! (I&rsquo;m begging your grace with my tone throughout today. I tell you, if I see this verse out of context one more time, I&rsquo;m gonna have a moment.) Now go back and start reading in verse 6 through the end of the chapter. In fact, because I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re actually there with me now, here it is in the simplest paraphrase I know. (*NLT and words in bold for emphasis)</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Yet when I am among mature believers, I do speak with words of wisdom, but not the kind of wisdom that belongs to this world or to the rulers of this world, who are soon forgotten. 7 No, the wisdom we speak of is the mystery of God &mdash;his plan that was <strong>previously </strong>hidden, even though he made it for our ultimate glory before the world began. 8&nbsp; <strong>But the rulers of this world have not understood it; if they had, they would not have crucified our glorious Lord.9 That is what the Scriptures mean when they say,</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared<br />\n\tfor those who love him.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>10 <strong><u>But</u> it was <u>to us</u> that <u>God revealed these things</u> by his Spirit. For his Spirit searches out everything and shows us God&rsquo;s deep secrets. </strong>11 No one can know a person&rsquo;s thoughts except that person&rsquo;s own spirit, and no one can know God&rsquo;s thoughts except God&rsquo;s own Spirit. 12 <strong>And we have received God&rsquo;s Spirit (not the world&rsquo;s spirit), <u>so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us.</u></strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>13 When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit&rsquo;s words to explain spiritual truths. 14 But <strong>people who aren&rsquo;t spiritual can&rsquo;t receive these truths from God&rsquo;s Spirit.</strong> It all sounds foolish to them and they can&rsquo;t understand it, for <strong>only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means</strong>. 15 Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things, but they themselves cannot be evaluated by others. 16 For, &ldquo;Who can know the LORD&rsquo;s thoughts? Who knows enough to teach him?&rdquo; But <strong><u>we</u> understand these things, for <u>we </u>have the mind of Christ.</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tNow, reason with me if you will. (Taking a deep breath here&hellip;letting it out slowly.) Just by reading the words I emphasized (and if there was a &ldquo;shout&rdquo; option, I would have added it too!) do you see anything that might cause you to interpret verse 9 differently from the way it&rsquo;s typically used as a stand alone thought? Is it really good news to you that you <em><strong>can&rsquo;t </strong></em>know what God has planned for you?? Is that good news to anyone? Would that entice someone lost in the world&rsquo;s darkness to turn to the light and say, &ldquo;Now, <em><strong>that&rsquo;s</strong></em> some good news!&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me help you. What Paul is essentially telling the Corinthians is, put simply, that it is unbelievers who can not know what God has planned for those (of us) who love Him. Because of their ignorance, they crucified Christ! <u><em><strong>But</strong></em></u> (did I emphasize that enough?) <u><em><strong>we have the mind of Christ and the Spirit of Truth so that we can know all the wonderful things God has freely given us.</strong></em></u> Why on earth would He not want us to know all the good things He has freely given and has planned for us?</p>\n<p>\n\tChristian, do you see it? Do you see the lie Satan is spreading throughout the world every time you use this verse out of context as if it is good news &ndash; posting it to your Facebook page and pinning it to your Pinterest board? The lie says that God is secretive. God is not forthcoming. God is unknowable &ndash; far off. God withholds from His own children what is good and hopeful. Do you see the damage Satan is doing to God&rsquo;s reputation? Do you see the damage he&rsquo;s doing to yours? Perhaps an unbeliever would not understand the spiritual truths being unveiled here, but they can certainly read with intelligence, and if they took the time, would see what is plainly spelled out in scripture. <em><strong>Our</strong></em> scripture. The Word to which we have entrusted our eternal souls! And yet we use it as if we are ignorant of its message. Are we? Shame on us. No wonder the world mocks. They should.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlrighty. That&rsquo;s enough finger wagging, I promise. I pray, however, that that particular bite of cherry pie just fell in your lap and stained your shirt on the way down. I pray that conviction moves you stand up under its weight and run&hellip;run&hellip;to the Word and embrace it as if your life and eternity depend on it. I pray that you might become a workman approved to rightly handle and hold out the Word of life to a generation that is perishing in unbelief. You won&rsquo;t always get it right, none of us do, but we can certainly be without the kind of error that would be obvious to anyone with time, inclination, and two seeing eyes. Let&rsquo;s endeavor to stop cherry-picking. Make it so, dear Lord.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, let&rsquo;s talk about Jeremiah 29:11&hellip;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t(* In the newest translation of the New International Version this passage is handled with clarity, not breaking the grammatical train of thought&nbsp; between verses 9 and 10. If you pulled up blueletterbible&rsquo;s version of the NIV you read it as it is newly translated. Most of us, however, are still carrying around our 1984 translations which have the unfortunate break in thought. Please, if nothing else, memorize this passage in its new, better, more accurate phrasing and repeat it as GOOD NEWS!)</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tRob Bell has been a controversial figure in Christian circles for quite some time.&nbsp; His most recent book, <em>Love Wins</em>, in particular, touched off heated discussions among Christians about heaven and hell.&nbsp; In the book, Bell effectively says that God does not send people to hell, Biblical hell doesn&rsquo;t exist, and that one does not need Jesus to be saved.&nbsp; As a result, we thought it would be helpful to warn our brothers and sisters in Christ about this false teacher.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tBell is a man who rejects much of the fundamental beliefs that define a person as a Christian, and this is what makes him a false teacher.&nbsp; As Jesus warned us, \"<em>15 &ldquo;Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16 You will know them by their fruits</em>.\" (Matthew 7)&nbsp; Bell&rsquo;s &ldquo;fruits&rdquo; are his false teachings.&nbsp; Furthermore, we read in 1 Timothy 6, \"<em>3 If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine conforming to godliness, 4 he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions, 5 and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain</em>.\"&nbsp; Bell contradicts several of Jesus&#39; teachings, which we consider below.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tIn his book, <em>Sex God</em>, Bell says, &ldquo;To the Jewish mind, heaven is not a fixed, unchanging geographical location somewhere other than this world. Heaven is the realm where things are as God intends them to be. . . . Now if there&rsquo;s a realm where things are as God wants them to be, then there must be a realm where things are not as God wants them to be. Where things aren&rsquo;t according to God&rsquo;s will. Where people aren&rsquo;t treated as fully human. It&rsquo;s called hell.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tScripture does not view hell this way at all.&nbsp; This world will be gone one day (2 Peter 3:7).&nbsp; Hell is a literal place, and Jesus spoke more often about hell than other subjects (Revelation 20:14-15).&nbsp; This is a direct contradiction of Scripture, which makes Bell a false teacher as described above.&nbsp; Furthermore, Bell demonstrates a superficial knowledge of God.&nbsp; There is no realm where things are not as God wants them to be.&nbsp; Even though this world is full of sin, it is all according to God&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; God is not the author of sin, yet Scripture makes clear that the Fall, Jesus&rsquo; atoning sacrifice on the cross, His resurrection and our justification and sanctification are all part of God&rsquo;s plan.&nbsp; Ephesians 1 says God chose believers in Christ before the foundation of the world, and predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself.&nbsp; We learn through God&rsquo;s word that God is a sovereign God, and nothing is able to happen anywhere apart from His will.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tBell effectively teaches universalism, although he is careful not to be explicit about it.&nbsp; In <em>Jesus Wants to Save Christians</em>, he says, \"Jesus is the representative of the entire human family. His blood covers the entire created door. Jesus is saving everyone and everything.\"&nbsp; In an interview, in response to the question do you believe in a literal hell that is defined simply as eternal separation from God, he said, \"Well, there are people now who are seriously separated from God. So I would assume that God will leave room for people to say &lsquo;no I don&rsquo;t want any part of this.&rsquo; My question would be, does grace win or is the human heart stronger than God&rsquo;s love or grace. Who wins, does darkness and sin and hardness of heart win or does God&rsquo;s love and grace win?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThis teaching denies the Bible&#39;s explicit teaching that God will save some people, but not all.&nbsp; It also denies that Christianity is the only way to salvation.&nbsp; John 3:18 makes clear that if one does not believe in Jesus he is condemned already.&nbsp; John 14:6 makes clear that one is saved solely by faith in Christ.&nbsp; Again, Bell&#39;s teaching is shown to be false.&nbsp; Note that this is not merely incorrect interpretation of Scripture.&nbsp; This is much, much more serious.&nbsp; This type of teaching denies the true gospel, and this makes Bell a heretic.&nbsp; This may sound harsh, but read Galatians, where Paul says that anyone who preaches &ldquo;another gospel&rdquo; is to be accursed (Galatians 1:8-9).</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tBell effectively denies the gospel.&nbsp; In his <em>Love Wins</em> promotional video, Bell says, \"And then there is the question behind the questions, the real question:&nbsp; What is God like?&nbsp; Because millions and millions of people were taught that the primary message&mdash;the center of the Gospel of Jesus&mdash;is that God is going to send you to hell, unless you believe in Jesus.&nbsp; And so, what gets, subtly, sort of caught and taught is that Jesus rescues you from God.&nbsp; But what kind of God is that; that we would need to be rescued from this God?&nbsp; How could that God ever be good; how could that God ever be trusted?&nbsp; And how could that ever be good news.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThis is blasphemy.&nbsp; Scripture makes clear that if you do not believe in Jesus, you will go to hell.&nbsp; Jesus explicitly stated in John 8:24, \"<em>Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins</em>.\"&nbsp; If one dies in sin, one will not be written in the Book of Life, and will be cast into the lake of fire (see Rev. 20 above).&nbsp; Furthermore, Jesus does not rescue us from God, but He does rescue us from God&#39;s just and righteous wrath:&nbsp; \"<em>Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him</em>.\" (Romans 5:9)&nbsp; That is why the gospel is good news, we are sinners saved by Jesus&#39; atoning sacrifice on the cross and given His perfect righteousness.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tBell teaches that people will have a second chance to believe after death.&nbsp; In <em>Love Wins</em>, he states, \"[There will be] endless opportunities in an endless amount of time for people to say yes to God.&nbsp; At the heart of this perspective is the belief that, given enough time, everybody will turn to God and find themselves in the joy and peace of God&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; The love of God will melt every hard heart, and even the most &lsquo;depraved sinners&rsquo; will eventually give up their resistance and turn to God.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAgain, this directly contradicts Scripture.&nbsp; Hebrews 9:27 says, \"<em>And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment.</em>\"</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tBell affirms homosexuality.&nbsp; In a Christian Post article on Bell, he says, \"I believe God [is] pulling us ahead into greater and greater affirmation and acceptance of our gay brothers and sisters and pastors and friends and neighbors and coworkers.\"&nbsp; And then, \"I am for fidelity.&nbsp; I am for love, whether it&#39;s a man and a woman, a woman and a woman, a man and a man.&nbsp; I think the ship has sailed and I think that the church needs to just &hellip; this is the world that we are living in and we need to affirm people wherever they are.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAgain, this is clearly un-Biblical.&nbsp; Bell obviously does not understand that marriage is a picture of our union with Christ, and to pair men with men and women with women is to pervert the symbol that God intended marriage to represent.&nbsp; By making these statements, Bell proves himself to be the person described in Romans 1:32 (speaking about, among other sins, homosexuality):&nbsp; \"<em>and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them</em>.\"&nbsp; In addition, Scripture makes clear that practicing homosexuals will not enter the kingdom of heaven:&nbsp; \"<em>9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God</em>.\" (1 Corinthians 6)&nbsp; Only Christians go to heaven.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAs you can see, Bell has very serious false teachings.&nbsp; Based on his rejection of God&#39;s very clear teaching in Scripture, I think it is plain that Bell is not a Christian.&nbsp; He fits the false teacher warning that Jesus gives us.&nbsp; Not only that, if he was truly a believer, he would not reject what God clearly teaches, as I have demonstrated above.&nbsp; Jesus said, \"<em>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber. 2 But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep. 3 To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 4 When he puts forth all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. 5 A stranger they simply will not follow, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers</em>.\" (John 10:1-5)&nbsp; Jesus&#39; voice is Scripture, and that is whom we should follow.&nbsp; Bell&#39;s voice is a stranger, and believers should not follow him, since his voice leads us away from the truth.</p>"

(Ephesians 2).&nbsp; Therefore, Sola Gratia brings glory to God alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSimilar to Sola Gratia is Sola Fide, that we are saved by faith alone in Christ alone, and this brings God glory.&nbsp; All the false religions either say we are saved by works, or by faith plus works, as we saw the Catholic church teaches.&nbsp; If there is even one small contribution we make to our salvation, then we have something about which to boast.&nbsp; Sadly, even today, most Christians believe that we have the &ldquo;free will&rdquo; to accept or reject faith in Christ, a belief that is the polar opposite of what Scripture teaches.&nbsp; Christians have told me that even though faith is a gift, we still must choose to receive it or reject it.&nbsp; They say this without thinking through the logical conclusion of the statement.&nbsp; If I chose to believe the same gospel that my friend rejected, then there MUST have been something in me that was better than my friend that caused me to believe.&nbsp; I was either smarter, humbler (which, in this case would be quite ironic!), or something that my friend was not, which means I now have something about which I can boast.&nbsp; Again, Scripture makes clear that apart from God&rsquo;s grace and faith, we are spiritually dead.&nbsp; Spiritually speaking, dead men can do nothing apart from God.&nbsp; Ephesians 2 says we were dead, but God made us alive in Christ; not man, God alone.&nbsp; Therefore, Sola Fide brings glory to God alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThat Christ alone propitiates the wrath of God, and that Christ alone is our righteousness brings glory to God.&nbsp; Our sin separates us from God, and God has provided one, and only one, mediator to reconcile us to Him.&nbsp; Yet, sinful men, always seeking to rob God of His glory, devised other ways to be reconciled.&nbsp; Catholicism adds penance to Christ&rsquo;s once for all, fully sufficient atonement.&nbsp; Islam says if our good works outweigh our bad, we go to heaven.&nbsp; False religions always seek to direct us away from Christ.&nbsp; Similarly, Scripture requires us to be righteous, and our righteousness is found in Christ&rsquo;s obedience alone.&nbsp; But again, false religions teach that <em>our</em> good works make us righteous.&nbsp; If anything we do adds to our salvation, then we rob God of the glory that is due to Him alone.&nbsp; Scripture teaches that Christ&rsquo;s one time sacrifice is sufficient for all of our sins (Hebrews 7:27), and that we are made righteous by Christ&rsquo;s obedience (Romans 5:19).&nbsp; Therefore, Solus Christus brings glory to God alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNearly three thousand years ago, God declared beforehand what He would do to reconcile His children to Himself through the person and work of His Son, Messiah Yeshua.&nbsp; He declared this well in advance, so that what occurred would be attributable to Him alone, and therefore He would receive the honor, distinction and glory that is due Him.&nbsp; Isaiah 42 says,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;<em>5 Thus says God the Lord,<br />\n\tWho created the heavens and stretched them out,<br />\n\tWho spread out the earth and its offspring,<br />\n\tWho gives breath to the people on it<br />\n\tAnd spirit to those who walk in it,<br />\n\t6 &ldquo;I am the Lord, I have called You in righteousness,<br />\n\tI will also hold You by the hand and watch over You,<br />\n\tAnd I will appoint You as a covenant to the people,<br />\n\tAs a light to the nations,<br />\n\t7 To open blind eyes,<br />\n\tTo bring out prisoners from the dungeon<br />\n\tAnd those who dwell in darkness from the prison.<br />\n\t8 &ldquo;I am the Lord, that is My name;<br />\n\tI will not give My glory to another,<br />\n\tNor My praise to graven images.<br />\n\t9 &ldquo;Behold, the former things have come to pass,<br />\n\tNow I declare new things;<br />\n\tBefore they spring forth I proclaim them to you</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe five solas of the Reformation give us a helpful way to remember what God, and God alone, has done for us in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; All we can do is rejoice and give Him thanks and praise, glory and honor, since He alone has accomplished our salvation.&nbsp; Like the apostle Paul, we proclaim, &ldquo;<em>33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!&nbsp; How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!&nbsp; 34 For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who became His counselor?&nbsp; 35 Or who has first given to Him that it might be paid back to him again?&nbsp; 36 For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.&nbsp; To Him be the glory forever. Amen</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSOLI DEO GLORIA!</p>"

There is just something so&hellip;mesmerizing&hellip;about seeing people raw. No pretense. Stripped of anything that resembles humanity. Puking their guts up. Frozen in fear 20 feet in the air. Dazed and confused. Asleep on their feet. Last night, during the Green Beret program, one poor trainee just lost it. Completely lost it. (Warning: the following material may be offensive to some readers!) During the two hour rolling test, where the trainees literally roll themselves like Tootsie Rolls back and forth over the training pad, this trainee (let&rsquo;s call him #157) lost his tootsies. Now the rule is that you have to get out of the path of the other trainees if you&rsquo;re going to toss them, but I&rsquo;m afraid he didn&rsquo;t make it quite that far. As the cadre yelled at him, he attempted to bury the evidence, carefully patting it down into the dust as if no one would notice the squish when they rolled over it. The instructor asked him, &ldquo;Maybe it would be better if you put it in your pocket?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, yes sir.&rdquo; was his reply as he began collecting the pile. So. That&rsquo;s just wrong. On so many levels. And his instructor knew it. A medic was called.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow here&rsquo;s where it gets good. As the medic was leading trainee #157 from the training pad, he asked the dazed young man, &ldquo;Do you know where you are?&rdquo; Trainee #157 replied, &ldquo;Uh&hellip;hash browns?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;ll give you a minute.</p>\n<p>\n\tI needed about 5, myself.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact&hellip;I&rsquo;m still laughing. Just laughing! That. Is. So. Funny. &ldquo;Hash browns?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, here&rsquo;s the thing. As my husband pointed out, the poor kid probably went in his mind to his last &ldquo;happy place&rdquo;, and there was a plate of hash browns. &ldquo;Where are you, soldier?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mmm-mmm&hellip;I&rsquo;m in Hash Brown City.&rdquo; (OK&hellip;still laughing!)</p>\n<p>\n\tI bet you&rsquo;re thinking that I can&rsquo;t wrestle a lesson out of this one and all the previous paragraphs were a gratuitous attempt to draw you into my twisted sense of humor over the human condition. Well, you would be wrong! There are lessons everywhere we look if we only have eyes to see (much to my son&rsquo;s eternal dismay). Simply put: where are you? Are you in the middle of a tough time? Is there a lot of yelling there? Is your world spinning? Are you being tossed back and forth? Have you been stripped of everything that resembles normal and left raw? Have you been rolling in muck? Is the darkness closing in? Have you surrendered to the madness?</p>\n<p>\n\tGo back to your happy place. Jesus is there. And He&rsquo;s got hash browns.</p>\n<p>\n\t(In defense of self, lest you think me completely ridiculous, please consider the following passages if you need a bread crumb trail to follow back to the Lord.<br />\n\tDeuteronomy 11:18, Joshua 3 and 4, Psalm 139, Proverbs 3:5-6, Matthew 14, Luke 9, John 6:35, John 8:12, 2 Corinthians 12:9, Revelation 22:17&hellip;)&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tLast night my husband and I watched a program about becoming an Army Ranger. It was amazing! I&rsquo;m so grateful to those men and women who stand on the wall for all of us, and equally grateful that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be me! I&rsquo;d be out the first time I had to climb more than 6 feet off the ground. &ldquo;Do you want to quit, soldier?!&rdquo; &ldquo;Uh, sir, yes sir!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s me.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the things a Ranger has to learn is to rely on their buddy. All for one and one for all&hellip;and all that. That must be the hardest part for these brave, self-sufficient and independent soldiers. It is so humbling to accept that you are not able to accomplish your task alone, and that as much as someone is relying on you, you also must rely on them. One of the &ldquo;tests&rdquo; these Army Rangers have to pass is based on this truth. From the top of a small cliff, they must rappel down the side, <em><strong>without touching the rope</strong></em>, while their buddy at the bottom belays them safely to the ground. They have their feet against the rock, legs pushed out straight, arms flung out to the sides and they literally lay back into thin air. Now that&rsquo;s some kind of faith. And some of them can not do it. Can. Not. Do it. Every instinct in them tells them to grab the rope. But until they pass this test, they can not become a Ranger.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s a long story, but I&rsquo;ve been suffering the stress of a broken family relationship that is the result of accumulated misunderstanding, hurt feelings, and unmitigated pride on both sides. This week I had had enough and made &ndash; and badly botched &ndash; an attempt to reconcile. I can honestly say that my motives in the moment were pure, my intentions were good and my hope was surrendered to God. But my approach was bad, and maybe my heart was (is?) still not fully broken over the rift. Facts I did not see in the moment, but only on the heels of doing further damage. In other words&hellip;I grabbed the rope&hellip;and as I hurtled to the ground I suffered a painful case of rope burn.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;m still trying to figure out why God let&rsquo;s us fall like that sometimes. Oh, I know there&rsquo;s always a lesson to be learned and I can scrape one out of this mess too, but that doesn&rsquo;t undo the damage I did. And the truly frustrating and confusing part to me is that I was prayerful throughout. I was careful with my words (I thought) and I was obedient (I thought) to a ministry of reconciliation. But God gave me <em><strong>hind</strong></em>sight that allowed me to see through the other person&rsquo;s eyes&hellip;and it wasn&rsquo;t pretty. Because they couldn&rsquo;t see my heart. Or maybe they could and that was the problem. Anyway&hellip;I think ultimately what happened was that I lost faith that God &ldquo;had&rdquo; this problem and I decided it was time for me to do something rather than lay back and let Him lower me to the ground. And I paid for it. &ldquo;<em>There is a way that seems right to a man but in the end it leads to death.</em>&rdquo; (Proverbs 14:12)</p>\n<p>\n\tYou know, God doesn&rsquo;t really need our help. At the end of the day, the truth is, what I just couldn&rsquo;t stand any longer was the feeling of helplessness. It was so uncomfortable that I grabbed the rope and tried to do this thing myself! (Didn&rsquo;t I just write something about being uncomfortable&hellip;and that being a GOOD thing?!) I just wanted to end it. I thought it was my responsibility to make things right. But maybe God was working it out in His way, in His time and all I had to do was push off and fling out my arms. But I grabbed the dad-gum rope. In Ranger speak, that would be a &ldquo;no-go&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, here I am with wounded hands, smarting from a collision between the earth and my fanny, knowing that I likely can&rsquo;t undo the damage I&rsquo;ve done to an already expiring relationship and I find myself at the top of the cliff&hellip;again. Trusting God to work a miracle. Understanding that He&hellip;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tDOES<br />\n\tNOT<br />\n\tNEED<br />\n\tMY<br />\n\tHELP&hellip;</p>\n<p>\n\t...and yet, I still might grab the rope. But I hope not. &lsquo;Cause there are consequences. And they&rsquo;re painful. More painful than the temporary discomfort I&rsquo;m enduring hanging here in mid-air, suspended by nothing but this red cord and my belaying buddy. If you&rsquo;re here on the cliff-face with me, hear this (and remind me often!!)&hellip;<em><strong>Don&rsquo;t touch the rope! </strong></em>Let go. Lay back. Trust God. And walk down the wall. Blind. Fearful. Vulnerable. Just walk down the wall. He&rsquo;s got this thing.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

Therefore, if anyone says that blessed Peter the apostle was not appointed by Christ the lord as prince of all the apostles and visible head of the whole church militant; or that it was a primacy of honour only and not one of true and proper jurisdiction that he directly and immediately received from our lord Jesus Christ himself:&nbsp; let him be anathema&hellip;. Therefore, if anyone says that it is not by the institution of Christ the lord himself (that is to say, by divine law) that blessed Peter should have perpetual successors in the primacy over the whole church; or that the Roman pontiff is not the successor of blessed Peter in this primacy:&nbsp; let him be anathema.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThey justify this by Jesus&rsquo; statement to Peter that He gave him the keys to the kingdom to bind on earth and in heaven (Matthew 16:19).&nbsp; However, Jesus makes this same statement to His disciples in Matthew 18:18, thus nullifying any kind of papal primacy for Peter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe First Vatican Council also taught that the pope has supreme power over the whole church:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;So, then, if anyone says that the Roman pontiff has merely an office of supervision and guidance, and not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the whole church, and this not only in matters of faith and morals, but also in those which concern the discipline and government of the church dispersed throughout the whole world; or that he has only the principal part, but not the absolute fullness, of this supreme power; or that this power of his is not ordinary and immediate both over all and each of the churches and over all and each of the pastors and faithful:&nbsp; let him be anathema.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAlso at the First Vatican Council, the Catholic church formalized the doctrine of papal infallibility.&nbsp; Here is what they said:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;We teach and define as a divinely revealed dogma that when the Roman pontiff speaks EX CATHEDRA, that is, when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole church, he possesses, by the divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, that infallibility which the divine Redeemer willed his church to enjoy in defining doctrine concerning faith or morals.&nbsp; Therefore, such definitions of the Roman pontiff are of themselves, and not by the consent of the church, irreformable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tImportantly, this does not mean that everything the pope says is infallible.&nbsp; Generally speaking, it is limited to pronouncements spoken &ldquo;from the chair&rdquo; (ex cathedra), that is, from the authority that comes from being the pope.&nbsp; Furthermore, this is generally limited to teaching on faith or morals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAs we demonstrated in the Sola articles on our website, the papacy was clearly not infallible, as several pronouncements from the Council of Trent contradict Scripture.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tRome also teaches that if a person does not profess obedience to the pope he cannot be saved:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;In this way, by unity with the Roman pontiff in communion and in profession of the same faith , the church of Christ becomes one flock under one supreme shepherd.&nbsp; This is the teaching of the catholic truth, and no one can depart from it without endangering his faith and salvation.&rdquo; (First Vatican Council)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;In the second place, we ask whether you and the Armenians obedient to you believe that no man of the wayfarers outside the faith of this Church, and outside the obedience to the Pope of Rome, can finally be saved.&rdquo; (Pope Clement VI, Super Quibusdam, 1351)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;It is an absolute necessity to submit to the Supreme Pastor, to whom it is absolutely necessary for salvation to remain subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Pope Leo XIII, Satis Cognitum, 1896)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;We declare, say, define, and pronounce that it is absolutely necessary for the salvation of every human creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Pope Boniface VIII, Unam Sanctum, 1302)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tMany Catholics I know disagree with several of these doctrines, especially infallibility, but that just makes them bad Catholics.&nbsp; Regardless of these doctrines, the important thing is to use this information to open up a conversation with your Catholic friends.&nbsp; Share with them the true gospel of Jesus Christ.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAt the time of the Reformation, the Catholic church had so corrupted the gospel that many man made requirements were necessary for one to be saved.&nbsp; Conveniently, a person needed the church for most of these requirements.&nbsp; For example, in addition to faith in Christ (see our previous article on Sola Fide <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/S=c09b5297ebc6e6ecd3b40a655ed4d20d2cdff7ac/resource_library/articles/sola_fide/\">here</a>), the Catholic church taught that the sacraments were necessary for salvation.&nbsp; Of course, only the church could administer the sacraments.&nbsp; The seven sacraments identified by Rome were baptism, confirmation, the eucharist, penance, extreme unction, order, and matrimony (not that one needed to be married to be saved).&nbsp; Indeed, even God&rsquo;s grace for salvation was believed to be imparted by the sacraments.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe Reformers rejected this, as we have seen in the previous Sola articles.&nbsp; As we said about Sola Fide, there is a large overlap with Solus Christus, for a person is saved by faith alone <em>in Christ alone</em>.&nbsp; Salvation is by faith alone apart from works, and it is also in Christ alone apart from works.&nbsp; The key question when it came to Christ alone was, &ldquo;Is Christ <em>sufficient</em> for our salvation, or must we add something to His work?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Catholic church said salvation was by Christ plus works, sacraments, etc.&nbsp; The Reformers said it was Christ alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t(As an aside, the Catholic church actually teaches that people can be saved <em>apart</em> from Christ, through works alone.&nbsp; This is taught in the Catholic Catechism:&nbsp; &ldquo;847 This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ and his Church:&nbsp; Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the interest of brevity, compare this to Romans 1 and 3 (people exchange the truth of God for a lie, worship the creature rather than the Creator, no one seeks God, there is none righteous, etc.).&nbsp; By this logic, you&rsquo;d be better off not preaching the gospel to remote jungle natives.&nbsp; If they reject the gospel they are damned; if they are ignorant, they have a chance.&nbsp; Such teaching is clearly un-Biblical.&nbsp; This is why it&rsquo;s important to always look to Scripture alone.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tMan&rsquo;s problem is that we are sinners, and are separated by sin from our Holy God.&nbsp; We cannot save ourselves; we need a Savior.&nbsp; Our savior needs to solve our problem on two levels.&nbsp; First, our sins must be punished, for God is a just God.&nbsp; Second, we must be perfect, just as our Father in heaven is perfect.&nbsp; How one believes this is accomplished determines whether a person has the true gospel or a false gospel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAlso as mentioned in the Sola Fide article, the Catholic church ironically accepts the teaching of original sin.&nbsp; This doctrine states that we are born sinners because of Adam&rsquo;s sin.&nbsp; Adam was our representative, so to speak, and part of God&rsquo;s curse was that all of Adam&rsquo;s progeny would be fallen, or spiritually dead, just as Adam died when he ate of the fruit.&nbsp; The Catholic church accepts that our sins were punished in Jesus when He sacrificed Himself on the cross (sort of; more on this below).&nbsp; The irony is that although they accept that Adam&rsquo;s sin was imputed, or credited, to all mankind, and that our sins were paid for by Christ, they strongly deny that Christ&rsquo;s righteousness is imputed to believers.&nbsp; Instead, the official teaching of the Catholic church is that one must become inherently righteous by his own deeds, although those deeds are done with God&rsquo;s help.&nbsp; They deny Christ&rsquo;s righteousness <em>alone</em> is sufficient for the believer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAt the other end of the spectrum, Martin Luther had this to say about Christ and His righteousness:&nbsp; &ldquo;When God&#39;s righteousness is mentioned in the gospel, it is God&#39;s action of declaring righteous the unrighteous sinner who has faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The righteousness by which a person is justified (declared righteous) is not his own but that of another, Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a large part of the disagreement between Luther and the Catholic church, and was at the heart of the Reformation.&nbsp; This question remains incredibly important today.&nbsp; Who is right?&nbsp; We look to Scripture alone for the answer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tBefore we do that, however, it&rsquo;s useful to consider some of the Catholic church&rsquo;s teachings on forgiveness of sins.&nbsp; Although they believe Christ paid the price for our sins, they do not accept that He paid the price for sins committed after baptism.&nbsp; For those sins, other means of forgiveness are necessary.&nbsp; We read this from the &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; Council of Trent, fourteenth session:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;If such, in all the regenerate, were their gratitude towards God, as that they constantly preserved the justice received in baptism by His bounty and grace; there would not have been need for another sacrament, besides that of baptism itself, to be instituted for the remission of sins.&nbsp; But because God, rich in mercy, knows our frame, He hath bestowed a remedy of life even on those who may, after baptism, have delivered themselves up to the servitude of sin and the power of the devil, --the sacrament to wit of Penance, by which the benefit of the death of Christ is applied to those who have fallen after baptism&hellip;. The Lord also said; Except you do penance, you shall also likewise perish; and Peter, the prince of the apostles, recommending penitence to sinners who were about to be initiated by baptism, said; Do penance, and be baptized every one you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tRecall that the word penance is not in the original Greek of the New Testament.&nbsp; Rather, the word repent was mistranslated by Jerome into Latin in the Latin Vulgate Bible.&nbsp; Indeed, compare Luke 13:3 from the 1582 Catholic Douay-Rheims Bible (translated from the Latin Vulgate) to the newer (corrected), Catholic New American Bible:&nbsp; DR &ndash; &ldquo;<em>No, I say to you: but unless you shall do penance, you shall all likewise perish</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; NAB &ndash; &ldquo;<em>By no means!&nbsp; But I tell you, if you do not repent, you will all perish as they did</em>!&rdquo;&nbsp; So much for infallibility.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tFrom the (also &ldquo;infallible&rdquo;) Catholic catechism (produced in 1994):&nbsp; &ldquo;1493 One who desires to obtain reconciliation with God and with the Church, must confess to a priest all the unconfessed grave sins he remembers after having carefully examined his conscience. The confession of venial faults, without being necessary in itself, is nevertheless strongly recommended by the Church.&nbsp; 1494 The confessor proposes the performance of certain acts of \"satisfaction\" or \"penance\" to be performed by the penitent in order to repair the harm caused by sin and to re-establish habits befitting a disciple of Christ.&nbsp; 1495 <strong>Only priests who have received the faculty of absolving from the authority of the Church can forgive sins in the name of Christ</strong>.&rdquo; (my emphasis added)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe Mass (or the Eucharist) is also considered necessary for the forgiveness of sins committed after baptism.&nbsp; Again, the Council of Trent:&nbsp; &ldquo;And forasmuch as, in this divine sacrifice which is celebrated in the mass, that same Christ is contained and immolated in an unbloody manner [the wafer and the wine], who once offered Himself in a bloody manner on the altar of the cross; the holy Synod teaches, <strong>that this sacrifice is truly propitiatory and that by means thereof this is effected, that we obtain mercy,</strong> and find grace in seasonable aid, if we draw nigh unto God, contrite and penitent, with a sincere heart and upright faith, with fear and reverence.&nbsp; For the Lord, appeased by the oblation thereof, and granting the grace and gift of penitence, forgives even heinous crimes and sins.&nbsp; <strong>For the victim is one and the same, the same now offering by the ministry of priests, who then offered Himself on the cross, the manner alone of offering being different</strong>.&rdquo; (my emphasis added)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWith respect to becoming inherently righteous, the Catholic church teaches that this is a process, whereby our good works make us righteous over time.&nbsp; They teach that by Jesus infusing His virtue into believers, good works proceed from this, and we thereby make ourselves truly righteous.&nbsp; Here is what Trent teaches:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XI.-If any one saith, that men are justified, <strong>either by the sole imputation of the justice of Christ</strong>, or by the sole remission of sins, <strong>to the exclusion of the grace and the charity which is poured forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inherent in them; or even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the favour of God</strong>; let him be anathema. (my emphasis added)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XII.-If any one saith, that justifying faith is nothing else but confidence in the divine mercy which remits sins for Christ&#39;s sake; or, that this confidence alone is that whereby we are justified; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XX.-If any one saith, that the man who is justified and how perfect soever, is not bound to observe the commandments of God and of the Church, but only to believe; as if indeed the Gospel were a bare and absolute promise of eternal life, <strong>without the condition of observing the commandments</strong>; let him be anathema. (my emphasis added)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XXIV.-If any one saith, that the <strong>justice received is not preserved and also increased before God through good works</strong>; but that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of Justification obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof; let him be anathema. (my emphasis added)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XXVI.-If any one saith, that the just ought not, for their good works done in God, to expect and hope for an eternal recompense from God, through His mercy and the merit of Jesus Christ, <strong>if so be that they persevere to the end in well doing and in keeping the divine commandments</strong>; let him be anathema. (my emphasis added)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XXX.-If any one saith, that, after the grace of Justification has been received, to every penitent sinner the guilt is remitted, and the debt of eternal punishment is blotted out in such wise, that there remains not any debt of temporal punishment to be discharged either in this world, or in the next in Purgatory, before the entrance to the kingdom of heaven can be opened (to him); let him be anathema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XXXII.-If any one saith, that the good works of one that is justified are in such manner the gifts of God, as that they are not also the good merits of him that is justified; or, that the said justified, <strong>by the good works which he performs through the grace of God</strong> and the merit of Jesus Christ, whose living member he is, <strong>does not truly merit increase of grace, eternal life, and the attainment of that eternal life</strong>,-if so be, however, that he depart in grace,-and also an increase of glory; let him be anathema. (my emphasis added)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAgainst the backdrop of this teaching, we now look to Scripture to see whether the Catholic church is correct, or if the Reformers were correct.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tFirst and foremost, if you are a believer in Christ, your understanding of what He accomplished on the cross is absolutely crucial.&nbsp; Did He merely wipe your slate clean after you were baptized, but now you must be absolutely perfect the rest of your life?&nbsp; If you do sin (and we all do), do you need to do penance, the Mass, etc. to be saved?&nbsp; If your answer to these questions is yes, then the gospel is no longer good news.&nbsp; Rather, it&rsquo;s a curse, because you are now under the Law again, at least as far as the Catholic church is concerned.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThankfully, Scripture gives us true good news.&nbsp; When Christ died on the cross, He uttered these words:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit</em>.&rdquo; (John 19:30)&nbsp; The Greek word for finished is <em>teleo</em>, which means &ldquo;finished, accomplished, perform, execute, complete.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWhat did Jesus finish, or accomplish?&nbsp; He accomplished the justice demanded by a Holy God, namely that sins must be atoned for with blood.&nbsp; Before Jesus, the Jews had the sacrifices of the Law, the blood of bulls and goats, which could never atone for sin, and therefore had to be continually repeated.&nbsp; But now, Christ finishes the sacrifice God demands for the propitiation of sins.&nbsp; If we say that Christ has not fully and finally accomplished this by His death on the cross, then, logically, His sacrifice was not <em>sufficient</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tYet again, Scripture confirms that indeed His sacrifice was sufficient.&nbsp; Hebrews 10 makes this abundantly clear:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>11 Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; 12 <strong>but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God</strong>, 13 waiting from that time onward until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet. 14 <strong>For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified</strong>. 15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying, 16 &ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws upon their heart, And on their mind I will write them,&rdquo; He then says, 17 &ldquo;And their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; 18 Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin</em>.&rdquo; (my emphasis added)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tUnder the Law, the sacrifices never took away sin, nor were they intended to do so.&nbsp; Rather, they pointed to Christ, they were a shadow of the cross.&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice, however, was a once for all time sacrifice.&nbsp; If by His offering we are made perfect, how is it we must do penance?&nbsp; And why must Christ be continually sacrificed in the Mass if God says He will remember our sins no more?&nbsp; Indeed, the good news is that there is no longer any offering for sin!&nbsp; Christ alone was necessary to pay for our sins.&nbsp; If we add anything to this, we no longer have the true gospel (Galatians 1).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWith respect to Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice and the Catholic church, the Reformer John Calvin had this to say, &ldquo;But the whole religion of Popery tends to lead men to contrive for themselves innumerable methods of seeking salvation; and hence we infer, that it is full to overflowing with abominable sacrileges.&nbsp; More especially, this word of Christ condemns the abomination of the Mass.&nbsp; All the sacrifices of the Law must have ceased, for the salvation of men has been completed by the one sacrifice of the death of Christ.&nbsp; What right, then, have the Papists, or what plausible excuse can they assign for saying, that they are authorised to prepare a new sacrifice, to reconcile God to men?&nbsp; They reply that it is not a new sacrifice, but the very sacrifice which Christ offered.&nbsp; But this is easily refuted; for, in the first place, they have no command to offer it; and, secondly, Christ, having once accomplished, by a single oblation, all that was necessary to be done, declares, from the cross, that all is finished.&nbsp; They are worse than forgers, therefore, for they wickedly corrupt and falsify the testament sealed by the precious blood of the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSecond, what you believe about how you become righteous is just as crucial for Christians.&nbsp; Do we really need to become perfect by our own works?&nbsp; Or, does God impute Christ&rsquo;s righteousness (i.e., His perfect works) to us by faith?&nbsp; If the former is true, then again, this is not good news!&nbsp; If the latter is true, it is the best news ever.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIf the Catholic church is correct, our righteousness, Christ says, must surpass that of the Pharisees.&nbsp; More than that, we are to be perfect just as our Father in heaven is perfect (Matthew 5:20, 48).&nbsp; Just what does such behavior look like?&nbsp; Jesus tells us, &ldquo;<em>And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him</em>.&rdquo; (John 8:29)&nbsp; Do you <em>always</em> do the things that are pleasing to Him?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t, but thankfully, Christ did.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tScripture tells us that we are made righteous not by our own obedience to the commandments, as the Catholic church taught.&nbsp; Rather, Romans 5 says, &ldquo;<em>18 So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.&nbsp; 19 For as through the one man&rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beloved, this is truly good news.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tScripture confirms this elsewhere in multiple places:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>8 More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, 9 and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith, 10 that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death; 11 in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead</em>.&rdquo; (Philippians 3; my emphasis added)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>21 But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, 22 even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe</em>.&rdquo; (Romans 3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>30 But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, 31 so that, just as it is written, &ldquo;Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord</em>.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 1; note that God chooses who is saved, He takes the punishment for the sin of the elect, and He provides the righteousness He demands)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>1 You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?&nbsp; 2 This is the only thing I want to find out from you:&nbsp; did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?&nbsp; 3 Are you so foolish?&nbsp; Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?&nbsp; 4 Did you suffer so many things in vain&mdash;if indeed it was in vain?&nbsp; 5 So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?&nbsp; 6 Even so Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.&nbsp; 7 Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham.&nbsp; 8 The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, &ldquo;All the nations will be blessed in you.&rdquo;&nbsp; 9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.&nbsp; 10 For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, &ldquo;Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, to perform them.&rdquo;&nbsp; 11 Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, &ldquo;The righteous man shall live by faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; 12 However, the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, &ldquo;He who practices them shall live by them.&rdquo;&nbsp; 13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us&mdash;for it is written, &ldquo;Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree&rdquo;&mdash; 14 in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith</em>.&rdquo; (Galatians 3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>1 Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ</em>.&rdquo; (2 Peter 1; whose righteousness?&nbsp; Ours?&nbsp; No, Jesus&rsquo; righteousness)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>6 In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell securely; And this is His name by which He will be called, &lsquo;The Lord our righteousness</em>.&rdquo; (Jeremiah 23; notice that in this verse and the one right below that the Lord is righteousness and believers (&ldquo;she&rdquo;) are equated with the Lord and His righteousness; we have no righteousness of our own)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>16 In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell in safety; and this is the name by which she will be called: the Lord is our righteousness</em>.&rdquo; (Jeremiah 33)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 3 For what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&rdquo; 4 Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. 5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness&hellip;23 Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him, 24 but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 25 He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification</em>.&rdquo; (Romans 4)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSo, we see that Scripture agrees with the Reformers.&nbsp; Christ paid the penalty for our sins once and for all time.&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s righteousness is imputed, or credited, to the believer.&nbsp; Thus, Scripture says, &ldquo;<em>23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; 25 whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith.&nbsp; This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed; 26 for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus</em>.&rdquo; (Romans 3)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tGod is just in that He punishes sins, and He took the punishment Himself on the cross.&nbsp; He is the justifier in that it is He who gives faith to the believer, and credits Christ&rsquo;s righteousness to us as well.&nbsp; This is good news, the best news ever in the history of the world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tGod used the Reformers, men like Martin Luther and John Calvin, to restore the pure gospel to His church.&nbsp; The renaissance that resulted from the preaching of the true gospel transformed Europe, and created a sharp distinction between the man made religion of Catholicism and the good news of salvation that comes through faith alone in Jesus Christ alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tLike the Judaism that existed in Jesus&rsquo; day, men had perverted the pure Law that God had given the Jews.&nbsp; They heaped burdens upon everyone, in addition to God&rsquo;s Law.&nbsp; Similarly, over time, the Catholic church perverted the pure gospel of Jesus Christ, adding burden upon burden upon those who think they are doing what is necessary to be saved.&nbsp; What Jesus said to the burdened Jews is now also true for those shackled by the burdens of Catholicism:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>28 Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.&nbsp; 29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.&nbsp; 30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is light</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSoli Deo Gloria!</p>"

I&rsquo;ve been practicing telling myself that I am what He says I am in spite of the way I feel, or what I think. Have you been practicing too? Well, let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve learned since then. Maybe it will resonate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tYou may remember me saying that I&rsquo;ve been growing out my hair. (Men, don&rsquo;t tune me out here. This isn&rsquo;t a beauty blog! Have you seen my photo?!) Since I turned forty some years ago, my body has been inhabited by alien life forms unsatisfied with the current state of affairs. My hair, for example, has become grey (under that Nice-n-Easy114), curly, and terribly unruly. I often dry it out straight, but in spite of my best efforts, and those of my hairdresser, I have a receding hair line that is sprouting little wispy &ldquo;baby&rdquo; hairs that stick straight up. I mean straight up. When I walk it&rsquo;s especially comical because those hairs wave back and forth with the breeze, wandering from one side of my natural part to the other. No matter how I dry it &ndash; on one side of the part or the other &ndash; it makes no difference. What does happen, though, when I get the part slightly off natural, my head feels like a cat that&rsquo;s been rubbed backward. If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to part your hair differently than normal you know the discomfort. If you&rsquo;ve never tried it, try it right now. Yes. Reach up and rearrange your hair until you&rsquo;ve completely hidden your natural part. Can&rsquo;t stand it, can you? Takes everything in you not to shake your head until it falls back to the natural default, right? This is how it feels to believe Jesus instead of you. It&rsquo;s like living on the other side of the part.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what I&rsquo;ve learned is that this discomfort is a litmus test of sorts. Believing Jesus goes against everything natural in me and it takes concentrated effort not to shrug off my faith and go back to the natural state of affairs. When I&rsquo;m most uncomfortable, I&rsquo;m exactly where I should be. When I&rsquo;m carelessly comfortable, I&rsquo;m in trouble. When I&rsquo;m living on the other side of the part, it is necessary to be completely focused on the help and strength of Christ not to shake off the discomfort, but to stand in awareness of it and persevere in spite of it. In Christian speak you might call that &ldquo;surrendered&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a posture that pleases Christ. And it doesn&rsquo;t demonstrate personal weakness or helpless vulnerability, but rather, strength of faith. It is a willingness to live in a state of discomfort for His sake. Like having your hair perpetually parted on the other side.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnyway, I just thought I&rsquo;d mention all that so that you know you have a kindred spirit in your uneasiness. There is nothing natural about this Christian experience. We are confused if we think it should be easy. And who will save us from this wretched body of death&hellip;and this unnatural part in our hair&hellip;but Jesus, the Christ, for whose sake we endure all things. Comb it over, brother and sister, and press on!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIn this life, what would you say is the most important question a person could ask?&nbsp; Would it involve your health, long life, how to achieve financial security, or perhaps wisdom?&nbsp; Maybe it would involve relationships?&nbsp; Well, it turns out that this question was asked by a jailer about 2,000 years ago, and it is arguably the most important question anyone could ever ask:&nbsp; &ldquo;What must I do to be saved?&rdquo; (Acts 16:30)&nbsp; Given that all people are sinners, we all deserve the wrath of God.&nbsp; The jailer obviously understood this fact, so he asks the most important question of all, how can a sinner be saved from the just wrath of a holy God?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tBy the time of the Reformation in the 1500s, the answer to this question had changed drastically from the time of Jesus, the apostles and the early church.&nbsp; Over time, the gospel (i.e., the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; of how one can be saved from God&rsquo;s wrath) became corrupted.&nbsp; This happened slowly, over a long period of time, although it started pretty early.&nbsp; Indeed, we even see this in Scripture, in Galatians, where the Judaizers were adding something to the gospel.&nbsp; Paul corrected this strongly, as we&rsquo;ll see below.&nbsp; As Paul showed the Galatians, and as Scripture makes abundantly clear, we are saved by faith alone in Christ alone.&nbsp; These two solas are inseparable, and there is a lot of overlap between the two, but for now, we&rsquo;ll focus on faith alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIt&rsquo;s useful to consider how the church moved away from this Scriptural doctrine.&nbsp; One of the first departures from this doctrine we see in the early church relates to the teaching that baptism is necessary for salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp; This teaching was found in the un-Biblical letter <em>The Shepherd of Hermas</em>.&nbsp; This letter was read in many early churches and was initially considered Scripture (and later rejected, for very good reason).&nbsp; This false letter concerns a vision Hermas was experiencing, seeing a tower that was explained to be the church.&nbsp; He is then told, &ldquo;Hear then why the tower is builded upon waters; it is because your life is saved and shall be saved by water.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other early church fathers added to this false teaching, Cyprian being a major one.&nbsp; In fact, many early church fathers taught this false doctrine, including the esteemed Augustine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tFrom baptism, other items were added as requirements for salvation.&nbsp; Since they falsely taught that baptism was necessary for salvation, their theology had a problem with sins committed after baptism.&nbsp; For example, during severe persecutions, many Christians caved during torture and denied Christ so they could spare their life (remember Peter, anyone?).&nbsp; This &ldquo;problem&rdquo; led to Cyprian teaching that for a person who denied Christ under persecution to be saved, salvation for that person could only come through martyrdom.&nbsp; This is clearly un-Biblical.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tOne of the reasons the early church went so far off track was due in part to some bad translations in a widely used version of the Bible.&nbsp; In the late 4th century, Jerome was commissioned by Pope Damasus to translate the Greek Septuagint into Latin.&nbsp; His work, the Latin Vulgate, became the most used Bible for about 1,000 years.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this translation had many errors, some of them extremely significant.&nbsp; Perhaps one of the most egregious errors was Jerome&rsquo;s mistranslation of the word for repent.&nbsp; The original Greek word is <em>metanoia</em>, which means to have a change of mind, with the view of turning from a life of sin and instead turning to God.&nbsp; However, rather than translate this as repentance, Jerome translated this into the Latin <em>poenitenitam agite</em>, which means, &ldquo;do acts of penance.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the teaching that one must feel sorry for one&rsquo;s sins committed after baptism, and in order to atone for them, one must do certain acts of penance, which the priest would give for the penitent sinner.&nbsp; (How the priest knew what the person should do is beyond me.&nbsp; Growing up as a Catholic, the priest would typically tell us to say so many Hail Marys and Our Fathers; how he knew which prayers to say and how many is obviously subjective, but such are the follies of man made religion.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAs a humorous aside, and a great example of how mistranslations can impact our beliefs, one of the other mistranslated words of the Vulgate was in Exodus 34:29.&nbsp;&nbsp; This passage correctly reads, &ldquo;<em>It came about when Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the testimony were in Moses&rsquo; hand as he was coming down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with Him.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp; The Hebrew word for &ldquo;shone&rdquo; is <em>qaran</em>, which means &ldquo;to shine, to send out rays&rdquo;, but can also mean, &ldquo;to display or grow horns.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jerome translated the passage so it read, &ldquo;his face was horned&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Obviously, context makes a difference in what definition is applied to the word used.&nbsp; The result?&nbsp; Google an image of Michelangelo&rsquo;s statue of Moses.&nbsp; It has horns growing out of his head!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSo, due in part to these mistranslations, in addition to acts of penance, other works were added for one to be saved.&nbsp; These included confession of sins to a priest, prayers, partaking of the Catholic mass, up to the point where only a priest could actually absolve peoples&rsquo; sins.&nbsp; Since no one died perfectly righteous, this led to the false doctrine of purgatory, where a person had to go after death to pay for unconfessed and unforgiven (by the priest) sins.&nbsp; This ultimately led to the practice of the granting of indulgences.&nbsp; This practice (which remains official Catholic teaching to this day) involved the granting by the church of the forgiveness of sins so that one&rsquo;s time in purgatory could be shortened.&nbsp; To obtain such forgiveness, one had to pay the church for such privilege.&nbsp; At the time of the Reformation, indulgences were being used to help finance the building of St. Peter&rsquo;s Basilica in Rome.&nbsp; One particular fundraiser, Johann Tetzel, used a particular phrase that would have made Madison Avenue proud:&nbsp; &ldquo;As soon as a coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in this environment that God used Martin Luther to start the Reformation, and return the church to the purity of the gospel.&nbsp; Part of this purity was to move the church away from works based salvation and return to the Biblical doctrine of justification by faith alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe doctrine of justification by faith alone really needs to be approached in at least two ways.&nbsp; First, we must consider God&rsquo;s sovereignty with respect to our salvation.&nbsp; Having a firm understanding of this helps us better understand why we can say that we are saved by faith <em>alone</em>.&nbsp; Second, we need to look at what Scripture explicitly says about this subject, which, thankfully, it says a lot.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tScripture makes clear that salvation is an act of God.&nbsp; As we saw in the article on Sola Gratia, apart from Christ, we are spiritually dead.&nbsp; In order for a person to believe in Christ to be saved, God the Holy Spirit must first regenerate that person.&nbsp; As Jesus stated, we must be born again, and this is an act of God, not of man.&nbsp; Jesus says we must be born of the Spirit (John 3:6), and Peter tells us that God has caused us to be born again (1 Peter 3).&nbsp; Once God has made us alive, we then have the ability and desire to believe in Christ and His glorious gospel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIn particular, in Ephesians 2, right after Paul tells us that we are spiritually dead, we read, &ldquo;<em>4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 6 and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; R.C. Sproul calls the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; perhaps the most important word in the Bible.&nbsp; If not for His mercy, we would be without hope.&nbsp; God is the one who made us alive with Christ, raised us up, seated us with Him in the heavenly places.&nbsp; He did all of this so He could show the surpassing riches of His grace, which we looked at in the previous article.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tPaul goes on to say, &ldquo;<em>8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We already talked about God&rsquo;s grace saving us, but we didn&rsquo;t talk about the <em>means</em> by which He saves.&nbsp; We read here that God accomplishes this <em>through faith</em>.&nbsp; Faith is also a gift of God, one that is given to us along with our regeneration.&nbsp; So, by grace, first God saves us and makes us spiritually alive.&nbsp; Once He makes us alive, He gives us the gift of faith.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNow, importantly, faith itself is not what saves us.&nbsp; Rather, faith always has an object.&nbsp; With respect to salvation, the object is Jesus.&nbsp; Therefore, it is through faith (the means by which we believe) in the Son of God by which we are saved.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe important point here is that it is God who not only is the source of our salvation, but also initiates it.&nbsp; He gives us spiritual life (regeneration) and faith so that we believe in Jesus as our Lord and Savior.&nbsp; This is not a gift He gives to everyone, but only to His elect, and all who receive this gift <em>will</em> believe in Jesus, because that is the very reason why God causes us to be born again and believe.&nbsp; How do we know?&nbsp; Scripture says, &ldquo;<em>So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; It will not return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it</em>.&rdquo; (Isaiah 55:11)&nbsp; The key point here is that because God is the author of salvation and it is totally dependent upon His work, then it can never be dependent upon our works.&nbsp; This leads to the second point, namely, what Scripture says about salvation by faith and works.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t(If you are interested in learning more about God&rsquo;s sovereignty and election, we have a helpful article <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/wrestling_with_god/\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIn response to Martin Luther&rsquo;s (and other Reformers&rsquo;) view that salvation was by faith alone, the Catholic church &ldquo;infallibly&rdquo; declared at the Council of Trent that faith was indeed necessary for salvation, but for a person to be saved he had to become inherently righteous.&nbsp; That is to say, a person must actually become perfect.&nbsp; This was done through good works.&nbsp; While the works were done by God&rsquo;s grace, they were truly <em>your</em> good works, by which a person became righteous.&nbsp; These are a few of the proclamations from the Council of Trent that demonstrate this &ldquo;official&rdquo; teaching of the Catholic church:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XI.-If any one saith, that men are justified, either by the sole imputation of the justice of Christ, or by the sole remission of sins, to the exclusion of the grace and the charity which is poured forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inherent in them; or even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the favour of God; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XII.-If any one saith, that justifying faith is nothing else but confidence in the divine mercy which remits sins for Christ&#39;s sake; or, that this confidence alone is that whereby we are justified; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XX.-If any one saith, that the man who is justified and how perfect soever, is not bound to observe the commandments of God and of the Church, but only to believe; as if indeed the Gospel were a bare and absolute promise of eternal life, without the condition of observing the commandments ; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XXIV.-If any one saith, that the justice received is not preserved and also increased before God through good works; but that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of Justification obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XXVI.-If any one saith, that the just ought not, for their good works done in God, to expect and hope for an eternal recompense from God, through His mercy and the merit of Jesus Christ, if so be that they persevere to the end in well doing and in keeping the divine commandments; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XXX.-If any one saith, that, after the grace of Justification has been received, to every penitent sinner the guilt is remitted, and the debt of eternal punishment is blotted out in such wise, that there remains not any debt of temporal punishment to be discharged either in this world, or in the next in Purgatory, before the entrance to the kingdom of heaven can be opened (to him); let him be anathema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tCANON XXXII.-If any one saith, that the good works of one that is justified are in such manner the gifts of God, as that they are not also the good merits of him that is justified; or, that the said justified, by the good works which he performs through the grace of God and the merit of Jesus Christ, whose living member he is, does not truly merit increase of grace, eternal life, and the attainment of that eternal life,-if so be, however, that he depart in grace,-and also an increase of glory; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAs you can plainly see, the Catholic church believes that works are necessary for salvation, and they reject salvation by faith alone in Christ alone.&nbsp; Keep in mind, these proclamations came from an official body of church bishops, and is therefore &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; according to Catholic doctrine.&nbsp; One can only decide if what they teach is truly infallible by comparing it to Scripture (this is why Sola Scriptura is one of the Solas; Scripture is always sovereign over man).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWhat we find is that Scripture makes clear that salvation is by faith and not by works.&nbsp; While there are many places in Scripture that we can look to see this, perhaps the best place to look is in Romans 3-5.&nbsp; Romans 3 makes clear that all have sinned and that there are none who are righteous.&nbsp; With this the Catholic church agrees.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tBut in Romans 4, Paul starts to make clear how it is that God makes a person righteous.&nbsp; He teaches us this, appropriately, with Abraham, for it was through Abraham that God would fulfill the New Covenant in Jesus.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;<em>What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found? 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 3 For what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&rdquo; 4 Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. 5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness, 6 just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:&nbsp; 7 &ldquo;Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, And whose sins have been covered.&nbsp; 8 &ldquo;Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNotice the sharp contrast Paul makes between faith and works.&nbsp; If a person can be justified (i.e., declared righteous) by works, he has something about which to boast.&nbsp; If one achieves righteousness by works, it is no longer a gift, it is a wage that is earned.&nbsp; On the other hand, those who believe in Him who justifies (i.e., Jesus), God says that person&rsquo;s faith is credited as righteousness.&nbsp; Importantly, this righteousness is credited <em>apart from works</em>.&nbsp; This could not be more clear.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tPaul could stop right there, for he&rsquo;s made his point.&nbsp; But in His mercy, God continues to make it clear that our faith in Christ is what saves us.&nbsp; In Romans 5, Paul makes a comparison of Adam and Jesus to really drive this point home.&nbsp; Romans 5 begins with &ldquo;<em>Therefore, having been justified by faith</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Justified how?&nbsp; By works?&nbsp; No, by faith.&nbsp; Although it does not say faith &ldquo;alone&rdquo; here, that is the clear implication.&nbsp; Paul goes on to compare how we were made sinners and how we are made righteous.&nbsp; Pay particular attention to the fact that in both cases, nothing was done on our part.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tFirst, Paul shows that we were made sinners by Adam&rsquo;s sin:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>12 Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (By the way, this is from where we get the doctrine of original sin.)&nbsp; Notice that we were made sinners because of what Adam did, not what we did.&nbsp; We sin because we are sinners.&nbsp; So, even before anyone else was born, sin and death were imputed (i.e., credited) to Adam&rsquo;s progeny.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSimilarly, we are made righteous not by what we do, but by what Jesus did.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>17 For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; 18 So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.&nbsp; 19 For as through the one man&rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAgain, this could not be more clear.&nbsp; Verse 19 is the key:&nbsp; Adam&rsquo;s disobedience made us sinners; Jesus&rsquo; obedience makes us righteous.&nbsp; This is done through what Scripture calls &ldquo;imputation&rdquo;, which means God imputes, or credits, Christ&rsquo;s righteousness to those who by faith believe in Him.&nbsp; Ironically, the Catholic church accepts the imputation of the sin nature from Adam.&nbsp; They also accept that Christ paid for our sins on the cross.&nbsp; Yet, amazingly, they reject the imputation of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness (see Canon XI above).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe Catholic response is almost always the same:&nbsp; the only place in Scripture where it says &ldquo;faith alone&rdquo; is in James 2:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>24 You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This appears to be a contradiction to what Paul said about Abraham above.&nbsp; Ironically, James uses the example of Abraham to prove this point, just as Paul does in Romans 4.&nbsp; How do we resolve this apparent contradiction?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAs with any apparent contradiction, we must look at both passages and make sure we are interpreting them correctly <em>in context</em>.&nbsp; In Romans, Paul&rsquo;s clear intent was to demonstrate that we are saved by faith apart from works.&nbsp; This is self-evident from the passage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIn James, on the other hand, the context is not to contrast faith and works with respect to how one is saved, as it clearly was with Paul in Romans.&nbsp; Rather, James is discussing how we demonstrate our faith.&nbsp; The chapter begins with, &ldquo;<em>1 My brethren, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is discussing how his audience is not demonstrating the love that should come from their faith, especially when they show partiality (v. 2:9).&nbsp; He extends this to the person who does nothing to help his neighbor in need (vs. 15-16).&nbsp; A faith with no works is a dead faith; that is to say, it is no faith at all.&nbsp; James then uses Abraham to show that his faith was made manifest by his works when he offered his only son, Isaac, as a sacrifice to God.&nbsp; He trusted God so completely that he was willing to sacrifice Isaac, knowing God would have to raise him up again because He had promised to bring about the Messiah through Abraham&rsquo;s line.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tDid God not know that Abraham had faith?&nbsp; Surely He did, for God is the one who chose Abraham and gave him faith.&nbsp; So why test Abraham with his son Isaac, when God already had given Abraham faith?&nbsp; So others would know that Abraham had the faith that God gave him.&nbsp; Abraham was able to demonstrate to the world that he had faith.&nbsp; That is the context of James 2.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tTherefore, James&rsquo; point here is not to say that works saves us; otherwise, we&rsquo;d have a major contradiction in Scripture.&nbsp; Rather, James is explaining that if one has true saving faith, it will be demonstrated through works.&nbsp; This agrees completely with Ephesians 2:10.&nbsp; It is through our works that we show we are God&rsquo;s children, and that is how He is glorified.&nbsp; If we just sit around and say we have faith, how does that bring glory to God?&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The world can only know we have faith by our works.&nbsp; A. W. Tozer put it this way, &ldquo;The Bible recognizes no faith that does not lead to obedience, nor does it recognize any obedience that does not spring from faith. The two are opposite sides of the same coin.&rdquo;&nbsp; (We have a more detailed article on faith vs. works <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/does_james_tech_that_works_are_required_for_salvation/\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tEven if we thought James was saying that faith and works are necessary for salvation, Scripture clarifies that this is not a correct view, as we see in the following Scriptures.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>30 What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith; 31 but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law. 32 Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works</em>.&rdquo; (Romans 9)</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>8 More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, 9 and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith</em>.&rdquo; (Philippians 3)</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;<em>4 But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, 5 He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, 6 whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life</em>.&rdquo; (Titus 3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tPerhaps the strongest reaction to those who advocate that salvation is by faith in Christ plus anything else is found in Galatians 1.&nbsp; Even while the apostles were alive, Satan was already at work trying to corrupt the gospel.&nbsp; Judaizers had come to Galatia and were saying that in addition to faith in Christ, a person also had to be circumcised.&nbsp; Demonstrating how important the purity of the gospel is, Paul reacted strongly against the Judaizers:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>6 I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; 7 which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.&nbsp; 8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!&nbsp; 9 As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed</em>!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIn Galatians 2, Paul confirms salvation is by faith alone:&nbsp; &ldquo;1<em>5 We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles; 16 nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; For Paul (and all Scripture is God breathed), the purity of the gospel was paramount.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWhile the Reformation fought against the apostasy of the Catholic church, this same false doctrine of salvation by works is found in practically every false religion.&nbsp; Mormonism, Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, Islam, etc., all teach salvation is based on one&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; Although Satan hides the truth in many different false religions, the method is the same.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe answer to the jailer&rsquo;s question was straightforward:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>31 They said, &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We believe by faith, and by faith alone in Christ alone.&nbsp; This is the pure gospel that God restored through His faithful witnesses in the Reformation.&nbsp; May we be faithful to continue to teach and preach this pure, unadulterated, Biblical gospel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSoli Deo Gloria!</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI may have mentioned before that I like to find old junky furniture and refurbish it. I don&rsquo;t do it a lot, but as I have a need, I begin to look for a piece that will do the trick and in time stumble upon what is usually a happy accident. When I find a piece I love, I rarely feel constrained to use it according to its original purpose. I see it entirely for its potential to fill my need. For example, I am currently using a chest of drawers (or Chester Drawers, mysteriously, if you&rsquo;re from New England) to hold photos and scrapbooks. Another dresser is a stand-in for an entertainment center. I have an old stereo cabinet hiding my printer, paper and miscellaneous office paraphernalia beneath its hinged lid. That said, in spite of the way I use a dresser, for example, it is never actually transformed into an entertainment center, it only stands in place of one and serves that purpose. Or does it? Does its form or its use define an object? Does the object or its owner determine what it actually is?</p>\n<p>\n\tA friend and I have been having an ongoing and difficult (for me, anyway) conversation. In the midst of one of these dialogues the other day she accused me of enjoying the diversion of stripping, refinishing, and repurposing, because it satisfies a deep personal need for my<em><strong> own</strong></em> life. I thought at the time that it was a bunch of psychobabble, but would make for great article fodder which would surely benefit someone. Not me. But someone. Oddly, however, her comment has been working my nerves, and the thing I keep butting up against is the idea that you can paint things up any way you want, but that doesn&rsquo;t change what&rsquo;s underneath. A dresser is still a dresser; it only <em><strong>looks</strong></em> like an entertainment center. Melissa is still the same old sinner; she only <em><strong>looks</strong></em> like a Christian. (Wow. Do I actually <em><strong>believe</strong></em> that?!)</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;m trusting that there are some of you for whom that arrow hit its mark. I don&rsquo;t hope so; I just believe that there are others out there like me who have somehow never truly believed in the change. (Geez, could I get a little more confession going here!? I think my paint is starting to peel!) Some of us struggle so desperately with sins which seem to master no one but us that we begin to think that our salvation is all window dressing. We work really hard at keeping up appearances and we bury the fear that we&rsquo;re really only pretending to be what others have truly become.</p>\n<p>\n\tListen, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m telling myself (Yes, I literally have this dialogue in my head. One day the men in the white coats will come&hellip;). Here it is&hellip;The Guy who rescues you gets to say what you are. You think you&rsquo;re a dresser. So what? It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you think. He thinks you&rsquo;re an entertainment center and He&rsquo;s using you that way. So you still feel like a dresser. So what? It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you feel. He feels that you&rsquo;re an entertainment center&hellip;and He&rsquo;s using you that way. You say that makes you a pretender, a poser, a fake because underneath you&rsquo;re still a dresser. So what? It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say. He says you&rsquo;re an entertainment center, and He&rsquo;s using you that way! You belong to a new owner now. Stop fighting him to still be the dresser. Be what He says you are. He&rsquo;s the one who rescued you from the curb. He&rsquo;s the one who did the work of transformation. He gets to say what you are now. If He says you&rsquo;re an entertainment center and He&rsquo;s using you that way&hellip;then you are what you are even if you can&rsquo;t see it in the mirror. Stand there in your little corner of the room and <em><strong>believe Him anyway</strong></em>! (Three snaps in a Z formation!!)</p>\n<p>\n\tNow understand that there is abundant scriptural support for what I&rsquo;ve just said and if you look for it you will find it. (I am a new creation in Christ. The old has gone. The new has come! 2 Corinthians 5:17) (Who is the pot to back-talk the Potter? Romans 9:20) (My old life is now hidden with Christ! Colossians 3:3) The primary thing to keep in mind on this topic is that faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we can&rsquo;t see (Hebrews 11).&nbsp; I hope I have been transformed and have become a new creation, but I sure can&rsquo;t see it sometimes! Faith is trusting what <em><strong>He said</strong></em> more than I trust what <em><strong>I see</strong></em>.&nbsp; We truly have been forever changed if we are in Christ; we&rsquo;re just still stuck, for now, in our earthly bodies which are riddled with sin. We are in the process of being perfected and made holy while we live on this earth, but the way God sees it&hellip;we&rsquo;re already there because we&rsquo;ve been painted with the blood of Christ. We aren&rsquo;t the sole and only exception to the power of His transforming grace!! Every day that we choose to stand still beneath the flatscreen television and don&rsquo;t go looking for socks and underwear to fill our drawers, we become a little more convinced that what He says is true. We are what He says we are. I am what He says I am. You are what He says you are. Believe it.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI asked the Lord for some new material for my Verse by Verse contributions and I guess He took that as an invitation to begin teaching me some new things. I think He might have misunderstood&hellip;?</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;m still thinking about hearing the hard things, about being a cheetah, about what it means to open myself up to challenge, and change. And when you open yourself up to hard things&hellip;you get them. At this moment I am engrossed in a study of both Philippians and 1 Peter. Remarkable how similar they are, or maybe it&rsquo;s just that God is busy teaching me this particular lesson. The Sunday sermon and my small group study time both centered on the topic of suffering through trial. Rather than the word trial, however, I want to use the word test. When you&rsquo;ve been in a classroom digesting knowledge, how does the teacher know what you&rsquo;ve absorbed? A test. It comes from the teacher, for the purpose of proving what you&rsquo;ve learned, so that you can effectively use what you know. With that in mind, consider these words:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;<em>Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, just to take Him at His word; just to rest upon His promise and to know, &lsquo;Thus saith the Lord&rsquo;. Jesus. Jesus. How I trust Him. How I&rsquo;ve proved Him o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er. Jesus. Jesus. Precious Jesus. Oh for grace to trust Him more.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tReally? How many times have you sung this beautiful hymn together with the saints and made it a heartfelt request? &ldquo;Oh &ndash; for grace to trust Him more!!&rdquo; Have you ever stopped to think about <em><strong>how </strong></em>you learn to trust Him? (Cue Jeopardy music here.) You learn to trust Him when you&rsquo;re sure He&rsquo;ll fail you, but you believe Him anyway. You learn to trust Him through circumstances that make you think His words are a lie, but you believe them anyway. You learn to trust Him when what you feel is in conflict with what you know. You learn to trust Him when you test His word.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe author of that hymn, Louise M. Stead, watched helplessly from the shore as her husband drowned trying to save a young boy floundering in the water near where they were picnicking. She and her young daughter were left destitute. How do you think she came to be able to pen those words, &ldquo;how I <em><strong>trust </strong></em>Him&hellip;how I&rsquo;ve <em><strong>proved</strong></em> Him&rdquo;? She had her choice of things to believe, but she proved Christ to be sufficient; she and her daughter went on to be missionaries, carrying the gospel to a world with no hope, no God, and nothing to &ldquo;prove&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow here&rsquo;s the hard part for those of us in the American church &ndash; the part we don&rsquo;t want to hear &ndash; most tests are tests of simple daily obedience. They aren&rsquo;t the big glamorous romantic things we like to talk about being prepared for later. They aren&rsquo;t things like mission trips, persecution, death, or catastrophic loss. Most are the every day episodes of life where Jesus takes your chin in hand, looks you in the eye, and asks you to prove your lip service through the experience of obedience. It ain&rsquo;t glamorous and there are no kudos from a watching world, it&rsquo;s just you, the Teacher, and the test &ndash; Him testing you, you testing the word.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy husband and I had a major throw-down on Sunday and suddenly it was exam day. This was Jesus saying to me, &ldquo;Prove that you understand what I&rsquo;ve been teaching you, Melissa. Apply your knowledge to your experience. Let&rsquo;s see if this dog will hunt!&rdquo; Hmmm&hellip;what to believe&hellip;? What to believe&hellip;? Believe that I will surely be acquitted of holding a pillow over his head if I can just make it until bedtime? Or believe that I am a minister of reconciliation, a steward of grace, that by doing good I silence the talk of foolish men (ahem!) and that through purity and reverence and submission I can win over my man (and so can God) &ldquo;<em>Thus saith the Lord&rdquo;</em>?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, I&rsquo;m sorry to tell you that I chose the pillow option and bit my tongue, biding my time, plotting revenge, nursing a grudge, and lying in wait through the long hours of the night. (I wasn&rsquo;t<em><strong> really </strong></em>going to hold a pillow over his head&hellip;um&hellip; <em><strong>really</strong></em>!) Put a big red F at the top of that page!</p>\n<p>\n\tBut on the sweet wings of the dawn came the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s voice reminding me from both books I&rsquo;m studying that what I&rsquo;ve learned from Christ is servant submission. He did not retaliate, he made no threats, (he committed no homicide) but instead he humbled himself and entrusted himself to the one who judges justly. So, praying feverishly just to believe that good could come from doing the same, and for the strength to obey and to trust God to prove that this works, I put my feet over the edge of the bed and onto the floor. Within minutes, my husband had apologized (as had I) and we were on the path to peace. Words tested. Words proven. Glory. Glory hallelujah.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus.<br />\n\tJust to take him at his word.<br />\n\tJust to rest upon his promise and to know, &lsquo;Thus saith the Lord&rsquo;.<br />\n\tJesus. Jesus. How I trust him. How I&rsquo;ve proved him o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er.<br />\n\tJesus. Jesus. Precious Jesus.<br />\n\tOh for grace to trust him more.&rdquo;<br />\n\tNow these words are my words. Truly mine. I&rsquo;ve proved them to be true, and I know I can trust them. I know I can trust Him. Oh! For grace to trust him <em><strong>more</strong></em>!<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tYou&rsquo;ve no doubt heard the saying, &ldquo;God helps those who help themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps you believe, like many Christians do, that this is in the Bible (it&rsquo;s not).&nbsp; Or, maybe you think, as do 84% of Christians, that this is a Biblical concept (it&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t).&nbsp; However, this is the type of thinking that existed in the Middle Ages, prior to the Reformation (and, to some extent, exists today).&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially, this teaches that while man is not perfect, we do have it within our power to do something to save ourselves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAt the time of the Reformation, the Catholic church taught that men are saved by God&rsquo;s grace, but also that men have free will, and that we must &ldquo;cooperate&rdquo; with God&rsquo;s grace in order to be saved.&nbsp; As Michael Horton notes, a popular medieval phrase was, \"God will not deny his grace to those who do what they can.&rdquo;&nbsp; More technically, the Catholic church officially (and &ldquo;infallibly&rdquo;) taught the following:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;The holy council declares first, that for a correct and clear understanding of the doctrine of justification, it is necessary that each one recognize and confess that since all men had lost innocence in the prevarication of Adam, having become unclean, and, as the Apostle says, by nature children of wrath, as has been set forth in the decree on original sin, they were so far the servants of sin and under the power of the devil and of death, that not only the Gentiles by the force of nature, but not even the Jews by the very letter of the law of Moses, were able to be liberated or to rise therefrom, <strong>though free will, weakened as it was in its powers and downward bent, was by no means extinguished in them</strong>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;It is furthermore declared that in adults the beginning of that justification must proceed from the predisposing grace of God through Jesus Christ, that is, from His vocation, whereby, without any merits on their part, they are called; that they who by sin had been cut off from God, <strong>may be disposed through His quickening and helping grace to <u>convert themselves to their own justification by freely assenting to and cooperating with that grace</u>; so that, while God touches the heart of man through the illumination of the Holy Ghost, man himself neither does absolutely nothing while receiving that inspiration, since he can also reject it, nor yet is he able by his own free will and without the grace of God to move himself to justice in His sight</strong>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Source:&nbsp; The Council of Trent, Session VI, Decree Concerning Justification, my emphasis)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAs you can see, the Catholic church taught (and still teaches) that God&rsquo;s grace is necessary for salvation, but that man must ultimately make the decision to believe or not, as he has the free will to reject God&rsquo;s grace.&nbsp; Sadly, there are many Christians that teach this same lie today.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tRelying solely on Scripture, the Reformers rejected this teaching.&nbsp; Instead, they taught that Scripture makes clear that man is saved by God&rsquo;s grace <em>alone</em>.&nbsp; With respect to the necessity of God to provide His grace in order for one to be saved, the Reformers wholeheartedly agreed, for that is what Scripture teaches.&nbsp; They rejected the notion that man has the ability in himself to reject or accept God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ.&nbsp; This is why there is a <em>sola</em> gratia.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThis doctrine is not only about God and His grace towards sinners, but also about the nature of man.&nbsp; Try asking this question to your Christian friends:&nbsp; &ldquo;Are people basically good?&rdquo;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how many will say yes.&nbsp; This is at the heart of sola gratia.&nbsp; Is there enough &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; left in after Adam&rsquo;s fall that we have the necessary ability to either accept or reject God&rsquo;s grace in Jesus Christ?&nbsp; Those who say yes believe man still has the ability (i.e., free will) to be good, limited as that may be (as the Catholic church teaches).&nbsp; Those who say no believe that man&rsquo;s nature as a result of Adam&rsquo;s fall was so great that we are totally depraved, with no power to do that which is good (as the Reformers taught).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNow, this does not mean that all people are as bad as they could be.&nbsp; Clearly, some are worse than others.&nbsp; It also does not mean that people cannot do &ldquo;good&rdquo; in human terms.&nbsp; It does mean that we are not capable of doing true good, that is, doing good with a heart to glorify and please God.&nbsp; Apart from faith in Christ, no one is good.&nbsp; Jesus made this clear when He said, &ldquo;<em>Why do you call Me good?&nbsp; No one is good except God alone</em>.&rdquo; (Mark 10:18)&nbsp; Then we read in Romans 3, &ldquo;<em>10 as it is written, &ldquo;There is none righteous, not even one; 11 There is none who understands, There is none who seeks for God; 12 All have turned aside, together they have become useless; There is none who does good, There is not even one</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finally, Hebrews 11 tells us, &ldquo;<em>6 And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWhy is it that we cannot do good, are not capable of being righteous, and do not seek after God?&nbsp; The reason is that when Adam sinned, he spiritually died.&nbsp; Because of his sin, all mankind is spiritually dead.&nbsp; This is why the Reformers taught that we have no free will with respect to do what is truly good, and that includes the ability to believe in Jesus as Lord and Savior, even with God&rsquo;s grace as the Catholic church taught.&nbsp; Ephesians 2 perhaps explains our plight best:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, 2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. 3 Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp; When we read we are &ldquo;dead&rdquo;, it can only mean spiritual death, because, obviously, we are physically alive.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t like to think of ourselves this way, but God tells us quite clearly that we were children of wrath, we followed the devil and the way of the world.&nbsp; We were dead to God.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSo, our problem is that we must be born again.&nbsp; Our Lord explains this clearly to Nicodemus in John 3:3,&nbsp; &ldquo;Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;<em>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.</em>&rdquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, Jesus here is not speaking of physical birth, but spiritual birth.&nbsp; The question, then, is how is this accomplished?&nbsp; We agree with the Catholic church that God&rsquo;s grace is necessary.&nbsp; But the Catholic church goes further and says that man must also act before he can receive justification, just as we read above.&nbsp; The problem the Reformers had with this is that a dead man can do nothing!&nbsp; If you bring a man who was shot to death to the operating room of the hospital and tell him, &ldquo;Okay, I brought you this far, now just get yourself up on that table and you&rsquo;ll be alright&rdquo;, what do you think he will do?&nbsp; Absolutely nothing, because he&rsquo;s dead.&nbsp; Likewise, if the gospel is given to someone, unless by God&rsquo;s grace they are born again, they cannot believe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tHow is one born again?&nbsp; Solely by an act of the Holy Spirit, apart from any action on man&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; Jesus elaborates for Nicodemus, &ldquo;<em>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is made clear in Ephesians 2 as well.&nbsp; After Paul tells us the bad news of our death, he follows up with the great news of our life:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 6 and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</em> <em>8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Notice what the Lord teaches us here.&nbsp; God made us alive.&nbsp; Salvation is <em>not of ourselves</em>, it is the <em>gift of God</em>.&nbsp; If man has free will and can decide to believe or not believe, then by definition it is a work and not a gift.&nbsp; Some will argue that we always have the choice to receive or reject a gift in human terms, so why not with God?&nbsp; The reason God saves us this way is so that no one may boast.&nbsp; If I choose to believe and someone else rejects the gift, then there is room for boasting.&nbsp; If salvation is all God&rsquo;s decision, then He alone will receive all the glory.&nbsp; And God makes clear that He shares his glory with no one:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>I am the Lord, that is My name; I will not give My glory to another, Nor My praise to graven images</em>.&rdquo; (Isaiah 42:8)&nbsp; The only thing we bring to our salvation is our sin, which is why we require a Savior in the first place.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe saying that God helps those who help themselves is often attributed to Benjamin Franklin, but most likely had earlier origins.&nbsp; Given that we are dead in our sins apart from Christ, praise God that He helps us who cannot possibly help ourselves.&nbsp; Even more, God does for us what we cannot do for ourselves.&nbsp; The man God rose up to begin the Reformation, Martin Luther, put it this way:&nbsp; &ldquo;We receive absolution and grace at no cost or labor on our part, but not without cost and labor on the part of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; May we live in such a way as to bring glory to God as we give thanks for His amazing grace.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSoli Deo Gloria!</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI volunteer one day a week at the Northwest Arkansas Children&rsquo;s Shelter. A little plug here for the work they do. They take in kids who are suddenly and unexpectedly removed from their home under &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; circumstances. Kids from birth to 16 (girls up to 18) can stay there for 45 days while their custody issues are sorted out. While they&rsquo;re there they can attend the on-site school where some of them jump a grade level or more simply from&hellip;attention. It is phenomenal work done by exemplary people and I am humbled to even be in the building with them. Now, lest you think too highly of me&hellip;I&rsquo;m just the school librarian. I am too scared to work with the kids (except the babies but they give me germs that make me very sad). Books are far more manageable and less fragile. In fact, I&rsquo;m not even there on library day. I just mitigate the damage done on those days and I keep the place operational.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause of flu season, which has our area in a tight grip, yesterday was unusual at the school, and the K-2 kids visited the library for an impromptu time-out. They came with the teacher&rsquo;s aide who had her help dog, Sierra, with her. Ms. Jan read to the kids out of a how-to-make-friends-with-a-dog book so that they would know how to approach Sierra, and how to generally be safe with strange dogs. I stood dutifully behind my station cataloguing books and hoping no one would ask me to watch the kids while they &ldquo;step out for a minute&rdquo;. God forbid!</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you&rsquo;re not the one trying to herd cats&hellip;er&hellip;supervise young children, you get to hear a lot more. Sometimes, like yesterday, it is especially entertaining. While Ms. Jan tried, with varying degrees of success, to maintain order among 6&hellip;count them&hellip;6 K-2 students and a dog I listened to the commentary as the kids talked over one another. From one: &ldquo;Sierra already knows <em><strong>my</strong></em> name.&rdquo;&nbsp; From another when Ms. Jan asked why we should never approach an injured dog: &ldquo;She might be faking it!&rdquo; And randomly shouted out above the crowd noise: &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re <em><strong>really</strong></em> a Cheetah&hellip;&rdquo;. I never heard the conclusion. We are left not knowing from the voice of experience how it is to <em><strong>really</strong></em> be a Cheetah&hellip;not just be <em><strong>faking</strong></em> being a Cheetah.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Ms. Jan finished up her discussion she told the children that some dogs are not friendly dogs. Some dogs bite. One little boy soulfully replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that so I won&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo; I froze in my shoes as the impact of that statement struck home. How often have I not wanted to hear the truth because it was too scary, too hurtful, too demanding, too convicting, too disillusioning, too disappointing, too sad, too hard? Too many times to count.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;m not sure where to go with that. I sit here, hands poised over the keys as waves of futility and hopelessness wash over me, and I sigh. I sigh for the lost value of friends who will tell you that you stink - your attitude stinks, your behavior stinks, your language stinks, your perspective stinks&hellip;you just plain stink. I sigh for our desperate self-preservation which does not invite that input or value that commentary on our lives. I sigh because what we do value is affirmation of the worst kind &ndash; the kind that leaves us exactly as we were before. Unchallenged. Unmoved. Unchanged. I sigh because those words could have left my mouth a million times over. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that so I won&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo; La la la&hellip;I can&rsquo;t hear you!!!</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the book of John, chapter six, Jesus challenges those who had been following him with what they called a &ldquo;hard teaching&rdquo;. They asked themselves, &ldquo;Who can accept it&rdquo;, and shrugging their shoulders walked away. The whole account is rich beyond measure, but when you come to verses 67 and 68, you reach the crux of the issue. &ldquo;You do not want to leave too, do you?&rdquo; Jesus asked the twelve. Simon Peter answered him, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe words of eternal life. Hard words. Words that are easier to avoid. Words that pierce and divide. Words that are God-breathed; and we call it bad breath. We don&rsquo;t want to hear it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that so I won&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo; La la la&hellip;I can&rsquo;t hear you.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo where do we go from here? If the words of eternal life are hard, we can&rsquo;t have one without the other, can we? And I&rsquo;m talking about more than having our fire insurance. We are far more willing to accept that we must eat the bread and drink the blood than the Jews were, aren&rsquo;t we? I don&rsquo;t know. Are we? (Spoiler: I&rsquo;m about to get up in your business!) When I stepped to the altar with my &lsquo;profession of faith&rsquo; did I understand that I was associating myself with an enemy of the world? A rebel with no place to lay his head? A homeless dude? Did I know that to be friends with Him meant turning my back on EVERYTHING else? Did I accept that he has the right to rule my life, boss me around and tell me that I stink? Did I accept those as the words of eternal life &ndash; or did I say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that part. I&rsquo;ll follow as long as it&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>\n\tMaybe I did accept all that at first and then things got&hellip;hard. Hard like, &ldquo;God hates divorce&rdquo; hard. Hard like, &ldquo;let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouth&rdquo; hard. Hard like, &ldquo;Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes&rdquo; hard. Hard like, &ldquo;I will set before my eye no vile thing&rdquo; hard. Hard like, &ldquo;food for the stomach and the stomach for food but the Lord will destroy them both&rdquo; hard. Hard like, &ldquo;forgive us our trespasses as (in the same measure) we forgive those who trespass against us&rdquo; hard.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me <strong><em>that</em></strong>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, these are the words of eternal life. These are the words that will save us. Save us from our selves. Save us from uselessness. Save us from grief and sadness and polluted lives. Save us from destruction and from becoming a destroyer. They are the words that breathe life back into our family, our marriage, our work. They are the words that challenge and move and change us. But we don&rsquo;t want to hear them. So we won&rsquo;t be afraid. Because they will reveal the truth about us&hellip;and the truth that we don&rsquo;t really want to be changed.</p>\n<p>\n\tI won&rsquo;t sermonize any more. I trust that the Holy Spirit has spoken to your heart if you&rsquo;ve welcomed His voice. I will leave you with a little fill in the blank if you&rsquo;ll allow me to tweak the previous unfinished declaration, &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re <em><strong>really</strong></em> a Cheetah&hellip;&rdquo;. Ask the Lord to help you examine yourself as you attempt to complete the assertion, &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re <strong><em>really</em></strong> a Christian&hellip;&rdquo;. Is that too hard? Do you want me to not ask that? La la la&hellip;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tYou may remember when you were a child (or now as a parent) and your Dad told you to go clean your room.&nbsp; You might have asked, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;&nbsp; And you likely remember the answer:&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I said so!&rdquo;&nbsp; No reason given, just because Dad says to do it.&nbsp; Within the family, parental authority supersedes all other authority; there is no higher authority to which a child can appeal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAuthority was a key issue of the Reformation.&nbsp; While the primary, or material issue was justification by faith alone (that is, how is one saved), a logical question was, &ldquo;Says who?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Catholic church denied this doctrine, while the Reformers proclaimed it.&nbsp; Who was right, and why were they right?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAt the time of the Reformation, the Catholic church was extremely powerful.&nbsp; They controlled kings and governments.&nbsp; What the pope and the bishops said with respect to faith and morals were deemed to have God given authority, with the papacy being instituted by Jesus upon Peter and then passed down throughout the ages in a supposed apostolic line of popes.&nbsp; Believers under their rule were therefore obliged to follow the church&rsquo;s decrees.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tFollowing these decrees was not a problem at first.&nbsp; Scripture makes clear that we are to be submissive to those in authority over us (e.g., Hebrews 13:17, 2 Corinthians 10:8, 1 Peter 5:5), and believers should generally have no problem with this.&nbsp; Indeed, Sola Scriptura does not negate church authority; rather, it places church authority in submission to the word of God.&nbsp; Therefore, all Christians should embrace such God ordained authority.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe problem arose when the Catholic church began teaching that which is contrary to Scripture.&nbsp; As mentioned above, the primary issue was how one is saved.&nbsp; Over time, the gospel became perverted, and the Catholic church began teaching a gospel of works.&nbsp; Along the way, there were always believers who believed in the true gospel.&nbsp; However, it was the Lord&rsquo;s timing to reform His church and fully bring back the true gospel at the time of the Reformation, primarily through the Catholic monk, Martin Luther.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe Catholic church&rsquo;s response to the Reformation was that they had God ordained authority, so that what they taught was therefore correct, and church members had no higher authority to which they could appeal.&nbsp; Martin Luther thought otherwise.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t(By the way, as an aside, the Catholic church&rsquo;s official teaching is that Scripture and Tradition (with a &ldquo;capital T&rdquo;) are co-equal.&nbsp; The Catholic catechism, which represents official, &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; beliefs of the Catholic church, states the following:&nbsp; &ldquo;77 In order that the full and living Gospel might always be preserved in the Church the apostles left bishops as their successors.&nbsp; They gave them their own position of teaching authority.\"&nbsp; Indeed, \"the apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a special way in the inspired books, was to be preserved in a continuous line of succession until the end of time.\"&nbsp; 78 This living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit, is called Tradition, since it is distinct from Sacred Scripture, though closely connected to it.&nbsp; Through Tradition, \"the Church, in her doctrine, life and worship, perpetuates and transmits to every generation all that she herself is, all that she believes.\"&nbsp; \"The sayings of the holy Fathers are a witness to the life-giving presence of this Tradition, showing how its riches are poured out in the practice and life of the Church, in her belief and her prayer.\"&hellip;80 \"Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound closely together, and communicate one with the other.&nbsp; For both of them, flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together in some fashion to form one thing, and move towards the same goal.\"&nbsp; Each of them makes present and fruitful in the Church the mystery of Christ, who promised to remain with his own \"always, to the close of the age\".&nbsp; 81 \"Sacred Scripture is the speech of God as it is put down in writing under the breath of the Holy Spirit.\"&nbsp; \"And [Holy] Tradition transmits in its entirety the Word of God which has been entrusted to the apostles by Christ the Lord and the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; It transmits it to the successors of the apostles so that, enlightened by the Spirit of truth, they may faithfully preserve, expound and spread it abroad by their preaching.\"&nbsp; <strong>82 As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, \"does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone.&nbsp; Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honored with equal sentiments of devotion and reverence</strong>.\"&rdquo; (Source:&nbsp; Catholic Catechism, my emphasis added)&nbsp; That last sentence is the key:&nbsp; clearly, the Catholic church views their authority from both Scripture and Tradition, and this remains their official teaching to this day.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tGetting back to Luther.&nbsp; Because of his teachings, Luther was hauled before several Catholic bishops to explain himself, why he thought he could go around the church&rsquo;s teachings.&nbsp; Indeed, they demanded that Luther recant what he taught.&nbsp; Luther met with church officials at the Diet of Worms in 1521, where he gave his famous speech:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;Unless I am convinced by proofs from Scriptures or by plain and clear reasons and arguments, I can and will not retract, for it is neither safe nor wise to do anything against conscience.&nbsp; Here I stand.&nbsp; I can do no other.&nbsp; God help me.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tClearly, Luther was appealing to a higher authority, namely, Scripture.&nbsp; To the extent the teaching of the Catholic church ran contrary to Scripture, Luther placed Scripture ahead of the church.&nbsp; Many Christians before Luther did the same thing, and paid for it with their lives, as the Catholic church executed these believers.&nbsp; We see a similar situation in the book of Acts.&nbsp; When the Jewish religious leaders commanded Peter and John to stop spreading the gospel, they gladly disobeyed:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;<em>17 But so that it will not spread any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any man in this name.&rdquo;&nbsp; 18 And when they had summoned them, they commanded them not to spea</em><em>k or teach at all in the name of Jesus.&nbsp; 19 But Peter and John answered and said to them, &ldquo;Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge; 20 for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard</em>.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe Old Testament likewise testifies to God&rsquo;s word as the ultimate authority.&nbsp; Speaking of the Jews who strayed from the Lord and His word, Isaiah says, &ldquo;<em>19 When they say to you, &ldquo;Consult the mediums and the spiritists who whisper and mutter,&rdquo; should not a people consult their God?&nbsp; Should they consult the dead on behalf of t</em><em>he living?&nbsp; 20 To the law and to the testimony!&nbsp; If they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; How does God tell us to consult Him?&nbsp; To the &ldquo;law and the testimony&rdquo;, that is, to His word.&nbsp; If a person teaches contrary to His word, it is as if they are leading someone into darkness.&nbsp; Only God&rsquo;s word &ldquo;<em>is a lamp to my feet And a light to my path</em>.&rdquo; (Psalm 119:105)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tEven the apostle Paul commended the Bereans for testing what he taught about Christ against the Scriptures.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>10 The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.&nbsp; 11 Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they receiv</em><em>ed the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.&nbsp; 12 Therefore many of them believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men</em>.&rdquo; (Acts 17)&nbsp; Notice that they believed, in part, because what Paul taught agreed with God&rsquo;s word.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAs you can see, Scripture itself testifies to the truth of Sola Scriptura.&nbsp; Since this is the very word of God, Scripture has ultimate authority over all believers.&nbsp; As in the Reformation, this should be our view today.&nbsp; We should fully submit to those in authority over us in the church, but only so far as what they teach is in line with God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; Although God has set elders, pastors, and teachers in authority over the church, they themselves must submit to the word of God.&nbsp; This is the essence of Sola Scriptura, that God&rsquo;s word is the ultimate authority, and is the infallible rule of faith for the church.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe doctrine of Sola Scriptura is the foundation of the five solas of the Reformation.&nbsp; The reason for this is that there has to be an ultimate authority that can say &ldquo;because I say so.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot proclaim that salvation is by grace alone by faith alone through Christ alone to the glory of God alone if we cannot say why this is true.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s word provides the foundation for this truth.&nbsp; It is this truth that every false religion always attacks. Catholicism makes their church&rsquo;s teaching equal with God (even though some of their teaching contradicts God&rsquo;s word).&nbsp; Mormonism adds the book of Mormon and says God&rsquo;s word is &ldquo;corrupted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Islam adds the Qur&rsquo;an and also says the Bible is corrupted.&nbsp; Even Judaism rejects the New Testament and refuses to acknowledge the Old Testament&rsquo;s teaching that Jesus is the Messiah.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIf God&rsquo;s word can shown to be unreliable, errant, or even false, then everything about Christianity comes into question.&nbsp; This attack comes from the same source:&nbsp; Satan.&nbsp; This is exactly what he did with Eve, asking her &ldquo;has God said?&rdquo;, and then added to God&rsquo;s word, telling Eve that surely she would not die.&nbsp; This is Satan&rsquo;s modus operandi, and it&rsquo;s been the same throughout time.&nbsp; Therefore, Sola Scriptura was not only the foundation of the Reformation, it should also be our foundation.&nbsp; Indeed, the Word was made flesh, thus Sola Scriptura is, in effect, another way to say Christ alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Acts 4:12)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSoli Deo Gloria!</p>"

It&#39;s very scenic and often breathtakingly beautiful in the mornings. Mist rises from a stream that wanders through the open fields and the sun glistens off the frost in the trees and grass, and the cows are about their morning routines. This morning as I was coming home I noticed one large black cow (forgive me if it should be called something different, but I am a city-girl after all) standing alone with mist rising all around it at the edge of the stream.&nbsp; It had its neck extended as far as it would go, muzzle to the sky, expelling what can only be called a bellow. Its breath hung around its nose in a great cloud from the effort to push the sound from its very soul - if you&#39;ll pardon the erroneous application.&nbsp; I laughed in agreement and said out loud to the Lord, \"Yeah! What he said!\"</p>\n<p>\n\tI must have an affinity for cows because I often see myself there. I know we&#39;re supposed to be sheep, but cows speak to me. I could feel the effort, the need, and the inability to express its feelings in a more productive way in that cow&#39;s bellow. It was a gut response, a letting-off, a vent, like an old-time pressure cooker about to blow. It was pent-up, unexpressed need.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe book of Romans tells us that the Holy Spirit intercedes for us in groans that words can not express. That&#39;s always been a balm to my soul - knowing that SOMEONE has the words when I don&#39;t. That&#39;s what the cow reminded me of today. (Not to liken our dear Holy Spirit to a large black bovine but you hopefully get the point.) I&#39;m telling you that sometimes if I could put my nose in the air and make that kind of noise, I would, and I would feel better for it, trusting that God understood everything that was behind it. So today, I just nodded in agreement and said, essentially, AMEN.</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIn our day, many Christians are not familiar with church history.&nbsp; They may know what the Bible says about the early church (e.g., Acts), but they know little about what happened after that up until our day.&nbsp; While knowing this history is obviously not necessary to be a Christian, you&rsquo;ve likely heard the old saying:&nbsp; &ldquo;Those who are ignorant of history are likely to repeat its mistakes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore, it&rsquo;s useful to study church history.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tPerhaps the most famous period of church history is the Reformation.&nbsp; During the middle ages, the church fell into a dark period.&nbsp; Many people did not know how to read, and relied solely on their priest to teach them what the Bible said.&nbsp; The problem was that many church teachers themselves stopped teaching the Bible (not too unlike today, sad to say).&nbsp; Eventually, the gospel itself was transformed into a gospel of works rather than a gospel of grace.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThankfully, in His time, God set forth in motion events that would bring back the truth of the gospel.&nbsp; Although many believers through the ages, including the Middle Ages, continued to preach and believe the true gospel, it was through a German monk that God would bring about what we know today as &ldquo;The Reformation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This monk&rsquo;s name was Martin Luther.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe history of the Reformation is quite long, but what I&rsquo;d like to discuss are some of the most important beliefs that emanated from the Reformation.&nbsp; These are known as the &ldquo;five solas of the Reformation.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are five beliefs that emerged as most prominent in the Reformers&rsquo; teaching, and were in direct contradiction to the main teaching of the Catholic Church.&nbsp; These &ldquo;solas&rdquo; were not necessarily listed by any given teacher, but rather were part of the Reformers&rsquo; teaching overall.&nbsp; Somewhere along the line, these five solas became the rallying cry of the Reformation, again, over against the Catholic church.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tI&rsquo;ll discuss each sola in individual articles, but briefly list them here.&nbsp; They are:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t<em>Sola Scriptura</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t<em>Sola Fide</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t<em>Sola Gratia</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t<em>Solus Christus</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t<em>Soli Deo Gloria</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe word &ldquo;sola&rdquo; is Latin for &ldquo;alone&rdquo;.&nbsp; What the five solas meant were:&nbsp; our sole authority came from Scripture alone; salvation was by faith alone by grace alone through Christ alone; and it was to God alone belonged all glory.&nbsp; This was contrary to Catholicism&rsquo;s teaching that one was saved by faith and works (which is what the Catholic church still teaches to this day), among other false teaching.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tI have found that most Christians today are completely unaware of this teaching, or of the Reformation itself.&nbsp; Given that the Reformation truly brought about a reformation of the church by bringing back the true gospel, and that today the &ldquo;evangelical&rdquo; church has in many ways reverted to a gospel of works, knowing about the five solas and what they mean is helpful for us today.&nbsp; Not only is it a concise reminder of the great salvation that God has wrought in us, it is also useful to keep us always on the right track, in sync with Scripture, so that we do not revert back to a gospel of works.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe first &ldquo;sola&rdquo; we&rsquo;ll examine is Sola Scriptura, which will come in the next article.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSoli Deo Gloria!</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t&iexcl;Feliz D&iacute;a de Reyes!&nbsp; Literally, &ldquo;Happy Day of Kings!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn church tradition January 6 marks the Feast of Epiphany.&nbsp; Epiphany can mean &ldquo;shining forth&rdquo;, as in the shining forth of Jesus as God.&nbsp; Epiphany can also mean an awakening or realization.&nbsp; Where I grew up, Puerto Rico, and in many other Latin American countries, January 6, not December 25, was originally the day people would give each other gifts, while Christmas was always celebrated in the church, as a religious holiday.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWith time, the tradition of Santa Claus spread into Latin America.&nbsp; So I got a sweet deal.&nbsp; When I was growing up, kids got gifts on both Christmas Day and on Three Kings Day.&nbsp; On January 5, children would go out into the yard and fill up a shoe box with grass to feed the camels the three kings traveled on, of course.&nbsp; We placed the boxes beneath the bed and woke up the next day to find toys and presents, and the grass was gone.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a girl, we always assumed there were three of them, maybe because the scripture account mentions three gifts presented to the child.&nbsp; We even had names for them Melchior, Gaspar and Balthazar.&nbsp; (I have no idea where the names came from, but I&#39;m sure someone made them up, as they are nowhere in scripture.)&nbsp; And we always picture them arriving on &ldquo;Christmas night&rdquo; at the manger.&nbsp; We even do that in our Christmas pageants; the magi always arrive a song or two after the angels and shepherds show up, right?&nbsp; But let&#39;s take a closer look at the passage that describes their arrival:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 2:1&nbsp; Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying,<br />\n\tMatt. 2:2 &ldquo;Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.&rdquo;<br />\n\tMatt. 2:3 When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.<br />\n\tMatt. 2:4 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.<br />\n\tMatt. 2:5 They said to him, &ldquo;In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is what has been written by the prophet:<br />\n\tMatt. 2:6&nbsp; &lsquo;And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, &#8232;<br />\n\t&nbsp; Are by no means least among the leaders of Judah;&#8232;<br />\n\t&nbsp; For out of you shall come forth a Ruler&#8232;<br />\n\t&nbsp; Who will shepherd My people Israel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 2:7&nbsp;Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined from them the exact time the star appeared.<br />\n\tMatt. 2:8&nbsp;And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, &ldquo;Go and search carefully for the Child; and when you have found Him, report to me, so that I too may come and worship Him.&rdquo;<br />\n\tMatt. 2:9&nbsp;After hearing the king, they went their way; and the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood over the place where the Child was.<br />\n\tMatt. 2:10&nbsp;When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.<br />\n\tMatt. 2:11&nbsp;After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.<br />\n\tMatt. 2:12&nbsp;And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, the magi left for their own country by another way.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tAfter reading the passage it is clear that there is no indication in the text that would tell us there were exactly three magi.&nbsp; There is also nothing in the text that specifies they were kings.&nbsp; Then, if we look at verse 9, it tells us that the star they had followed all the way to Jerusalem came to rest over over the place where the child was, and verse 11 tells us it was a house, not a manger.&nbsp; This means that the visit happened sometime while Jesus was still a very young child, a baby, but after His family had moved out of the stable.&nbsp; Maybe we don&#39;t know as much about these three? kings? as we thought.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat do we know?&nbsp; We know that this was a group of men who came from the East, following a star.&nbsp; Scripture calls them magi, which in the Greek could mean a sorcerer, diviner, or astrologer.&nbsp; A &#39;magos&#39; was one who could interpret the oracles of a particular deity.&nbsp; They came from the East, which would indicate they came from Babylon.&nbsp; But how did they know that a Messiah would be born?&nbsp; How did they know when, and where?&nbsp; Whatever made them follow that strange &#39;star&#39;?&nbsp; They learned about all of this in the Word of God, the writings of the Hebrew prophets.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese magi from the court of Babylon would have had access to the writings of a particular ancient Hebrew prophet who had been a highly respected member, the chief of the court of magi during Israel&#39;s time of captivity in Babylon, the prophet Daniel.&nbsp; The book of Daniel foretold of a great event in the history of the Hebrew people, the arrival of a Messiah who would be the ruler over all Israel.&nbsp; And since then, the magi of Babylon had known to be vigilant of this prophecy being fulfilled.&nbsp; Chapter 9 of Daniel offers a specific timeline that told them the exact year the Messiah would be born.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tAstrology and astronomy were one and the same discipline back then.&nbsp; As astronomers the wise men had extensive knowledge of stars and their position; as astrologers they assigned religious significance to star movements and configurations.&nbsp; They would have noticed the appearance of a new heavenly body.&nbsp; The star&#39;s movement west, along with the timing and other cues in scripture, would have triggered them to follow it to find this king the prophecy foretold.&nbsp; A group of gentiles, of pagan priests, believed the Word of God, and this belief granted them the opportunity to worship at the feet of Jesus. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t(You can hear more about this by listening to <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/christmas_2012_message/wise_men_of_babylon/\">The Wise Men of Babylon</a></strong>.)</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what has always been curious to me is the way the magi arrived in Jerusalem:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 2:1&nbsp; Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying,<br />\n\tMatt. 2:2 &ldquo;Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn verse 2 the first thing out of their mouths is, &ldquo;Where is He?&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, I have heard sermon after sermon propose that once in Jerusalem the magi stopped at Herod&#39;s castle to ask for directions.&nbsp; But that is not exactly what the text says.&nbsp; It says that when Herod heard, he was greatly troubled, perhaps when he got wind of it somehow.&nbsp; The wise men didn&#39;t need directions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThey had followed a star all the way from Babylon; God wouldn&#39;t just leave them stranded at the tail end. &nbsp;Verse 9 says that same star took them straight to the very house where the child was.&nbsp; No, I would think the magi asked their question at the city gate.&nbsp; After all that is where all official business took place and where you inquired about anything important.&nbsp; This kind of message would have been relayed to Herod immediately.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe wise men were asking where they could go worship the one who had been born king of the Jews.&nbsp; That was a direct threat to Herod&#39;s position.&nbsp; It is not until verse 7 that the magi are summoned into Herod&#39;s presence, after he has had a chance to confirm the information with the Jewish priests (v. 4-6).</p>\n<p>\n\tLet&#39;s think about what would prompt the magi to arrive at the city and immediately ask this question, &ldquo;Where is He who has been born King of the Jews?&rdquo;&nbsp; Consider these scenarios.&nbsp; You have been invited to a friend&#39;s house for Thanksgiving dinner and upon arriving you cheerfully ask, &ldquo;Where&#39;s the bird?&rdquo;&nbsp; Or you have been invited to watch the &#39;big game&#39; and when you come in you ask, &ldquo;What&#39;s the score?&rdquo;&nbsp; You assume there is a shared knowledge of a specific event that has brought you together.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tI would think the wise men assumed the same.&nbsp; After all, they had access to the same scriptures as the Hebrew people.&nbsp; And this Messiah had been promised to the people of this city by their God, through their prophet. They arrived in Jerusalem and asked, in my words, &ldquo;Where have you put your Messiah?&nbsp; We want to worship Him too.&nbsp; Where did you build His palace?&nbsp; Where do we stand in line?&nbsp; Where do we put these gifts?&nbsp; Surely we have not arrived too late to join you in your celebration.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat they did not expect was to meet with a city full of people who were too preoccupied with their circumstances, that they had no idea what the magi were talking about.&nbsp; If the wise men had been trained in the court of the magi to look forward to this event with anticipation, wouldn&#39;t they have expected the Jews to have done so even more?&nbsp; And this is where God draws a stark contrast between the Jews and the Gentiles of the day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThese pagan oracle-readers had enough reverence for the word of the God of Daniel, to believe it and act upon it.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Jewish priests and scribes knew the Word well; they were able to quote it to Herod on the spot (v. 6).&nbsp; But they did not take it to heart.&nbsp; They had access to the same information the magi did, yet they did not act on it.&nbsp; In the process they missed the opportunity to receive their savior.&nbsp; They also missed the opportunity to give Him a place of honor where the unbeliever could see Him exalted.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this January 6, that is my Epiphany.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is He?&rdquo;&nbsp; Where have I put my Savior and King?&nbsp; Is He in a prominent place in my life, where all who were to ask &#39;at the gate&#39; couldn&#39;t help but see Him in me?</p>"

I do know that the concept of God as we perceive it is inaccurate.&nbsp; God is basically what we do when we do the right thing. God is how I treat others.&nbsp; God is how I treat and how I respect myself.&nbsp; That is the essence of our purpose I believe, to accept ourselves with love and compassion and strive to help others to do the same.&nbsp; It sounds a lot easier than it actually is to do, but I have not had one moment of negative after effect from this experience and I know it is a great gift.&nbsp; Because of it, I have let go of so many unnecessary beliefs that had clogged my soul like a stuck drain pipe.&nbsp; I know now that I have a purpose even if I don&#39;t know exactly what it is, and that is okay.&nbsp; I saw no evidence of any \"Jesus\" or anything related to anything religious of any kind.&nbsp; I take that to form a belief that these serve us in life perhaps, creating a moral \"map\" some need to live life.&nbsp; For others it is confining and not positive.&nbsp; I am now free of any encumbrances of the old beliefs that I was once ruled by, and I thank the heavens (literally) for that.&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;I lost my faith; it was transformed into a complete trust in the promises of God.&nbsp; This changed me as a person and as a doctor.&nbsp; Trusting that God loves us unconditionally, that spiritual life is eternal and that He as a beautiful plan for each of us, allowed me to face struggles with gratitude and joy.&nbsp; Each event, neither good nor bad, is like a small thread woven together with others to create a glorious tapestry of God&#39;s design.&nbsp; I do not fear death.&nbsp; I am more tolerant of other people&#39;s actions.&nbsp; I observe the world with an open heart.&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;I am now an ordained minister and preach.&nbsp; I was shown there is no hell.&nbsp; We all go home.&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;While my body was out, my spirit was sent to hell.&nbsp; It was worse than I would have ever imagined.&nbsp; Besides the extreme uncomfortable feeling, I could not take a moment without being bumped into and grunted at.&nbsp; There were dark clay boxes of heat around the size of an old 27 inch TV and they were being moved around.&nbsp; It was crowded and you could not make out the faces.&nbsp; I could not tell if they were white, African, American, or Asian.&nbsp; They were just there.&nbsp; At this point I started screaming to God to please forgive me.&nbsp; The grunting got louder and I asked the Lord to please let me repent if I was to stay here.&nbsp; At the moment a light shined through and I gravitated toward it.&nbsp; I thanked God and begged him for forgiveness and I proclaimed that Jesus was the light and that I believed he was the only true and living God.&nbsp; I felt myself then being pulled toward the light.&nbsp; I knew without question that I had no doubts or worries that there was a Lord and at that moment I was out of hell.&nbsp; I wasn&#39;t in heaven and I felt like I was back on earth, yet I had no way of knowing.&nbsp; One thing I knew...I was spared hell!&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;Unlike other NDE experiences I have read about, I did not see anyone or feel the presence of Jesus, or Buddha, or Allah.&nbsp; Nor did I see a physical presence of any of my relatives that had passed before me-- although I had a feeling that they were there with me.&nbsp; What I did see was a much brighter place, perhaps 30 to 50 feet away, (I had no real clear understanding of depth ratio) that seemed almost to pull at my heart (if I had a heart) to come closer.&nbsp; I was awash with a complete feeling of peace, calm and contentment whenever I looked in the direction of this \"portal.\"&nbsp; And yet I knew, that moving into the portal would certainly mean that I would not be able to return to my life on earth.&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t&ldquo;Standing in front of me was the most awesome sight - I could see a man standing in front of me, but he was not like anyone I&#39;d ever seen before in my life.&nbsp; His garments were shimmering white in color - garments of light - I could see His bare feet and His hands were outstretched towards me as if to welcome me.&nbsp; I knew I was looking upon God &hellip; as I looked toward His face the intensity of the light seemed to increase 7-fold - you couldn&#39;t make out the form of his face as the light was so bright - such purity, such holiness, such beauty.&nbsp; I asked God if I could step closer.&nbsp; I felt I could, I wanted to see His face.&nbsp; Moving closer waves of more Love began to flow towards me, and I felt very safe.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAgain, these statements could be viewed as being Biblical, especially by a relatively new or spiritually immature Christian.&nbsp; As we&rsquo;ll see, however, Scripture contradicts these NDEs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tFirst and foremost, Scripture makes clear that God&rsquo;s love is NOT unconditional.&nbsp; While it&rsquo;s true that God is love, it is also true that those who do not have faith in Jesus Christ are condemned.&nbsp; It does not logically follow that a condemned person would have the accepting, loving experience recorded by those who have had a NDE.&nbsp; Most Christians are familiar with John 3:16; what is not usually included with that verse is John 3:18:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, the vast majority of those who have reported NDEs are not Christians.&nbsp; Furthermore, if NDEs are true, then God accepts unbelievers; yet Jesus said, &ldquo;<em>I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me</em>.&rdquo; (John 14:6)&nbsp; To be accepted by God, one must believe in Christ; God&rsquo;s love is conditioned on faith in Christ.&nbsp; Without faith, it is impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6), and one can only expect judgment and wrath.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tMost of these people also talk about feeling overwhelming love and acceptance; there is no fear of this bright light being.&nbsp; Yet, Scripture says that our God is a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29).&nbsp; Whenever people were in God&rsquo;s presence, they were fearful, even when in front of God in the spiritual realm (i.e., not in the flesh).&nbsp; For example, the apostle John, the one whom Jesus loved, upon encountering the exalted Christ in Revelation 1 said, &ldquo;<em>When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; If an apostle, a Christian whom the Holy Spirit says is the one Jesus loved falls like a dead man in the presence of God, I am certain that would be even more true for an unbeliever.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNotice, too, that the one NDE describes Jesus as having &ldquo;bare feet&rdquo;.&nbsp; Revelation 1:15 says, &ldquo;<em>His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this is how John saw Jesus, why should we expect Him to look different to others?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tMost say they do not fear death.&nbsp; Yet Scripture makes clear that those who are not in Christ do fear death, because of the punishment that will come with it.&nbsp; Hebrews 9:27 says that it is appointed for man to die once, and then the judgment.&nbsp; The same chapter about God being love quoted above (John 4) goes on to say this:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>9 By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins&hellip;.. 17 By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world.&nbsp; 18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only Christians, who are saved from God&rsquo;s wrath, should not fear death.&nbsp; Unbelievers should rightly fear death, because God&rsquo;s punishment awaits them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who have had a NDE but are not Christian have an incredibly false sense of peace when they should rightly fear death because of the punishment it will bring.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tPerhaps most interesting to me was what Eben Alexander said about his NDE.&nbsp; In an interview with Oprah Winfrey (and anything &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; coming from Oprah Winfrey should be a huge red warning flag to Christians), Mr. Alexander made some interesting statements.&nbsp; First, he said that God was not &ldquo;about a religion that separates, divides&rdquo;.&nbsp; Indeed, any religion that believes it&rsquo;s &ldquo;better&rdquo; than another, or that &ldquo;sets up conflict&rdquo; is &ldquo;not part of that all loving God&rdquo;.&nbsp; Again, this does not square at all with Scripture.&nbsp; Listen to what our Lord says in Matthew 10:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>34 &ldquo;Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.&nbsp; 35 For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 36 and a man&rsquo;s enemies will be the members of his household.&nbsp; 37 &ldquo;He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.&nbsp; 38 And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.&nbsp; 39 He who has found his life will lose it, and he who has lost his life for My sake will find it</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; If that&rsquo;s not separation, division, or conflict, then I don&rsquo;t know what is.&nbsp; Clearly, Mr. Alexander&rsquo;s &ldquo;experience&rdquo; does not square with the truth of Gods&rsquo; word.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIf these NDEs contradict Scripture, they are not from God.&nbsp; So, what are they?&nbsp; Some speculate that NDEs are caused by some malfunction in the brain; in other words, it&rsquo;s purely physical.&nbsp; This would account for the similarity of the experiences.&nbsp; However, it begs the question as to why everyone views the NDE as an encounter with God (or a god like being).&nbsp; Furthermore, I find it interesting that the vast majority of people who experience a NDE are deceived into believing that God loves everyone unconditionally, or that the being of light is not the God of the Bible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tPersonally, I believe this is Satanic.&nbsp; If Satan can deceive people in the earthly realm, it stands to reason that he can do the same in the spiritual realm.&nbsp; In that sense, there may be a lot of truth to the NDE that people have.&nbsp; They may truly leave their body, go through a tunnel and see a being of light.&nbsp; They may really feel unconditional love, safety and peace.&nbsp; But this being is clearly a deceiving spirit.&nbsp; Speaking of false apostles, Scripture says, &ldquo;<em>13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14 No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15 Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds</em>.&rdquo; (2 Corinthians 11)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIn conclusion, NDEs, although they may actually occur, are not true, at least as far as they concern God, and who He is and what He is like.&nbsp; They are intended to lead people astray from the true God, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Like anything that seeks to teach us about God, we should test it.&nbsp; 1 John 4 says &ldquo;<em>1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The way we test the spirits is to compare what they say to the word of God.&nbsp; Thanks be to God for giving us His word and His Holy Spirit to guide us.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tOn the way to my volunteer day I always stop to get a soda at the local grab-n-go-gas-station. This morning as I was driving I was also listening to Chuck Swindoll preach on Romans 8. This chapter has a special place in my heart. Mostly because it comes before the thorny chapter 9. I tend to want to call an end the letter to the Romans with those final beatific words of 8, <em>&ldquo;For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>\n\tI pulled into the station mid-way through Pastor Swindoll&rsquo;s message, and turning the car off left me mid-thought that nothing can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. I believe this. I have overcome some lies in my life and reached a place where I know that I know, that even <em><strong>I</strong></em> am not bigger than this love. Even <em><strong>I</strong></em> can not do anything so bad that God would cease to love me. But what stuck with me (pardon the pun) this day was that nothing can <em><strong>separate</strong></em> me from His love. Pondering what this might look like, feel like, I went on in to the station to grab my soda.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou know it always happens to me this way &ndash; in the mundane moments of my life, God shows up. And there He was at the soda fountain. More specifically, at the lids. Uh huh&hellip;you&rsquo;re already there, aren&rsquo;t you? You know, if you have ever purchased a soda at a gas station, that there is simply no separating those stinking lids! You&rsquo;ve got one hand full of the soda, the other clutching keys, change, and straw, and you&rsquo;ve got to single handedly unstick one single lid from the factory run sleeve of plastic flanged nemeses! It can&rsquo;t be done. Two hands are required, long-suffering necessary, and firmly in place, a mind that is completely numbed to the thought that countless other hands have touched every&hellip;single&hellip;lid. As I was struggling against the laws of nature I was grumbling that life nor death, angels nor demons, present nor future&hellip;no not <em><strong>ANY</strong></em> power in all creation could separate those fool lids from one another! And then I saw me. And then I saw God. And I rejoiced over those confounded plastic lids stuck to one another as if forged as one piece.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s a silly thing &ndash; I&rsquo;m a silly kind of gal and that&rsquo;s where the Lord meets me &ndash; but still, I hope that when you&rsquo;re not sure that you know what you know, you can remember those maddening lids and be reassured that nothing&hellip;nothing&hellip; no, nothing can ever separate you from God&rsquo;s love. It&rsquo;s as if you were forged together as one.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tAre you superstitious?&nbsp; Gallup, the polling organization, reports that about 25% of Americans say they are.&nbsp; With respect to some of the particulars, Gallup reports:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;More than a quarter -- 27% -- said they were superstitious about \"knocking on wood,\" with 13% superstitious about a black cat crossing one&#39;s path, 12% about walking under a ladder, 11% about breaking a mirror, 9% about speaking ill of a person (that it will come true), and 9% about the number 13.&nbsp; Again, younger people (under 30) were more likely than older people (65 and older) to be superstitious about a black cat (19% vs. 12%), breaking a mirror (21% vs. 10%), speaking ill of a person (15% vs. 5%), and knocking on wood (38% to 18%).&nbsp; There was little difference in superstition by age on the other two items -- walking under a ladder and the number 13.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tI found it odd that only 9% of people say they are superstitious about the number 13.&nbsp; Companies go a long way to avoid 13 for only 9% of the population.&nbsp; Consider how many office buildings don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;13th&rdquo; floor.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking people weren&rsquo;t completely honest in the Gallup poll.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy question is should anyone be superstitious, but, more importantly, should Christians be superstitious?&nbsp; To help answer that, we first need to know exactly what superstition is, then we&rsquo;ll consider what Scripture has to say.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe dictionary definition of superstition is &ldquo;a belief or notion, not based on reason or knowledge, in or of the ominous significance of a particular thing, circumstance, occurrence, proceeding, or the like; irrational fear of what is unknown or mysterious, especially in connection with religion.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe key words here are &ldquo;not based on reason or knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;irrational fear of the unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp; When a person believes in a superstition, he attributes some power to something or someone he doesn&rsquo;t even know exists.&nbsp; For example, if walking under a ladder brings bad &ldquo;luck&rdquo;, what or whom causes this bad luck to occur?&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t know, then why believe you&rsquo;ll have bad luck?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s completely irrational.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven more irrational is the belief that the number 13 is bad luck.&nbsp; Consider the building that labels floor 13 as floor 14 (which I saw very recently).&nbsp; Does simply changing the label really make the 13th floor the 14th floor?&nbsp; Clearly not; the laws of mathematics do not change simply because we want to believe we can change them.&nbsp; Even if we call it the 14th floor, it&rsquo;s still floor 13.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat about superstitions and Scripture?&nbsp; Remember, a superstition implicitly assigns some power to something or someone to bring about bad luck.&nbsp; Yet Scripture says that God alone is all powerful, and controls everything that happens.&nbsp; Proverbs 16:9 says, &ldquo;In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.&rdquo;&nbsp; Proverbs 19:21 is similar:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMany are the plans in a man&#39;s heart, but it is the LORD&#39;s purpose that prevails.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIsaiah 46:10 states:</p>\n<h5>\n\tDeclaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things that are not yet done, Saying, &lsquo;My counsel shall stand, And I will do all My pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tFurthermore, the Lord says in Daniel 4:35:</p>\n<h5>\n\tAll the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; He does according to His will in the army of heaven And among the inhabitants of the earth.&nbsp; No one can restrain His hand Or say to Him, &ldquo;What have You done?<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tMy brother was born on Friday the 13th.&nbsp; My grandfather, being superstitious, was extremely upset about him being born on this day.&nbsp; Yet the date of his birth was directly appointed and controlled by God.&nbsp; Acts 17 says:</p>\n<h5>\n\t24 The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; 25 nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things; 26 and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAs Scripture makes clear, God controls all things and does as He pleases.&nbsp; If He is in control of everything, then it is irrational and unreasonable for a Christian (or anyone, for that matter) to be superstitious.&nbsp; Indeed, to be superstitious is to demonstrate that you do not believe what God has said in His word.&nbsp; Furthermore, God does not want us to be without reason (e.g., Isaiah 1:18).&nbsp; Therefore, a Christian should never be superstitious.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe should take great comfort in knowing that the Lord is in total, complete control of everything that happens.&nbsp; Moreover, even when something bad does happen to us, we can rest assured that He is using every situation for His glory and our good (Romans 8:28).&nbsp; So, feel free to walk under a ladder, break a mirror (preferably your own), stay on the 13th floor of the hotel, let a black cat cross your path, and enjoy all Friday the 13ths!&nbsp; Our God is in control!</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tI sat down here to write a completely different post, but when I checked my Facebook page before getting started I saw that a blogger I follow had a new post that I wanted to read. I did. It spoke to me. Now I want to speak to it&hellip;to her&hellip;to you&hellip;and to me. Her post was about how easy it is to fall into the darkness of cynicism where &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; is concerned. (Notice my quotation marks there, because &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; of which she speaks is the entangled mess that is the brick-and-mortar-Sunday-meeting-congregation and the true Body of Christ. If I can remember, I&rsquo;ll deal with that fallacy later.) Her post ended with the query, &ldquo;Tell me why it&rsquo;s good&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou all know that I changed churches recently. While I like my new church for many reasons, it isn&rsquo;t hard to find reasons to dislike it as well. It isn&rsquo;t hard to slip into cynicism and bitterness and boredom and apathy, and the thought occurs to me to run&hellip;run!...back to my old church. Until I begin to count the ways it too disappoints. See, that&rsquo;s the easy part. Counting the ways &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; disappoints us. But here&rsquo;s the thing&hellip;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tWe. Are. The Church.<br />\n\tYou.<br />\n\tAre.<br />\n\tThe Church.</p>\n<p>\n\tHas it occurred to you at any time, ever, that you, a member of &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; have been one big flaming disappointment to someone else in &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; who needed you to be all that Jesus called you to be? Ouch.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s easy to expect other people to supernaturally anticipate your emotional, physical and spiritual needs, but it seems rather ridiculous for someone else to expect that of you. You aren&rsquo;t a mind reader! People need to take responsibility for themselves and ask for help. Right?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tRiiiiiiiiiiight.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the most instructive things I heard early on in my church adventure came on the heels of some real disappointing experiences! Someone told me that &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; is just full of people like me.<em><strong> </strong></em>LIKE ME! Dude! (To use my son&rsquo;s vernacular!) That set me back! &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; is full of people, <em><strong>LIKE ME??!!</strong></em>&nbsp; Well then, we&rsquo;re in a boatload of hurt! Up a creek without the proverbial paddle. Lost as a goose in a snow storm. Blind leading the blind and all that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tUh huh.<br />\n\tNow you get it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis brick-and-mortar-Sunday-meeting-congregation that you have put your hopes in? It&rsquo;s made up of people like me. People like you. Needy people. Whiny people. Cynical people. Selfish people. Fearful, insecure, neurotic and evasive people. (That&rsquo;s an acronym for FINE, by the way. &ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo; we ask each other in church. &ldquo;FINE&rdquo;, we answer while judging them for not meeting our very needy needs.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tHere&rsquo;s my answer to the blogger&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;Tell me why it&rsquo;s good&rdquo;.<br />\n\tIt isn&rsquo;t good.<br />\n\tJesus is.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Jesus is no where as evidently good as He is in His Church, because it&rsquo;s full of people who desperately need(ed) saving! Praise the Lord that His mercy is fully sufficient in the wake of our silent judgments. Praise the Lord that His grace fully accepts those whom we have rejected and suspected. Praise the Lord for His loving kindness that soothes where we have wounded. Praise the Lord for His eternal faithfulness that covers our neglect. Praise the Lord that He says, &ldquo;Come you who are weary and I will give you rest&rdquo; even as we say, &ldquo;Work harder, longer, faster!&rdquo; Praise the Lord that He says, &ldquo;Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.&rdquo; Even while we say, &ldquo;Give! Give! Give sacrificially &ndash; Give till it hurts!&rdquo; Praise the Lord for One who is closer than a brother. Praise the Lord for Emmanuel &ndash; God with us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tGod.<br />\n\tWith.<br />\n\tUs.</p>\n<p>\n\tOh! How desperately we need Him! That&rsquo;s why even when &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; it isn&rsquo;t good, it&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s great because we recognize in others our own pitiful, vain, busy, neglectful, callous, flippant, insufficient, broken, limping, wounded, angry-dog selves&hellip;and we are reminded of Jesus. We are grateful for Jesus! We are left gasping in the wake of His love for us, drinking in His goodness, clinging to our Hope with otherwise empty hands. Face down in spirit if not in body. Humbled before our God. Savior. Messiah. Healer. Redeemer.</p>\n<p>\n\tListen&hellip;&rdquo;The Church&rdquo; is only as good as you are. It&rsquo;s only as good as I am. It&rsquo;s only as good as we are together. And that isn&rsquo;t good enough. Ever. If you are looking for &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; to be your all-in-all, you&rsquo;ve made it your idol, because only Jesus can be what you&rsquo;re asking &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; to be. If you don&rsquo;t figure out that all your answers are in Him&hellip;not in the Sunday sermon... you&rsquo;re going to end up like my blogger friend, sitting in your car on Sunday morning asking, &ldquo;Tell me why it&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; And you won&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while He is with them?\" Matthew 9:13a&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tWhen I was a relatively new Christian, I remember trying to figure out how to study the Bible.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>A class I took on this said that the best thing is to take what Scripture says literally, unless the text indicates otherwise.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>This has been a very good guide, as I&rsquo;ve found that most Scripture should be taken literally.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tOne passage that bugged me was when Jesus talked about plucking out your eye and cutting off your hand if either of them caused you to sin.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>The passage in Matthew 5 reads as follows (see also Mark 9):</p>\n<h5 class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t&ldquo;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">27 &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall not commit adultery&rsquo;; 28 but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>29 If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>30 If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to go into hell</i>.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tI usually heard this interpreted as something like, &ldquo;Well, Jesus didn&rsquo;t mean this literally.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>He was just speaking about how serious sin is.&rdquo;<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>While it&rsquo;s true that here Jesus is demonstrating the seriousness of sin, I actually think that He is being very literal.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>If your eye makes you sin, Jesus says literally pluck it out; if your hand causes you to sin, literally cut it off.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tWhat?<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Really?<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Well, before you pluck out your eye or cut off your hand, let&rsquo;s consider what Jesus is really saying.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tThis passage is in the context of Jesus&rsquo; sermon on the mount.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>He is talking about what a believer is like (for example, &ldquo;poor in spirit&rdquo; is a person who realizes he is a sinner, as opposed to a self righteous person).<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>He also speaks to the Law, but raises the bar, demonstrating the intent behind the Law.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, when He says you shall not commit adultery, He says if you look at a woman with lust you have already committed adultery.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Think about what this means.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Even if you&rsquo;ve never physically committed the act of adultery, just thinking about it is the same in God&rsquo;s view. <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span>That&rsquo;s a pretty heavy message.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Then, as if to pile it on, Jesus says if your eye causes you to sin (i.e., commit adultery), pluck it out!</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tNow, the idea of cutting off a body part to save the rest of the body is not a new one.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>We do this routinely with cancer.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>To stop the spread of cancer to the rest of the body, it&rsquo;s sometimes necessary to cut out the cancerous parts to save the rest of our body.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>From this perspective, what Jesus is saying makes perfect sense.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>If totally removing sin from our life was as &ldquo;simple&rdquo; as cutting off a hand, who wouldn&rsquo;t do that?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tUnfortunately, our sin is not concentrated in a single extremity.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Our problem goes much deeper.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Our sin pervades our entire being, and that was Jesus&rsquo; point.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Jeremiah 17:9 says, &ldquo;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">The heart is more deceitful than all else, And is desperately sick; Who can understand it</i>?&rdquo;<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>David says, &ldquo;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:normal\">Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me</i>.&rdquo; (Psalm 51:5)<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Romans 3 says, &ldquo;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">10 as it is written, &ldquo;There is none righteous, not even one; 11 There is none who understands, There is none who seeks for God; 12 All have turned aside, together they have become useless; There is none who does good, There is not even one</i>.&rdquo;<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>A person who realizes this is poor in spirit, indeed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tOur sin is not caused by our extremities or a single body part, and plucking out our eye or cutting off our hand won&rsquo;t have any effect on keeping us from sinning.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Like the person whose cancer has spread beyond a single body part, our entire body is infected with sin.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>The only way to get rid of it is to kill the body completely.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Our old man must die.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>We must, as Jesus told Nicodemus, be born again, from above.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tThat is exactly what God does for us when He saves us.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Just as we were completely dependent on God for our physical birth, we are also dependent on Him for our spiritual birth.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>As part of this birth, we also died.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Galatians 2 explains:</p>\n<h5 class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t&ldquo;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">19 For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I might live to God.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>20 I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me</i>.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t<br />\n\tLikewise, Romans 7:</p>\n<h5 class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t&ldquo;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">4 Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>5 For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>6 But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter</i>.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tOn the one hand, these passages are clear and understandable; on the other, I still struggle to comprehend what it means that it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>The reason I find it difficult to understand, I think, is because although I have been crucified with Christ, I still sin.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>I don&rsquo;t want to sin, but I still do.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>Thankfully, Paul deals with this very issue in Romans 7:</p>\n<h5 class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t&ldquo;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">15 For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>16 But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with the Law, confessing that the Law is good.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>17 So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>19 For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>20 But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>21 I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good. <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span>22 For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man, 23 but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members. <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span>24 Wretched man that I am! <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span>Who will set me free from the body of this death? <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span>25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord</i>!&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tThis is a lifelong struggle for us as believers.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span>We carry around a body of death, full of sin, and this body wars against the Spirit who lives and dwells in us.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp; </span></p>\n<h5 class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t&ldquo;<i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style:\nnormal\">16 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span>17 For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. <span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span>18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law</i>.&rdquo; (Galatians 5)<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;</span><br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tOur goal is to be led by the Spirit that we may walk in the Spirit.<span style=\"mso-spacerun:yes\">&nbsp;

                 "body": "<p style=\"\">\n\t<em>Pastor Armstrong beat me to the punch today with his excellent post concerning the Presidential Election. While I was sleeping on the article below for fear that its tone was perhaps too harsh, he was seizing the day. We have the same message from different approaches, which is sometimes helpful to those of us who operate from the other side of the brain, so I hope you&rsquo;ll pardon the redundancy while I beat a half-dead dead horse.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>\n\tSo my husband was in Vegas recently for a conference. While he was there he took great joy in sending us photos of all the decadent food he was eating. I&#39;m not sure why since it was nothing short of torment for us. Maybe that was why.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of the food on the buffet line was identified with little signs so you wouldn&rsquo;t confuse the catfish with the chicken strips (have mercy!!) and so that you were aware of any potential allergens. One day he found this little sign in front of a bowl. It read:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \">\n\tWalnuts<br />\n\tContains nuts</p>\n<p>\n\tYeah. That&rsquo;s what he thought. It just is what it is, right?</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThe world has a buffet line of gods from which to choose. For the unbeliever, your God is just one among many and you, Christian, are the little sign in front of Him. People want to know what they&rsquo;re getting before they choose and they&rsquo;re looking to you to make that clear. So, as the Presidential Election (finally!) comes to a conclusion this week, ask yourself what you&rsquo;re advertising about your God.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou claim to be a follower of an almighty, sovereign God who created the universe, holds it in His hand and keeps it spinning. You claim to believe in a God who neither slumbers nor sleeps, who has purposed good things for His people, whose son died to give you hope. You claim to believe in the One who was and is and is to come, and yet you despair, publicly, while the world is watching, and what you reveal is a god who is altogether different from the One you claim to serve. One who is not entirely trustworthy. One who is not wholly powerful. One who is asleep at the wheel &ndash; or worse &ndash; is capricious. One who has abandoned His people to hopelessness.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we are not a people without hope! We have a Hope that does not disappoint! Where the election is concerned, we prayed, we fasted, and we voted our conscience. But God ultimately had a different plan (assuming you voted for the guy who lost.) God has His own plans and they don&rsquo;t always look like ours. Will we trust Him anyway? Or are we offended because He didn&rsquo;t follow our plan? (Surely we are wiser than God, right?)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tMaybe it&rsquo;s time to reexamine the contents of your bowl. Maybe until now you haven&rsquo;t really stopped to scrutinize the ingredients, and this election has served a valuable purpose (if you choose to let it) in revealing a lot of filler and imitation flavor in your faith. It&rsquo;s easy to proclaim the wonders of God in the good times, but what about when He disappoints you? When you chew that up and swallow it, is it the same God you believed in before things got hard? Or do you have a god of your own making, from whom you expect obedience, and by whom you feel betrayed?</p>\n<p>\n\tHard times will come. The world will crumble around us (have you read the end of the Book?!). These things should not take us by surprise! At the end of the day, when the world considers the God we&rsquo;re offering, the sign of our lives should read:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \">\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;God<br />\n\tUnshakable, unsearchable, unchangeable<br />\n\tFrom everlasting to everlasting<br />\n\tOur Blessed Hope<br />\n\tOur Savior, Redeemer and Friend<br />\n\tOur Sovereign Lord and Master<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The One in whom we trust<br />\n\t&nbsp; Forever</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Post Script</strong> &ndash; <em>I&rsquo;ve found reading through Judges and 1st Kings to be extraordinarily helpful recently. These dark books we tend to avoid have helped me understand that:<br />\n\t1. God works through all kinds of people to accomplish His purposes.<br />\n\t2. His reason for allowing moral decay is ultimately to drive His wayward people back to Him. (He excels at saving people from themselves!)<br />\n\t3. God will not rob ANY man of his own will, but will continue to work through the circumstances to bring Himself glory.</em></p>\n<p style=\"\">\n\t<em>Even though &ldquo;my&rdquo; candidate did not win this election, I am eager to see what God intends. And I feel an urgent need to be &ldquo;ready&rdquo;. The world may need us, fellow Christian, to hold out a Hope they have not yet considered &ndash; do we have One to offer? One who is what He is?</em></p>\n<p style=\"\">\n\t<em>I believe God has already used this to reveal something to His people. I believe that our collective despair reveals a dangerously shallow and misguided &ldquo;faith&rdquo;. One that will not stand when tested. One that has, indeed, not stood <strong>this</strong> test. I believe that we need to be seeking God&rsquo;s face (to use a trite Christian clich&eacute;) about our personal spiritual conditions. From brokenness, we can build (read Ezra and Nehemiah for inspiration and instruction). So if you find yourself convicted because your faith faltered and you now realize that the god you have believed in has, in part, been a god of your own making, take heart! And get busy rebuilding on the foundation of the Word of Truth! Time&rsquo;s a wastin&rsquo;.</em></p>\n"

It seems like only yesterday. It was the day that the Lord taught me the meaning of the word \"abide\".</p>\n\n<p>My daughter was five years old and we had recently moved into a new house. She was frightened about being alone in her room. It was strange, new place and she needed the comfort of her father&#39;s presence&hellip; my presence. Fatherhood is a mystery and an unfathomable joy that continues to unfold each and every day but there is something especially unique about the relationship between a little girl and her daddy. (No tears gentlemen. I have discovered keyboards aren&#39;t waterproof.)</p>\n\n<p>Although I was exhausted from the move, my daughter&#39;s cry had pierced the fog of fatigue. Unlike other nights, she wasn&#39;t trying to wheedle a few extra minutes of playtime with requests for water, hugs, or a bedtime story. She simply needed me to be there. Nothing less than my presence would allow her to feel secure so she could fall asleep.</p>\n\n<p>Afterward, as I was walking to my room, the Lord pressed upon my heart His words:</p>\n\n<h5>Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. (John 15:4)</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After these words, some questions came to mind:</p>\n\n<p>\"Is My presence essential to your day?<br />\nDo you seek Me and cry out for Me each and every day?<br />\nDo you need <strong>My</strong> presence as much as your daughter needed yours?\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I wept. But this time it was with shame. I had become so preoccupied with the move, my job, my life that I had failed to seek my Father&#39;s presence. And in that simple, joyful moment with my daughter, G-d showed me a picture of how I should cry out to Him, \"Father, don&#39;t leave! Abide with me!\"</p>\n\n<p>Merriam-Webster&#39;s Word of the Day for October 21st was abide and it brought to mind that beautiful, poignant moment with my daughter from a decade ago. It also brought to mind a beautiful 19th century hymn that puts the cry and desire for G-d&#39;s abiding presence into song:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abide with Me</strong><br />\n<br />\nAbide with me; fast falls the eventide;<br />\nthe darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.<br />\nWhen other helpers fail and comforts flee,<br />\nHelp of the helpless, O abide with me.<br />\n<br />\nSwift to its close ebbs out life&#39;s little day;<br />\nearth&#39;s joys grow dim; its glories pass away;<br />\nchange and decay in all around I see;<br />\nO thou who changest not, abide with me.<br />\n<br />\nI need thy presence every passing hour.<br />\nWhat but thy grace can foil the tempter&#39;s power?<br />\nWho, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?<br />\nThrough cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.<br />\n<br />\nI fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless;<br />\nills have no weight, and tears not bitterness.<br />\nWhere is death&#39;s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?<br />\nI triumph still, if thou abide with me.<br />\n<br />\nHold thou thy cross before my closing eyes;<br />\nshine through the gloom and point me to the skies.<br />\nHeaven&#39;s morning breaks, and earth&#39;s vain shadows flee;<br />\nin life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>May that be our cry today to our Heavenly Father: <em>in life, in death, O Lord, abide with me</em>.</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s a long drive to the grocery store from my house. Yes, I live in the land of the Walmart Home Office and World Headquarters, but the closest Wally to my house is 6 miles away. I know. It&rsquo;s inexplicable. Not only is it a long drive, it&rsquo;s one of those stop-and-go varieties that&rsquo;s enough to make you lose your mind before it&rsquo;s over, and then you remember that you have to turn around and do it all again. Sigh.</p>\n<p>\n\tDo you all remember a while back I talked about <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/off_the_leash/\"><strong>being mastered</strong></a>?&nbsp;Well, part of learning to surrender to the true and proper Master involves repentance. I always thought repentance was something you did once and for all. Like resolving to never, ever, ever again eat a Double Stuffed Oreo cookie&hellip;and really not ever, ever doing it again. (Can you imagine?) But what I&rsquo;m discovering in this journey toward being surrendered to the Lord is that repentance is like that trip to &ndash; and from &ndash; the grocery store. It&rsquo;s a long road that requires frequent stops and lane changes as you slug your way toward the destination. Sometimes when you find yourself finally&hellip;<em><strong>finally</strong></em>&hellip;where you were headed, you realize that you left your list at home and you have to turn around and trudge back the way you came and start again.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis walk (or drive &ndash; it seems to be a continuing theme) with Jesus just keeps getting more perplexing, more fluid, less check-it-off-your-list-ish, less controllable, less about me. I find myself at a loss for words of wisdom for you. For myself. For anyone. And I find myself more and more in constant conversation with this Master who would rule me in the unique way that is individual to my particular brand of crazy. We may all be on the same road headed in generally the same direction, but we&rsquo;re driving in different vehicles of various states of disrepair as drivers in various states of distraction. You may make some green lights&hellip;running right past caution to an open road ahead&hellip; while I have to slow down and stop. I may have to turn around on this particular trip while you&rsquo;re already in the checkout lane with the People of Walmart. It just isn&rsquo;t the same for each of us.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;What on earth is she rambling on about?&rdquo; you may be asking yourself. In my desire to have my \"stomach\" Mastered, the long repentance is like this. I&rsquo;ve eaten a piece of toast with peanut butter for breakfast. I&rsquo;ve made it to lunch without a snack that my body does not need. I had a healthy salad for lunch and feel quite satisfied. I&rsquo;m hungry before dinner. I want a snack. I head to the pantry without thinking. Stop light. I hear the Lord say, &ldquo;Melissa. Do you really need that? How about a tall glass of water?&rdquo; Yes, Lord. Dinner comes and I enjoy a full meal. I am content. And yet&hellip;I find myself standing in front of the pantry door again. Stop light. I hear the Lord say, &ldquo;Melissa. Is your stomach your god that you must obey it? Is your imagined appetite ruling you? Will you surrender to it, answering its demands, or will you trust that my grace is sufficient for you?&rdquo; Sometimes it goes like this, &ldquo;Girl!? Are you gonna die if you don&rsquo;t eat 10 minutes before bedtime? I didn&rsquo;t think so. Go wash your face!&rdquo;&nbsp;This is my version of the long repentance. And it goes on every day. Day after day. Sometimes moment by moment. And it&rsquo;s hard. So hard that sometimes I find myself on Pinterest for much longer than is proper or balanced just to get from one meal to the next. That too will have to be Mastered, but He is kind in the offering. For now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tHonestly, sometimes I don&rsquo;t even hear Him honking His horn and I blow right through the red light in my clueless determination to make it to those pretzels. (And then I get middle-of-the-night heartburn repentance!!) Sometimes I just run the red light because I darn-well choose to. Sometimes we stand at the pantry door for long minutes discussing the issue, me defending and negotiating, He listening and nodding. I am free to choose. I am free to enjoy what is necesarry and balanced. And I am free to repent from what is not. Again. In shame. In weakness. In grace. In loving kindness. In the growing awareness of how very needy I am for His&hellip;everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to tell you, though, that I have seen the rewards of stop-light repentance, and of being mastered by Truth and Love. I&rsquo;ve lost 20 lbs. since <em><strong>deciding </strong></em>that I would not be ruled by my stomach. (All glory to God!) I emphasize <em><strong>deciding </strong></em>because of its utter foolish pride fullness as if I could somehow even understand the sin of my behavior if He had not shown it to me. I have been humbled in this&hellip;endeavor&hellip;like I have never been before.&nbsp; Frankly, even as I write this my face is burning with the humiliation of the things my gentle Master has revealed to me, and even more from the things I know remain hidden; I&rsquo;m am far more foolish and deceived than even I can believe until He shows me. And I tremble, lest you should ask me for my diet plan. That is too small a request. It is an adventure in missing the point. There is no formula for being mastered except to say that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points.&nbsp; Being mastered is not a plan&hellip;it is brokenness. It is a hobbling repentance that stops and starts and stops and starts again under the direction of the Master who knows you. It never ends. There is no finish line as long as you draw breath. There are no check-lists. You don&rsquo;t get to proclaim the thing done. You simply learn to live on the road of the long repentance, which will, eventually, bring you home.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe greater part of me wants to leave you with that last thought, but it is not the last word on this subject because there is JOY unimagined when you recognize your shackles and ask the Lord to show you how to live free of them. I didn&rsquo;t say it was a pleasure. I said there is JOY. That is entirely different.&nbsp; Imperatively different. Eternally different. I have begun asking the Lord to Master my mouth, and I can tell you without hesitation, that I can&rsquo;t even get out of my driveway on this one. It seems an impossible journey, and it&rsquo;s gonna be rough on my brakes! But I have seen and tasted that He is good, and I have a craving for His voice and a hunger to experience His presence and the joy of His provision. And so&hellip;&rdquo;<em>I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me</em>&rdquo;. (Philippians 3:12b)</p>\n<p>\n\tSo...I&#39;ll see you at the stoplights? (In my head I&#39;m hearing, \"Smile and wave boys. Smile and wave.\" Extra points if you understand that!)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;&hellip;f<em>or I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance. I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now &hellip; Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</em>&rdquo; Phil. 1:19-21a.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>The other day my son texted me after one of his late-afternoon college classes:</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><strong>Power went out at home.&nbsp; How do I reconnect Netflix on the TV?</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I responded:</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\"><strong>Wrapping up at work now.&nbsp; Will fix it when I get home.&nbsp; 20 minutes.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Traffic was light and I got home quickly.&nbsp; My wife was running errands and wasn&#39;t home yet but my son&#39;s car was in its normal spot.&nbsp; As I walked into the house, however, things seemed anything but normal.</p>\n\n<p>The shades were still drawn and the house was dark.&nbsp; School papers were scattered all over the kitchen.&nbsp; A cup, rolling slightly on its side, was empty on the counter; its contents dripping onto the tile floor in a syncopated rhythm to the ticking of the kitchen clock.&nbsp; The appliances in the kitchen mindlessly flashed their repetitive message: 12:42... 12:42... 12:42.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tick</strong>... <span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">drip</span>-blink.&nbsp; <strong>Tick</strong>-blink... <span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">drip</span>.&nbsp; Blink-<strong>tick</strong>... <span style=\"font-family: courier new,courier;\">drip</span>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I called out to my son, &ldquo;Nathan!&nbsp; Where are you?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>No answer.</p>\n\n<p>Concerned, I called out for my daughter.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Something wasn&#39;t right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I dropped my bags and headed upstairs.&nbsp; I called out to the kids again: no response.&nbsp; Everything upstairs seemed normal except for the clocks demanding attention with their monotonous 12:42 message... and no kids.&nbsp; <em>What happened during my 20 minute drive home?!</em></p>\n\n<p>I began searching room by room... and found my son lying on the floor of his bedroom.</p>\n\n<p>Asleep with his ear buds in; music still playing.</p>\n\n<p>I breathed a sigh of relief and woke him up.&nbsp; It turns out the cat had scattered his papers on the island after knocking over the cup (the paw-print evidence found later was overwhelming and the defendant was found guilty as charged).&nbsp; My daughter had a late band practice that afternoon and wasn&#39;t home yet.</p>\n\n<p>As a parent, I tend to worry about my kids and my overactive imagination doesn&#39;t help.&nbsp; My mom tells me that she still worries about me even though I am over forty.&nbsp; The great Christian orator Charles Spurgeon once said, \"It is the nature of children to imitate their parents.\"&nbsp; Apparently that applies to worrying as well.</p>\n\n<p>When something is amiss, I feel a need to immediately connect with my wife and kids: a call, a text message, or a quick shout upstairs... whatever it takes.&nbsp; Apparently our cat feels the same way.&nbsp; As soon as he comes in through his pet door, the little fur ball immediately begins yowling to connect with the family and let everyone know he is home and safe.</p>\n\n<p>I digress.</p>\n\n<p>My point is this: when things are out of whack in life, I want to reach out and connect with my loved ones.&nbsp; Knowing they are safe and sound provides a measure of comfort and stability in the midst of whatever situation arises.</p>\n\n<p>I realized recently that there was one person who I was not connecting with as quickly or as often as everyone else: G-d.&nbsp; In my defense, I must say that I don&#39;t have G-d&#39;s cell number so texting and phone calls are not an option.&nbsp; Maybe I should just give Him a quick shout \"upstairs\"?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah... I know.&nbsp; G-d is everywhere, right?&nbsp; King David makes that plain:</p>\n\n<h5><em>Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? If I ascend to heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, even there Your hand will lead me, And Your right hand will lay hold of me. If I say, \"Surely the darkness will overwhelm me, and the light around me will be night,\" Even the darkness is not dark to You, and the night is as bright as the day. Darkness and light are alike to You.&nbsp;</em> (Psalm 139:7-12)</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the thing: although I <strong>know</strong> He is present everywhere I don&#39;t always <strong>feel</strong> it.&nbsp; Instead of sensing that something is out of whack and crying out to G-d \"where are You?&nbsp; I need your help and comfort!\", I tend to let it go and try to handle it on my own.&nbsp; Life is busy, you know?&nbsp; I&#39;m responsible for taking care of my wife, my kids, and my job.&nbsp; I figure G-d&#39;s got everything under control and doesn&#39;t need me interrupting, right?</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Wrong!&nbsp; That&#39;s not the point.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Messiah tells us, \"I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.\"&nbsp; (John 15:5)</p>\n\n<p>Paul says that in Christ \"we live and move and have our being\" (Acts 17:28) and that we are \"created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which G-d prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them\" (Ephesians 2:10).</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of <em>how </em>I feel... regardless of <em>what</em> I feel... only G-d knows what He has created me to <strong>do</strong> and <strong>be</strong> today.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m responsible for my wife.&nbsp; G-d knows what He created me to <strong>do</strong> and <strong>be</strong> for my wife today.<br />\nI&#39;m responsible for my kids.&nbsp; G-d knows what He created me to <strong>do</strong> and <strong>be</strong> for my kids today.<br />\nI&#39;m responsible for my job.&nbsp; &nbsp; G-d knows what He... You get the point.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So maybe we should be in the regular habit of going before our Creator and \"checking in\", so to speak.&nbsp; During the worst of times, we almost <strong>have to</strong> cry out to Him in our distress.&nbsp; But what about the good times and the average times?&nbsp; What about those \"dry spells\" where things aren&#39;t that great but they aren&#39;t particularly bad... and you just don&#39;t feel near to the Lord?&nbsp; I believe those are the most important times to be in regular prayer and drawing near to G-d: prayer draws us away from sin that may lead to the \"bad times\" and can propel us towards those precious \"mountain peak\" moments with Him.&nbsp; Unfortunately, absent a particular need or problem, most people find it difficult to pray on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, really... it&#39;s not like I&#39;m keeping G-d up to date on recent events.&nbsp; He already knows everything!&nbsp; It&#39;s not like I have to explain anything to Him.&nbsp; He&#39;s already got it figured out.</p>\n\n<p>When things aren&#39;t particularly good or bad in my life, <strong>why should I pray</strong>?&nbsp; To glorify G-d.</p>\n\n<h5><em>Bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone who is called by My name, and <strong>whom I have created for My glory</strong>, whom I have formed, even whom I have made.</em>&nbsp; (Isaiah 43:7)</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I used to struggle with prayer during the \"dry spells\". I would pray something like, \"Dear Lord.&nbsp; Thank you for this day.&nbsp; Thank you for my wife.&nbsp; Thank you for my kids.&nbsp; Thank you for my job.&nbsp; Thank you for... uhm... everything.&nbsp; Amen.\"</p>\n\n<p>While having a thankful heart is good, I realize that I am not the best at coming up with words for glorifying and praising G-d but I know who is.&nbsp; G-d!&nbsp; The Psalms are recorded for us because they are G-d&#39;s inspired words of praise.&nbsp; The Psalms set my mind right and help me glorify G-d at the same time.</p>\n\n<h5><em>O LORD, our Lord, How majestic is Your name in all the earth, Who have displayed Your splendor above the heavens!</em>&nbsp; (Psalm 8:1)</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><em>The heavens are telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His hands</em>. (Psalm 19:1)</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><em>Lift up your heads, O gates, And be lifted up, O ancient doors, That the King of glory may come in!</em>&nbsp; (Psalm 24:7)</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I was amazed at what happened when I prayed the Psalms.&nbsp; No matter what the day, no matter what the circumstances, I had a minute of peace and joy because I was reminded of <em><strong>Who He is</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>Take five minutes.&nbsp; Find a quiet place.&nbsp; Pick a Psalm.&nbsp; Read it aloud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Connect with the One you love.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s what you were created to do.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tYears ago I was asked to pastor a small church. At the time, the suggestion caught me off guard. I never planned to be a pastor, and I lacked formal training. After some thought and prayer, I agreed to answer the call, because I wanted to serve the Lord anyway He desired.</p>\n<p>\n\tOver the years, I&#39;ve experienced the rewards of pastoral service, including the joy of teaching God&#39;s word and encouraging the faithful in the upward call of Christ. More often, I&#39;ve known the challenging, time-consuming, and emotionally-draining task of shepherding God&#39;s people. Discouragement comes easliy in this line of work, and many pastors are tempted to abandon their vocation.</p>\n<p>\n\tI, too, experience periods of discouragement and doubt, leading me on occasion to question my commitment to pastoring. When the temptation to quit grows strong, I return to a favorite part of scripture meant to encourage pastors like me to hold the course.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe passages are found in two letters Paul wrote to Timothy. Timothy was Paul&#39;s protege. He was young, inexperienced, and challenged by the difficulties of leading a church in a large, pagan city (Ephesus). Reading between the lines in Paul&#39;s letters, we can tell that Timothy often experienced self-doubt about his work as a pastor, even to the point of second-guessing his call to pastoral ministry.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Paul wrote to bolster Timothy&#39;s faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Tim. 4:12&nbsp; Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who believe.<br />\n\t1Tim. 4:13&nbsp; Until I come, give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching.<br />\n\t1Tim. 4:14 &nbsp;Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was bestowed on you through&nbsp; prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery.<br />\n\t1Tim. 4:15 &nbsp;Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that your progress will be evident to all.<br />\n\t1Tim. 4:16&nbsp; Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAnd again:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Tim. 6:13&nbsp; I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of&nbsp; Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,<br />\n\t1Tim. 6:14 that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tAnd again:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Tim. 1:5&nbsp; For I am mindful of the&nbsp; sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and&nbsp; your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well.<br />\n\t2Tim. 1:6 For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.<br />\n\t2Tim. 1:7 For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.<br />\n\t2Tim. 1:8 Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in&nbsp; suffering for the&nbsp; gospel according to the power of God,<br />\n\t2Tim. 1:9 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in&nbsp; Christ Jesus from all eternity,</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tAnd finally:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Tim. 1:15&nbsp; You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.<br />\n\t2Tim. 1:16 &nbsp;The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and&nbsp; was not ashamed of my chains;<br />\n\t2Tim. 1:17 &nbsp;but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me &mdash;<br />\n\t2Tim. 1:18 &nbsp;the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day &mdash; and you know very well what services he rendered at&nbsp; Ephesus.<br />\n\t2Tim. 2:1&nbsp; You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tDid you notice Paul&#39;s progression? Each of these passages moves the conversation steadily toward Paul&#39;s final point found in the opening of 2Tim 2. Paul is concerned that Timothy would give up the fight to deliver the gospel and train the church in the word of God. He continually admonished Timothy to \"keep the commandment\" and \"kindle afresh the gift of God\" and \"join me in suffering for the gospel\" and \"be strong in the grace that is Christ.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, the final passage above includes mention of some workers that had turned away from Paul, and Paul looked down upon these men for their unwillingness to stay the course of ministry in the face of hardship. Clearly, Paul is leading Timothy to understand that he should not turn away from the calling and gifting God has given to Timothy to preach the gospel.</p>\n<p>\n\tThus we come to 2Tim 2:2-6:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Tim. 2:2 &nbsp;The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.<br />\n\t2Tim. 2:3&nbsp; Suffer hardship with me, as a good&nbsp; soldier of&nbsp; Christ Jesus.<br />\n\t2Tim. 2:4 &nbsp;No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.<br />\n\t2Tim. 2:5 &nbsp;Also if anyone&nbsp; competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.<br />\n\t2Tim. 2:6&nbsp; The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tPaul uses three analogies to impress upon Timothy three different perspectives on ministry. First, Paul says that that a minister of the Gospel is like a soldier called for duty. A soldier sets aside the world and all it holds, and does not concern himself with the affairs of everyday life. His mission is too important, so it demands his full attention lest he fail at his duties. A soldier must become 100% committed to the mission and his role.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, a minister of the gospel must see his call as a life changing, permanent refocusing of his time and passions. Such a man is set apart by God for the purpose of preaching the Gospel. As pastors, we must purposely set aside any unhealthy interest in the world and the distractions it offers, like a soldier who is too absorbed in the mission to allow routine life to intrude.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, Paul compares a minister to an athlete. An athlete understands that the only sensible reason to join a competition is to receive the reward, and the reward only comes to those who compete well, follow the rules and complete the race. If we don&#39;t give our best, we cannot succeed. If we don&#39;t compete properly, we will be disqualified. If we quit before the competition is over, we forfeit the chance to win.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, someone who begins to pastor must understand that the prize for our service to Christ will only come if we give our best to the effort, minister properly according to the word of God, and persevere to the end of our lives. As Paul says in Romans 10, the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable, so the length of our race is defined as the length of our earthly life. Nothing less will suffice.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, Paul uses the analogy of a farmer. A farmer&#39;s role is to prepare the field, sow seed and produce a harvest. Once the harvest arrives, the farmer receives his reward. His reward is a portion of what has been sown, but this provision is entirely dependent on a successful harvest. Were the farmer to give up on his farming before the harvest arrived, he would be left with nothing to show for his efforts. If he perseveres, however, he will be the first to receive a share of the bounty.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, ministering is a long, difficult process. The fruit of our work will not come immediately, and we may not gain a full understanding of what we achieved until our judgment moment, where our works are evaluated for eternity. Should we labor for five, ten or even twenty years in ministry only to give up before the harvest is complete, we&#39;re like the farmer who abandons his field halfway through the growing season. We forfeit our prize and abandon our reward.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, if we persevere we should expect to receive the choicest rewards, just as the farmer selects from the best of the harvest.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are a pastor (or other devoted minister) contemplating ending your ministry, I encourage you to first consider this question. Were you called and gifted by God for this ministry? If you <em>didn&#39;t</em> receive such a call,&nbsp;then you <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be pastoring in the first place. Pastoral ministry is simply too demanding to sustain for a lifetime without a clear calling and gifting from God.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we pastor under any other pretense, our efforts are likely to end badly, both for us and those we pastor. Many men have attempted to pastor without such a calling, and they usually bring shame to Christ in the end.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, if God <em>called</em> you to pastoral ministry, then you have <em>no choice</em> but to persevere, for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. The call to pastor sets men&nbsp;apart from other Christians for the sake of the Gospel, and the Lord&#39;s expectations are very high for those He calls.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn light of the importance of pastoral ministry, we should expect the enemy to sow seeds of doubt in our minds and to bring temptations for us to quit, just as he did for Timothy. Stand up to these temptations and distractions by remembering Paul&#39;s words.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my experience, men who receive a call to pastoral ministry were rarely seeking such a call when it came. In fact, many would-be pastors ignore their calling for a time and questioning their suitability for the role before eventually embracing it. In the end, God chooses who He wants. Remember Jesus&#39; words:</p>\n<h5>\n\tJohn 6:70 Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Did I Myself not choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is&nbsp; a devil?&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tSo the question is...have you been called and gifted by God to pastoral ministry or not? I know my answer. As Paul says in 2Tim 2:7:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Tim. 2:7 Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t(Personal note... I&#39;ve hit a very dry spell in my writing lately, so I hope you all will bear with me and Jesus while we take a hiatus and I post a bunch of leftovers from when I was keeping a blog. They may be a bit different from my usual fare but we&#39;ll see what the Lord wants to accomplish here if you&#39;re willing. Here goes...)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;I was reminded this morning of a funny episode from when my son was little. I was still working at the time so he must been about two. He went to a sitter while I worked. She was the best, but she was also a little eccentric. Sometimes Wil would come home with what we began calling Norma-isms. One day I noticed that he would suddenly stop what he was doing, jerk the back of his hand up to his mouth and make a &ldquo;whoot&rdquo; sound. (It&rsquo;s so much better to see than to explain.) I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what he was doing, so I began to watch for the trigger and noticed that he was directing the action at us after a while, usually because of something he didn&rsquo;t like.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne afternoon I got to Norma&rsquo;s a little early and stood at the kitchen window watching her interact with the kids while they played in the yard. She had her back to me. Wil was skidding around on the big wheel like Mario Andretti and when he got too carried away and tried to take out a spectator on one turn, Norma raised her hand to her mouth and I heard a &ldquo;whoot&rdquo;. She had a whistle in her hand. She was calling an &ldquo;infraction&rdquo;. Wil stopped in his tracks, made a correction to his behavior and went on his way. It was truly amazing. (Norma taught me everything I know about parenting, so if you think my kid is cool&hellip;you can thank her, not me!)</p>\n<p>\n\tWe still &ldquo;give the whistle&rdquo; to each other in my house when someone gets too carried away with something. It&rsquo;s still effective, even though it&rsquo;s all in fun. This morning, though, as my son and my husband horsed around and one of them got the whistle, I thought about how often I have prayed for God&rsquo;s voice to be louder than any other voice in my life&hellip;and how it&rsquo;s just not. I wish God would give me the whistle. I wish, when I begin to get a little carried away with myself, that He would stop me in my tracks and make the world pause long enough for me to shift my attitude before I resume activity. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m left to self-moderate, like little Wil (And he was better at it than I am!). Sometimes I need to throw my own hand up -usually to cover my big fat mouth- and give myself a little &ldquo;whoot&rdquo;, even if it&rsquo;s under my breath.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if you see me pulling a Norma one day, you can just smile and know that I&rsquo;m attempting to self-moderate&hellip;because as I think about it, I did hear that still small &ldquo;whoot&rdquo; of the Holy Spirit, and He&rsquo;s giving me the opportunity to stop my big wheel before I do serious damage to myself or others. Now if I can just get the brakes on this thing to work&hellip; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n"

Bill Nye gained fame through an educational show he hosted on PBS (Public Broadcasting System) from 1993 to 1998.&nbsp; He said that people who deny evolution and teach those views to children harms them, and even hampers scientific progress.&nbsp; He went on to say, &ldquo;Evolution is the fundamental idea in all of life science, in all of biology.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s very much analogous to trying to do geology without believing in tectonic plates.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re just not going to get the right answer.&nbsp; Your whole world is just going to be a mystery instead of an exciting place.&nbsp; And I say to the grownups, if you want to deny evolution and live in your world, in your world that&rsquo;s completely inconsistent with everything we observe in the universe, that&rsquo;s fine, but don&rsquo;t make your kids do it because we need them.&nbsp; We need scientifically literate voters and taxpayers for the future.&nbsp; We need people that can &mdash; we need engineers that can build stuff, solve problems.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just really a hard thing, it&rsquo;s really a hard thing.&nbsp; You know, in another couple of centuries that world view, I&rsquo;m sure, will be, it just won&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no evidence for it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIf you want to be stupid, Mr. Adult, fine, but please, don&rsquo;t make your children stupid!&nbsp; In fact, you&rsquo;re so stupid that in about two hundred years your world view won&rsquo;t even exist.&nbsp; That pretty much sums up the vast majority of the secular world&rsquo;s view on the origin of the universe and life itself.&nbsp; Knuckle dragging Christians like me, however, tend to have a different view.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are quite a few Christians, for various reasons, who do still believe in evolution.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSome Christians continue to believe evolution because they simply have been told all their life that this is the way it is.&nbsp; They are told that this is proven scientific fact beyond the shadow of a doubt and are never told about the inconsistencies in evolutionary theory.&nbsp; Therefore, they believe it&rsquo;s true.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tChristians who believe evolution and study God&rsquo;s word soon realize they have a problem.&nbsp; The best friend evolution has is time (because it takes billions and billions of years for evolution to work), so the earth is many billion years old (no one knows how old for sure, but there&rsquo;s plenty of guesses, er, \"factual\" statements as to the earth&rsquo;s age (sorry, my knuckles were dragging again; I must not have fully evolved yet).&nbsp; The Bible student then reads Genesis, which states that God created everything in six days.&nbsp; Uh-oh!&nbsp; Now what to do?!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThis is where it gets kind of interesting.&nbsp; Many Christians, not wanting to look &ldquo;unsophisticated or unscientific&rdquo; have developed explanations that try to fit Genesis into the theory of evolution.&nbsp; For example, since God does not make the sun and moon until the fourth day, some Christians theorize that the first three days were not literal days, which allows for billions and billions of years and, <em>voila!</em>, now the Bible agrees with evolution and we no longer have to drag our knuckles on the ground!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; We can now stand up straight and join the Bill Nye&rsquo;s of the world and be scientifically literate, build stuff, and not worry that our world view will no longer be around in 200 years.&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to climb down out of this tree and go sit at my desk and design a bridge, just as soon as the callouses on my knuckles heal!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tUnfortunately, there are some scientists who are Christians (not to be confused with Christian Science) who have promulgated this theory that God works through evolution, that what we read in His word is just an allegory.&nbsp; They call this &ldquo;<strong>theistic evolution</strong>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They believe God made everything, but that He did it through evolution.&nbsp; In other words, Charles Darwin was absolutely right, and we just need to view Scripture through the lens of evolution instead of viewing the world through the lens of Scripture.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThere are two major problems with this theory.&nbsp; First involves science itself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a scientist (remember, my knuckles drag), but there are plenty of scientists who are both believers and unbelievers who deny evolution.&nbsp; So, I think it&rsquo;s useful to list a few of the reasons why evolution doesn&rsquo;t make sense from the evidence itself.&nbsp; Second, and more importantly, is the fact that evolution contradicts Scripture.&nbsp; While there are many things we could discuss about this, we&rsquo;ll limit it to just a few very important issues.&nbsp; In the end, I&rsquo;m hopeful you will agree that a believer simply cannot hold to the truth of Scripture and the truth of evolution; they are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tLet&rsquo;s first consider some problems with evolution from science itself.&nbsp; Evolution teaches that everything came into existence from a spinning dot that exploded (the &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; theory; note, they know not from where this spinning dot came nor how it exploded.&nbsp; They simply believe that something came from nothing, even though science now tells us this is impossible; and they say we only have faith!)&nbsp; If the spinning dot theory is true, then every planet that spins would spin in the same direction.&nbsp; This is known as the &ldquo;law of conservation of angular momentum&rdquo;, which states &ldquo;that when no external torque acts on an object or a closed system of objects, no change of angular momentum can occur.&rdquo;&nbsp; It turns out that all of the planets in our solar system, for example, do turn in the same direction.&nbsp; Except two:&nbsp; Venus and Uranus.&nbsp; But wait, there&rsquo;s more!&nbsp; Six of 63 moons also spin in the opposite direction.&nbsp; This is a problem for the evolutionist.&nbsp; It does not automatically prove evolution false, but it does find fault with the theory&rsquo;s premise of how the universe began (i.e., the spinning dot).&nbsp; Therefore, at a minimum, the evolutionist must either account for these &ldquo;backward spinning&rdquo; planets and moons or change his premise/theory.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe evolutionist would also expect matter to be distributed rather evenly throughout the universe.&nbsp; However, in fact, the universe is rather &ldquo;lumpy&rdquo;.&nbsp; That is, there are clusters of stars and then great voids of nothing.&nbsp; This is a problem for the evolutionist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAnother scientific problem for the evolutionist is that stars die about every 30 years.&nbsp; Yet, there are less than 300 supernovas (dead stars) that we can see.&nbsp; If evolution is true, there should be several hundred million supernovas, but there aren&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tEvolution also teaches that oxygen at one point was not in the atmosphere, but that ammonia was.&nbsp; The problem is that ammonia is destroyed by ultraviolet (UV) light.&nbsp; Furthermore, ozone blocks UV light, but ozone has oxygen.&nbsp; Therefore, ammonia could not have survived prior to the existence of oxygen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThere are also many creatures that don&rsquo;t fit with evolutionary theory.&nbsp; One is the termite.&nbsp; They eat wood, but they cannot digest it.&nbsp; To perform this function, they have little creatures in their stomach that digests the wood.&nbsp; Which came first?&nbsp; And you thought that question only applied to the chicken and the egg.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThere is also no evidence of evolutionary transitions in the fossil record, or that we see in existence today.&nbsp; If evolution is true, there should be a super abundance of evidence of transitional creatures.&nbsp; Since so much time is required to move from one life form to another, how come we don&rsquo;t still see some ape like creatures that are almost human, to name but one life form?&nbsp; This is why evolutionists have been so desperate to find the &ldquo;missing link&rdquo;, but have yet to do so.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tFinally, as a friend once pointed out to me, what did the very first organism eat?&nbsp; Yeah, think about that for a minute.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNow, there are many, many more scientific problems with the theory of evolution that could be mentioned.&nbsp; Again, I am not a scientist, but I just wanted to make Christians aware that objections to evolution are not all centered on evolution&rsquo;s contradictions of Scripture.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWe&rsquo;ll now turn to the more important issue of evolution and Scripture.&nbsp; What motivated me to write this article was a book that a friend loaned to me.&nbsp; The book was written in 2006 by Francis Collins, and it&rsquo;s entitled <em>The Language of God</em>.&nbsp; When I first started reading it, I thought it was a book that demonstrated how science was in harmony with Scripture.&nbsp; Instead, Mr. Collins sought to promote evolution and how it can be in harmony with Scripture.&nbsp; He calls this theistic evolution, as mentioned earlier.&nbsp; Sadly, he is not alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tMr. Collins&rsquo; background is also worth mentioning.&nbsp; He is quite an impressive scientist, a leading geneticist and was head of the Human Genome project.&nbsp; Mr. Collins is part of a larger organization he founded called BioLogos.&nbsp; Their own description states, &ldquo;BioLogos is a community of evangelical Christians committed to exploring and celebrating the compatibility of evolutionary creation and biblical faith, guided by the truth that &ldquo;all things hold together in Christ.&rdquo; [Col 1:17].&rdquo;&nbsp; He and BioLogos are endorsed by quite a few pastors, including Tim Keller, pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, and Os Guinness, a famous Christian author.&nbsp; My point here is that Mr. Collins is a serious scientist, and that there are quite a few well known and not so well known Christians who are in agreement with Mr. Collins&rsquo; (and BioLogos) views.&nbsp; The question we want to ask is, are their views in agreement with Scripture?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tFirst and foremost, Mr. Collins seeks to call into question whether or not Genesis 1 and 2, the creation story, is literal.&nbsp; Throughout his book, Mr. Collins often quotes C.S. Lewis to justify his position.&nbsp; Apparently, Lewis had bought into the evolution story and made allowances such that it seems he didn&rsquo;t believe Genesis 1 and 2 was literal.&nbsp; Never, though, does he quote the many Christians who view Genesis 1 and 2 as literal.&nbsp; One person that believes evolution does not make it true; it only means C.S. Lewis was wrong.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tMr. Collins goes on to ask whether a non-literal understanding of Genesis 1 and 2 might lead the believer down a &ldquo;slippery slope, ultimately resulting in the denial of the fundamental truths of God and His miraculous actions?&nbsp; While there is clear danger in unrestrained forms of &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; theology that eviscerate the real truths of faith, <strong>mature observers are used to living on slippery slopes and deciding where to place a sensible stopping point</strong>.&nbsp; Many sacred texts do indeed carry the clear marks of eyewitness history, and as believers we must hold fast to those truths.&nbsp; <strong>Others, such as the stories of Job and Jonah, and of Adam and Eve, frankly do not carry that same historical ring</strong>.&nbsp; Given this uncertainty of interpretation of certain scriptural passages, is it sensible for sincere believers to rest the entirety of their position in the evolutionary debate, their views on the trustworthiness of science, and the very foundation of their religious faith on a literalist interpretation, even if other equally sincere believers disagree and have disagreed even long before Darwin and his <em>Origin of Species</em> first appeared&rdquo;&nbsp; (<em>The Language of God</em>, pp. 209-210; emphasis mine)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tI&rsquo;m glad Mr. Collins used the term &ldquo;mature observer&rdquo; as the person who lives on a slippery slope, because mature <strong>believers</strong> are never meant to be on a slippery slope, as we&rsquo;ll see below.&nbsp; Furthermore, it seems that if there are no historical eyewitnesses to certain books of the Bible, then, well, we really can&rsquo;t take them literally.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see if Scripture agrees with Mr. Collins.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWith respect to being on a slippery slope, that is not where God wants His children to be on a regular basis.&nbsp; One of the most famous sermons ever given was &ldquo;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&rdquo; by Jonathan Edwards.&nbsp; His sermon was based on a passage from Deuteronomy 32, which is where, in part, Moses speaks about God and His faithfulness to Israel, and Israel&rsquo;s going astray and how God will punish them for it.&nbsp; Specifically, v. 35 says, &ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Vengeance is Mine, and retribution, In due time their foot will slip; For the day of their calamity is near, And the impending things are hastening upon them.</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Psalm 17 says, &ldquo;<em>4 As for the deeds of men, by the word of Your lips I have kept from the paths of the violent.&nbsp; 5 My steps have held fast to Your paths.&nbsp; My feet have not slipped</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psalm 18:36 says, &ldquo;<em>You enlarge my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psalm 73 says, &ldquo;1<em>7 Until I came into the sanctuary of God; Then I perceived their end.&nbsp; 18 Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to destruction.&nbsp; 19 How they are destroyed in a moment!&nbsp; They are utterly swept away by sudden terrors</em>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Jeremiah 23 states, &ldquo;<em>Therefore their way will be like slippery paths to them, They will be driven away into the gloom and fall down in it; For I will bring calamity upon them, The year of their punishment,&rdquo; declares the LORD</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThere&rsquo;s more, but I think you can see that it&rsquo;s not a good thing to be on a slippery slope in God&rsquo;s eyes!&nbsp; Instead, Scripture says that God wants us to be set on a solid rock and a level path so that we don&rsquo;t slip:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>He brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay, And He set my feet upon a rock making my footsteps firm</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Psalm 40:2)&nbsp; Psalm 27:11 says, &ldquo;<em>Teach me Your way, O Lord, And lead me in a level path Because of my foes</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isaiah 26:7, &ldquo;<em>The way of the righteous is smooth; O Upright One, make the path of the righteous level.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp; Jeremiah 31:9, &ldquo;<em>With weeping they will come, And by supplication I will lead them; I will make them walk by streams of waters, On a straight path in which they will not stumble; For I am a father to Israel, And Ephraim is My firstborn</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAnd what does it mean to be on solid ground, on a level path?&nbsp; Well, one thing is for sure, we must be able to have confidence in God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; If we take Mr. Collins&rsquo; approach, the obvious question is what parts of the Bible do we take as true and those that are not true?&nbsp; Where does Mr. Collins finally start saying, &ldquo;Oh yes, Genesis 5 and on is literal?&rdquo;&nbsp; How does he know what parts are or are not literal?&nbsp; Just by what C.S. Lewis says?&nbsp; Mr. Collins is on a slippery slope indeed.&nbsp; Thankfully, we have Scripture on our side to help us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tOne of the biggest problems of evolution is that of death.&nbsp; Think about it, for millennia, well before Adam comes on the scene, there has to be death, and a lot of it.&nbsp; Yet, Scripture says that it is sin that brings death (e.g., Genesis 2:17, Romans 6:23).&nbsp; The implication is that everything God made was made to live forever.&nbsp; This is not explicit, but it logically follows that when God told Adam and Eve that if they eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil they would surely die, the implication is that if they did not eat from it, they would not die.&nbsp; Some might say this only referred to spiritual death, which indeed it did.&nbsp; But it must have also referred to physical death, because God makes sure Adam and Eve cannot eat from the tree of life once they have sinned and thereby live forever (Genesis 3:22).&nbsp; Therefore, evolution has the very serious problem of death occurring before sin, which contradicts God&rsquo;s word.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t(As an aside, as far as I am aware, evolution has no answer as to why death exists.&nbsp; For example, if evolution is true, and life can literally come from nothing, why does <em>everything</em> die?&nbsp; Why doesn&rsquo;t at least <em>something</em> live forever?&nbsp; The evolutionist cannot answer this; the Christian can.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tBack to death in Genesis, I suppose Mr. Collins would say, yes but that&rsquo;s not literal.&nbsp; Well, Paul apparently took it literally.&nbsp; We read in Romans 5, &ldquo;<em>12 Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned&mdash; 13 for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Romans 5 says death came through Adam&rsquo;s sin; 1 Timothy 1:15 says that Christ came into the world to save sinners.&nbsp; If death already existed apart from sin, as evolution teaches, then why did Jesus come into the world?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tI suppose I could get cute and say gee, it&rsquo;s too bad that Mr. Collins or some other theistic evolutionist wasn&rsquo;t there to explain to Paul that Genesis 1-3 was not meant to be taken literally.&nbsp; But that would ignore the seriousness of what Mr. Collins implies.&nbsp; Remember, God tells us that all Scripture is God breathed (2 Timothy 3:16), meaning what Moses wrote and what Paul wrote were the very words chosen by God Himself.&nbsp; Does Mr. Collins think that since Genesis 1-3 isn&rsquo;t literal that we have to not take Paul literally in Romans 5 and 1 Timothy?&nbsp; Then do we not take 2 Timothy literally either?&nbsp; Do we ignore Jesus&rsquo; genealogy (e.g., Luke 3)?&nbsp; Yes, this is a slippery slope indeed, and the logical consequence of Mr. Collins&rsquo; view leads to incredible confusion for the believer, who simply won&rsquo;t know what to believe.&nbsp; But God is not a God of confusion but of peace (1 Corinthians 14:33).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tPerhaps Mr. Collins is a &ldquo;red letter&rdquo; Christian, one who only thinks what Jesus said was important (referring to how many Bibles will put Jesus&#39; word in the color red).&nbsp; Remember earlier that Mr. Collins said Jonah had no historic witness, so we can&rsquo;t really take it literally (you know, that whole whale swallowing a man thing; let&rsquo;s get real!).&nbsp; Yet Jesus, the God of all creation, took God&rsquo;s word literally.&nbsp; Matthew 19 says, &ldquo;<em>4 And He answered and said, &ldquo;Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, 5 and said, &lsquo;For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh</em>&rsquo;?&rdquo;&nbsp; Notice Jesus specifically said have you not &ldquo;read&rdquo;, referring to Scripture.&nbsp; Jesus also said this about Jonah:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>9 But He answered and said to them, &ldquo;An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign; and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet; 40 for just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 41 The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment, and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tHmmmmm&hellip;is it possible that the Lord performs miraculous feats in order to call attention to Himself?&nbsp; Do you think maybe this is one of the explanations of Scripture Jesus gave to the disciples on the road to Emmaus?&nbsp; Remember, the Scriptures testify of Him (John 5:39).&nbsp; Is the arm of the Lord too short to cause a whale (or &ldquo;sea monster&rdquo;) to swallow a man and then vomit him up on the beach three days later?&nbsp; If God can create the universe and all life in it, as even Mr. Collins believes, then why is it so hard to believe the story of Jonah?&nbsp; Or of Adam and Eve?&nbsp; If Jesus knew Adam and Eve and Jonah weren&rsquo;t meant to be taken literally, why did He say these things to the scribes and Pharisees?&nbsp; No, Jesus did believe it, so we can rest assured that it&rsquo;s true.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWhat about the six days of creation and rest on the seventh?&nbsp; Why is this an allegory and not literal?&nbsp; David believed the creation story (Psalm 33:6,9), as did Nehemiah (Nehemiah 9:6), Isaiah (Isaiah 45:18), and Paul (Colossians 1:16).&nbsp; Again, all of these men wrote by the Holy Spirit of God.&nbsp; Should we believe Mr. Collins, or Scripture?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tI like what Steve teaches about the creation story.&nbsp; Rather than ask why did God create everything in 6 days, the question is why did He take so long?&nbsp; Clearly, God could have created everything in an instant.&nbsp; Creating in six literal days was done with a purpose.&nbsp; The 6 days of work pointed to man&rsquo;s working for his salvation (six is the number of man), while rest on the seventh day was a picture of Christ&rsquo;s salvation (seven is the number of perfection), in which we work no more, for Christ is our atonement and our righteousness.&nbsp; Furthermore, if the seven day cycle is an allegory, how is it that the entire world works on this cycle?&nbsp; This is a reminder to us of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThere&rsquo;s much more that could be said about how evolution contradicts Scripture, but this article is already longer than normal.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s good that we have Christians, like Mr. Collins, who are not afraid to show how scientific (or any) truth is in agreement with Scripture.&nbsp; Evolution, however, really doesn&rsquo;t pass the scientific truth test; when a so called &ldquo;truth&rdquo; contradicts God&rsquo;s word, it&rsquo;s always best to believe God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s not be carried away with the world&rsquo;s view of creation.&nbsp; Even more, let&rsquo;s be careful to not follow misguided brothers and sisters like Mr. Collins, who believe the world rather than the Creator.&nbsp; Be assured that we can rest in the word of the living God, whose word sanctifies us in the truth (John 17:17).</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tI get the Voice of the Martyrs magazine every month, and it&rsquo;s always humbling to read what my brothers and sisters in Christ go through, the ones who live in lands that are outwardly hostile to Christianity.&nbsp; Sure, it&rsquo;s becoming a more hostile environment for Christians here in America, but it&rsquo;s nothing compared to most other countries.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWhat&rsquo;s even more humbling is that the <strong>fools for Christ</strong> featured this month are believers who have limited knowledge of Scripture, yet they simply can&rsquo;t stop telling others about Jesus.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to share the stories of these extraordinary brothers with you all.&nbsp; As you read this, note how the stories parallel exactly what we were told in the Bible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tFirst is pastor Cong, from Vietnam.&nbsp; The Lord has worked through him to spread the gospel in tribal communities in central Vietnam.&nbsp; This is an example of how God is taking the gospel throughout the earth, &ldquo;<em>For so the Lord has commanded us, &#39;I have placed You as a light for the Gentiles, That You may bring salvation to the end of the earth</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Acts 13:47)&nbsp; Although religious freedom is growing, Vietnam is still communist, and remains hostile to Christianity, especially in rural areas.&nbsp; Pastor Cong has been beaten, arrested, and had his house destroyed, yet he keeps preaching the gospel.&nbsp; He is truly a fool for Christ.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNext is our brother Bounchan Kanthavong from Laos.&nbsp; He also knew little about Scripture, but had a burning desire to keep sharing Christ.&nbsp; He was eventually arrested, had his legs put in stocks and was handcuffed.&nbsp; He went for seven days without food.&nbsp; He had a strong will to live because, in his words, &ldquo;I knew that my life was valuable for God and His ministry.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was locked in solitary confinement, yet all he asked for was a Bible, saying he could not live without a Bible (ouch!; how many of us in America take for granted the numerous Bibles we have at home?).&nbsp; He was assigned to cutting firewood, and at one point was able to sneak away to his house (which was not that far from the rural prison) to get a Bible, which he smuggled back into prison.&nbsp; The guards found the Bible and asked him to read it to them.&nbsp; Those guards were soon replaced.&nbsp; The prison chief told him that his family&rsquo;s faith was so strong that Christianity had spread everywhere.&nbsp; They told him to stop believing, go back home, drink, play, and join the Communist party.&nbsp; Bounchan told the chief to stop worshiping a cement idol, gold or bronze idol.&nbsp; Bounchan said that even in prison, he knew that God was with him, and that what Jesus did on the cross was greater than what he went through in prison.&nbsp; He spent 13 years in prison, and when released, he was warned not to share his faith.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>19 But Peter and John answered and said to them, &ldquo;Whether it is right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge; 20 for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard</em>.&rdquo; (Acts 4)&nbsp; His desire is that we in America share the gospel, since we have the freedom to do so.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAlso serving the Lord in Vietnam is Ly A Pao of the Hmong tribe.&nbsp; God has been using him to spread the gospel and teach believers.&nbsp; For this, he has paid a price:&nbsp; he has been arrested, mocked, and beaten for his faith in Jesus.&nbsp; He has been stripped naked and forced to sleep on a cold concrete floor with no blanket.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s had several teeth knocked out and been thrown down a flight of stairs.&nbsp; Told by a colonel to bow to him, Pao said he would not bow before any man and would only kneel before the Lord, as only He deserves praise and worship.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>29 And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and grant that Your bond-servants may speak Your word with all confidence, 30 while You extend Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of Your holy servant Jesus</em>.&rdquo; (Acts 4)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNext, we have Ma Toa, another Vietnamese pastor.&nbsp; He, too, had no training.&nbsp; All he did was share the gospel, and the Lord brought 100 people to Christ in his first year of ministry.&nbsp; Ma had been a Communist party leader, and he lost his job when the party learned of his conversion to Christ.&nbsp; Being very familiar with the law, Ma has been able to effectively use it against the police when they try to unjustly imprison him.&nbsp; Yet he keeps preaching the gospel.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>25 But when they stretched him out with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, &ldquo;Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?&rdquo; 26 When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and told him, saying, &ldquo;What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman</em>.&rdquo; (Acts 22)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tFinally, we have brother Dinh Van Hoang, who shares the gospel in the central highlands of Vietnam with the K&rsquo;Dong people.&nbsp; The K&rsquo;Dong make sacrifices to animistic gods, but God is working powerfully to overcome this idolatry.&nbsp; Through Dinh&rsquo;s work, God has planted six house churches and baptized more than 400 believers.&nbsp; Dinh has been beaten, survived two attempts on his life, and had seven homes destroyed by authorities.&nbsp; They told him they would help him rebuild his house if he would renounce his faith in Jesus.&nbsp; Although at times he has been dejected, his attitude is, &ldquo;Jesus himself had to suffer to pay the price to save the world.&nbsp; Who are you to refuse the sufferings that the Lord Jesus foretold?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe Communists and all unbelievers believe they are the &ldquo;wise&rdquo; of the world.&nbsp; They have chosen the things of this world, things that will eventually be burned up.&nbsp; But Cong, Bounchan, Pao, Ma, and Dinh are fools for Christ.&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>26 For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble; 27 but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong, 28 and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the things that are, 29 so that no man may boast before God. 30 But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, 31 so that, just as it is written, &ldquo;Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the eyes of the world, our brothers are foolish; in God&rsquo;s eyes, they are wise.&nbsp; By God&rsquo;s grace, may we wisely join them in their foolishness.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By now, most people, at least here in the U.S., have heard about the uproar over the beliefs of the owner of Chick-fil-A.&nbsp; In a recent interview, Dan Cathy, the president of Chick-fil-A, spoke about the business their family built, and their Christian approach to the business.&nbsp; Toward the end of the interview, Mr. Cathy made a couple of statements that ignited a nationwide debate over the family and marriage.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s how the interview went:</p>\n\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Some have opposed the company&#39;s support of the traditional family. \"Well, guilty as charged,\" said Cathy when asked about the company&#39;s position.</h5>\n\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We are very much supportive of the family -- the biblical definition of the family unit. We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives.&nbsp; We give God thanks for that.</h5>\n\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We operate as a family business ... our restaurants are typically led by families; some are single.&nbsp; We want to do anything we possibly can to strengthen families. We are very much committed to that,\" Cathy emphasized.</h5>\n\n<h5 style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We intend to stay the course,\" he said.&nbsp; \"We know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many people later labeled Mr. Cathy and the Chick-fil-A organization as &ldquo;anti-gay&rdquo;.&nbsp;(Interestingly, notice from the above interview that Mr. Cathy only said he is pro-family, and holds to the Biblical view of marriage and family, but I digress.)&nbsp;This led a man named Adam Smith (no relation) to visit a Chick-fil-A drive-thru on &ldquo;Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day&rdquo;, where he berated the lady who took his order.&nbsp;Unfortunately for Mr. Smith, he also posted a <strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/xlayvgF-0p0\" target=\"_blank\">video</a></strong> online&nbsp;and was fired from his job as a result.&nbsp;Positively, Mr. Smith has since recorded another video where he apologizes to the lady who took his order.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This brings me to the point of this article.&nbsp; The lady&rsquo;s name is Rachel, and if you watch Mr. Smith&rsquo;s video of him berating Rachel and Chick-fil-A, you&rsquo;ll see that she never loses her cool, and treats him with kindness.\\ &nbsp;Recognizing this, in his apology video Mr. Smith says, &ldquo;You [Rachel] handled my frustrating rant with such dignity and composure every time I watch the video I&rsquo;m blown away by really the beauty of what you did and your kindness and your patience.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It turns out that Rachel is a Christian.&nbsp; In an interview after this incident occurred, Rachel said, &ldquo;I was just really concerned about him taping.&nbsp; I knew he was going to post it.&nbsp; That was my main fear,&rdquo; Rachel said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Christian and God tells us to love thy neighbor,&rdquo; she added referring to how she kept the exchange polite on her end.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What a great example Rachel is for all people, but especially believers.&nbsp; Rachel&rsquo;s behavior brings to mind 1 Peter 3, where we read:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;<em>8 To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit; 9&nbsp; not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing. 10 For, &ldquo;The one who desires life, to love and see good days, Must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.&nbsp; 11 &ldquo; He must turn away from evil and do good; He must seek peace and pursue it.&nbsp; 12 &ldquo; For the eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous, And His ears attend to their prayer, But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; 13&nbsp; Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good? 14 But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. And do not fear their intimidation, and do not be troubled, 15 but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence; 16 and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Rachel&rsquo;s behavior, not only did she bring Mr. Smith to shame, but she glorified God.&nbsp; This should be an encouragement for all of us, to follow her example, as she was obviously following the example of our Lord.&nbsp; And let&rsquo;s encourage each other to good works, just as we read in Hebrews 10:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; 24 and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25 not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One last thing.&nbsp; Mr. Smith originally wanted to meet personally with Rachel to apologize.&nbsp; She could not meet with him initially, but does plan on meeting with him soon.&nbsp; In her interview, she said she wanted to let Mr. Smith know why she handled the situation the way she did.&nbsp; Pray for Rachel that she would have the boldness to share the gospel with Mr. Smith.&nbsp; Assuming he is not a believer, pray that the Lord will open his heart that he, too, may glorify God and give Him thanks for the salvation that we now enjoy.&nbsp; Pray also that the Lord would quickly provide another job for Mr. Smith.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI was headed down the main road of my subdivision today when I saw a black truck, obviously exceeding the speed limit, coming toward me from the opposite direction. He had something bundled under a tarp in the back of the truck and I wondered if it could explain the excessive speed. I decided to try to get a better look as he sped past. Rather than whip my head around to see behind me, I tried taking a glance in my rearview mirror, which didn&rsquo;t work out too well because&hellip; (wait for it&hellip;) I was walking.</p>\n<p>\n\tI immediately began justifying my insanity with the defense that we <em><strong>should</strong></em> have rear view vision, even if we, in fact, don&rsquo;t. Think of all the benefits: failed zombie attacks, credibility to the eyes-in-the-back-of-her-head suspicion of moms everywhere, no more injuries caused by missed chairs or raised toilet seats in the middle of the night (injury to my husband that is). The list is endless. In fact, as I pondered the practicality of it, the scripture passage my son and I read yesterday came to mind. (I&rsquo;ve used this before in case you weren&rsquo;t paying attention!)</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan. He said to the Israelites, &ldquo;In the future when your descendants ask their fathers, &lsquo;What do these stones mean?&rsquo; tell them, &lsquo;Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.&rsquo; For the LORD your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The LORD your God did to the Jordan just what he had done to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over. He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the LORD is powerful and so that you might always fear the LORD your God.&rdquo; </em>Joshua 4:20-24</p>\n<p>\n\tYou&rsquo;ll have to read the context of the back story for yourself, but notice what God said here in &ldquo;Melissa-translation&rdquo;. He said, &ldquo;Check the rear view.&rdquo; He wanted them to remember both the mistakes they had made &ndash; or rather that their parents had made &ndash; and the lessons they had learned about God&rsquo;s faithfulness. If we had spiritual rear view vision, we could avoid letting things sneak up on us and take us by surprise. We would see the ambush coming in time to prepare and recall how God rescued us the last time we were blind-sided. And we would never ever doubt His presence or His activity in our lives. It would be there in the rear view.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the Lord was preparing this post for me today even before I got here, I had a conversation with my son about my salvation story. As I retold it for his 15-year-old ears I could hear it anew myself. The <em><strong>wonder</strong></em> of it took my breath away and has left me pensively humbled all afternoon.<em><strong> This</strong></em> is spiritual rear view vision. It is a mark on the passing landscape that I can see only in hind sight, but one that bears looking back upon because it equips me for where I&rsquo;m going.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is nothing stopping us from harnessing this super-power except ourselves, so let&rsquo;s commit to putting up a few standing stones in our spiritual rear view and taking note of both the threats impending and lessons learned. Tell your stories (His stories). Write them down. Mount a sticky-note campaign. Pile up some rocks on the kitchen windowsill. Remember. Recall. Reflect on the rear view.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<u>Post script &ndash;</u> I realize I left you hanging a little with that opening bit. <em><strong>What</strong></em> was in the truck?! <em><strong>Why</strong></em> was he driving so fast?! Can&rsquo;t tell you&hellip;couldn&rsquo;t see it. No rear view. Sorry. (Insert sheepish shrug here.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<u>Post post script &ndash;</u> I also just noticed the pattern between my last post and this one. Funny how God sometimes works by theme. No idea what it means except to repeat the verse that comes to mind&hellip;with my emphasis.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>You hem me in&mdash;behind and before</strong></em>; <em>you have laid your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.</em> Psalm 139:5-6</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tIn my previous articles in this series, we looked at the words justification, or justified and propitiation.&nbsp; In this last article, we&rsquo;ll consider another very important, big, &ldquo;churchy&rdquo; word that all Christians should know:&nbsp; imputation.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou may recall that one of the comments made by a Christian pastor was, &ldquo;The doctrine of imputation is not very important to my ministry.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t use that term but do discuss the issue.&nbsp; I have to bring it down to people&rsquo;s level, how it fits into day to day life.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s interesting, but it&rsquo;s clearly not how God intended us to understand this concept.&nbsp; Furthermore, since God did use that term (unlike this pastor), it&rsquo;s obvious that He wants us to know that term as well, since that is the word He placed in Holy Scripture.&nbsp; Rather than dumbing it down (i.e., &ldquo;bring it down to people&rsquo;s level, as if the Holy Spirit can&rsquo;t make believers understand His word), since God used this particular word it&rsquo;s apparent that He desires us to understand it.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom a salvation perspective, one of the first places we encounter this word is in Genesis 15:6, speaking about Abraham says, &ldquo;Then he believed in the Lord; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness.&rdquo; Here, the word is &ldquo;reckoned&rdquo;.&nbsp; We see this same word in Psalm 32. Verses 1 and 2 read, &ldquo;How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered! How blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Hebrew word is chashab (pronounced kh&auml;&middot;shav&#39;), and it means to charge, impute, reckon, count. &nbsp;It can also mean to think, which gives a scholarly tone to us here in Texas when we say things like, &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll read my Bible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the New Testament, we see this word used in a similar way.&nbsp; The Greek word for impute is elloge&#333; (pronounced el-lo-ge&rsquo;-&#333;), which means to reckon, set to one&rsquo;s account, lay to one&rsquo;s charge, impute.&nbsp; Another word used for imputation (and is used much more than elloge&#333;) is logizomai (pronounced lo-g&#275;&#39;-zo-m&#299;).&nbsp; This is similar, and means to reckon, count, impute, to pass to one&rsquo;s account.</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps one of the most important (and joyful) passages in all of Scripture is found in Romans 4.&nbsp; Here, we see Paul quoting the verses from the Old Testament we mentioned above:&nbsp; &ldquo;3 For what does the Scripture say?&nbsp; &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; 4 Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. 5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness, 6 just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:&nbsp; 7 &ldquo;Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, And whose sins have been covered.&nbsp; 8 &ldquo;Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tBeloved, this is the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ!&nbsp; Why, then, would we not want to know the very words of God so that we may fully understand this good news?&nbsp; It makes no sense.</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing on this great passage in Romans 4 is another great passage in chapter 5.&nbsp; Just as Adam&rsquo;s sin was imputed to us through the Fall, Jesus&rsquo; perfect righteousness is imputed to us by faith.&nbsp; Romans 5 puts it this way, &ldquo;18 So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. 19 For as through the one man&rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; How are we made righteous by Christ&rsquo;s obedience?&nbsp; By God crediting it to us by faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoing back to the pastor&rsquo;s comment, one might ask how this fits into our every day life.&nbsp; Well, knowing what imputation means should flood your mind with the understanding of the passages mentioned above (as well as the many others in Scripture that use this word).&nbsp; Just calling this word to your mind should cause you, on a daily basis, to rejoice.&nbsp; Because our names are in the Book of Life due solely to Christ&rsquo;s propitiation for our sins and His righteousness credited to us, both by faith, we are to rejoice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is why Paul says in Philippians 4:4-7, &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice! &nbsp;Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near. Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; If that doesn&rsquo;t affect your everyday life, then you&rsquo;re doing something wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom this article series, you now have three important words in your Christian vocabulary.&nbsp; If you have a pastor who thinks like the pastors whose comments we mentioned in Part I, then let him know that you desire to understand the words God uses, the meat of His word.&nbsp; Of course, we are to do this gently, lovingly, just as we&rsquo;d do to our own brother.&nbsp; When we study the words God uses, then we can grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tEvery year for the past 5 years my son has attended a sleep-away camp in one of the local state park reserves. It is not officially part of the Ozark National Forest but once you leave the blacktop in Arkansas, it may as well be. When I was growing up and visiting my grandparents in the central part of the state, the highlight of our trip was always the moment when I puked over the back of the front seat, or on the side of the road. Wait for it&hellip;.wait for it&hellip;NOW! (Those road-side days were few and far between but did garner me some measure of sympathy solely as the reward for adequate warning!) Just typing this makes me queasy remembering the up and down, twist and turn, hot open-window air, vinyl seat slimy with sweat, and that blue trash can my grandmother had strategically positioned for that dreaded moment. I digress&hellip;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe road to my son&rsquo;s camp is on the order of those I remember as a child. Like I said, once you leave civilization, and it doesn&rsquo;t take long, every road is what we call a pig-trail. Today as we drove along I had time to think about the past week and how it reminds me of the road we were on. Bear with me.</p>\n<p>\n\tAbout a month ago my Father-in-Law fell and broke his hip. Badly. The 90 minute surgery turned into 9 &frac12; hours, which resulted in further complications. We are not there to help shoulder the responsibilities that have gone along with the extended and complicated rehab that he is still enduring: or to help make decisions about the &ldquo;remodeling&rdquo; that has to be done, or carry any of the burden of the emotional toll it has taken on the family. Last week it all came to an ugly head like a major zit-pop if you&rsquo;ll pardon the disgusting simile. That&rsquo;s the most appropriate way to describe the episode from what I&rsquo;ve gathered third hand.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso during last week a friend&rsquo;s son arrived home from a mission trip in Puerto Rico where he had fallen seriously ill. It was a miracle that he got home, but he arrived much more ill than they had originally understood and went from the airport gate to the PICU at St. Louis Children&rsquo;s Hospital. (That&rsquo;s a shout out to the BEST pediatric hospital IN THE WORLD although I might be biased. That&rsquo;s another story&hellip;) While he is well enough to go home today, his recovery will be long and challenging in ways they are only imagining at this point. But that image will be reality soon, and it will be more crippling than they imagine at this point. And there is my jumping off point.</p>\n<p>\n\tDriving through the Ozark mountains (humor me the technicality) is exactly like what my husband&rsquo;s family and my friends are enduring. There are unexpected twists and turns in the road, stomach wrenching sudden drops, and always, <em><strong>always</strong></em> the inability to see what&rsquo;s ahead whether over the next hump or around the next curve. (My mother used to think it funny to suddenly shout, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the road!?&rdquo; which usually earned her an early-vomit-episode thanks to the combination of bile and adrenaline. You&rsquo;re never going to read my articles again, are you?)</p>\n<p>\n\tToday I realized that although the road ahead was often hidden from view and always uncertain, the car in front of us (obviously not locals judging by the pace they were setting and the smoking breaks) was acting like God &ndash; imagine their surprise. Yes, they were headed to camp as well and since they were traveling the road ahead of us, they got everywhere we were going first. Imagine that. If that isn&rsquo;t a statement of the obvious, I don&rsquo;t know what is. But think about how obvious it is and yet how often we forget that about our Lord. He&rsquo;s traveled this road and He&rsquo;s already on the downhill side of that one we can&rsquo;t see over. Heck, we can&rsquo;t even see the road beneath us when we get to the top! It&rsquo;s just a straight drop to the bottom. But wait&hellip;there&rsquo;s that car and He got there safely, so there is hope for us! All we have to do is keep on following.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow you all may be remembering another article I posted a while back that had a similar (identical?) message, but I thought in light of this week&rsquo;s circumstances it was good to recall that we never know where we&rsquo;re going! Tragedy and accidents happen. Jobs are lost. Health is suddenly compromised. In a minute, life is irrevocably changed. We live in a fallen world &ndash; we have not reached the Promised Land yet. The unexpected should be expected!&nbsp; Twist. Turn. Bottom out. Puke! Then we get back on the road and keep following that lead car. He never said it would be easy. He never promised that the road would not go through the Ozark foothills. And He never expected that you wouldn&rsquo;t lose your lunch as a result of the ride of sheer terror. He only asked that you follow. And keep following. We don&rsquo;t quit following when the following gets hard, we quit when we get there.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, I hope this has been a silly bit of kick-in-the-pants encouragement. God is ahead of you on whatever road you&rsquo;re driving. If you think you&rsquo;re on the freeway of life right now, don&rsquo;t suddenly decide to take the scenic route. Soon enough you&rsquo;ll have to turn off the black top, and then, welcome to the ride! Keep the Lord in front of you and&hellip; keep driving!<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

for us to understand?&nbsp; Think about how difficult it would be for us to grow in our understanding and knowledge if our vocabulary were limited such that we weren&rsquo;t taught the actual words represented by these concepts.&nbsp; Rather than grow in our understanding, we&rsquo;d wallow in shallowness.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSadly, this is the approach of many Christian pastors towards teaching Scripture.&nbsp; Rather than use the actual words God chose, they instead teach the concepts, thus dumbing down what Scripture actually teaches with this Christian Speak.&nbsp; On a recent White Horse Inn program (a Christian radio program), they played clips of interviews with Christian pastors, asking them about their use of the words justification, propitiation, and imputation.&nbsp; Arguably, these are some of the most important words in the Bible, as they describe and help us to understand the great salvation that is ours in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; Here are the pastors&rsquo; responses:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&bull; I usually translate those terms into terms people can grab a little bit more easily.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&bull; Those are churchy words and I try to avoid them.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re dealing with a culture that doesn&rsquo;t want the show, they want authenticity.&nbsp; I try to use culturally relevant illustrations because that&rsquo;s what Jesus did.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t<br />\n\t&bull; If they heard those words, my congregation would say, &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; I teach the concepts without using the big words.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not into the religious language so much.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t<br />\n\t&bull; The doctrine of imputation is not very important to my ministry.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t use that term but do discuss the issue.&nbsp; I have to bring it down to people&rsquo;s level, how it fits into day to day life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t<br />\n\t&bull; If you asked my congregation about doctrine, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; Apologetics don&rsquo;t matter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t<br />\n\t&bull; I&rsquo;m not going to talk about justification and all that Paul goes through and struggles with in Romans.&nbsp; I want to know what is Jesus doing in your life now.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tReading these comments, it&rsquo;s hard to know where to begin to discuss them; so much could be said!&nbsp; First and foremost, however, is the absolute arrogance on display.&nbsp; Consider that all Scripture is God breathed (2 Timothy 3:16).&nbsp; That is to say, the God of the universe, the Creator of all things, chose the individual words that are recorded for us in Scripture.&nbsp; Yet, these and many other pastors, in their &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; have decided that these words are too &ldquo;big&rdquo;, too &ldquo;churchy&rdquo;, too &ldquo;showy&rdquo;, too &ldquo;religious&rdquo;.&nbsp; Somehow, they have decided that they know better than God, and have figured out better words to use.&nbsp; This is the height of arrogance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSecond, this assumes that believers, who are indwelt by the Holy Spirit, would not understand and even be bored by the actual words that are in Scripture.&nbsp; Again, somehow, these pastors have figured out &ldquo;better&rdquo; words to use to teach these concepts.&nbsp; But God tells us that He will sanctify us in the truth, which is His word (John 17:17).&nbsp; That, of course, means Scripture, which means we need to use the words God chose.&nbsp; We need to conform to God and His word, not have Scripture conform to us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThird, God says that Scripture (meaning the words God chose to write for us) is &ldquo;<em>profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work</em>.&rdquo; (2 Timothy 3:16-17)&nbsp; This is the job of the pastor, to feed God&rsquo;s sheep.&nbsp; As part of that feeding, the pastor needs to instruct believers in the meaning of God&rsquo;s word, and that requires introducing them to words that God used, like justification, propitiation, sanctification, and imputation.&nbsp; It is through these very words that God teaches us, reproves us, corrects us, and trains us in righteousness.&nbsp; It is this God ordained process by which we are made adequate and equipped for God&rsquo;s work.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThankfully, our schools do teach us new words, by which we grow in our knowledge and understanding.&nbsp; Likewise, pastors should stick to the words God chose for us in His holy word.&nbsp; God does not call us to be culturally relevant based on what the culture desires.&nbsp; Ironically, we can only be culturally relevant if we have the true gospel, and the &ldquo;big, churchy&rdquo; words are the ones God gave us to help us understand His gospel.&nbsp; If pastors will feed the sheep with God&rsquo;s food, then God&rsquo;s people can be a light that shines for His glory.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNext, I&#39;ll take a look at some of these &ldquo;big, churchy&rdquo; words to examine their true meaning. <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/do_you_speak_christian_part_ii/\"><strong>Continue reading Part 2...</strong></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI&rsquo;m doing the church search. Yes&hellip;I made the very difficult decision recently to leave my church home. I did so peacefully, with my pastor&rsquo;s blessing, and for no small reasons &ndash; just to qualify. Now I find myself in that terrible un-tethered time of timidly tip-toeing into an unfamiliar church, trying to remain anonymous while hoping to be embraced.&nbsp; I visited a church a few weeks ago and realized, even as I sat in the pew, that it was not the one I&#39;m looking for. I then had to ask myself exactly what I <em>am</em> looking for. Somehow when I started this journey I just felt (foolishly and childishly) sure that I&rsquo;ll know it when I find it. Are you familiar with the feeling?<br />\n\t<br />\n\tPicture it with me. The lights are dim, the TV is on, the house is quiet and BAM suddenly it hits you &ndash; the craving. Your mouth just wants&hellip;something. So off to the pantry you go. Rummaging around among boxes and bags, you sample a little of this and a little of that but nothing really hits that spot. Nothing satisfies the craving, and you realize that whatever it is you&rsquo;re looking for, it isn&rsquo;t there.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, I&rsquo;m thinking about this church search business, and life, and disappointment, and longing, and I&rsquo;ve discovered something. I&rsquo;ve discovered that the <em>hope</em> of heaven is really enough. I can nibble my way through this life, finding some good things and making myself full and moderately content, but I will never find anything that fills my heart&rsquo;s desire. It&rsquo;s a longing for something this world can&rsquo;t provide, and were it not for the promise of one day finding that box of double stuffed Oreos hidden behind the rice cakes my days would be crushing in their defeat. I would spend my life in the pantry ever rummaging, never finding, always despairing. (I think this describes an unbeliever. Imagine the torment of thinking, \"This is as good as it gets...and I&#39;m still hungry!\")&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThere will be disappointment in my today. There will be hurt in my tomorrow. I may never find what I don&rsquo;t even know that I&#39;m looking for in a church. I live in a fallen and imperfect world, so I know that these are truths I can take to the bank. Something else I know is that heaven is so much better than anything I could ask for or even imagine so I can endure this world&rsquo;s disappointments with that hope, with joy, and with the tantalizing tremor of a desire deferred - deferred, not denied. I don&#39;t have to keep rummaging in despair. I know whom I have believed and He will be faithful to guard the longing I have entrusted to Him for that day. In the mean time I will make the best of <em>this</em> day, squeezing the life out of it, seizing every opportunity for fulfillment and satisfaction, knowing that I will end the day discontented and dissatisfied in some ways, because this world is all rice cakes. But I will end the day with the peace of knowing that everything I longed for today is AMEN in Jesus Christ and I will find it in His arms one day. Rice cakes today&hellip;double stuffs to come. Oh. Joy.&nbsp;</p>\n"

In this article, we&rsquo;ll consider another &ldquo;big, churchy&rdquo; <strong>Christian Speak</strong> word:&nbsp; <em>propitiation</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we think about the good news (i.e., the gospel) that is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we need to think about <em>why</em> He is good news.&nbsp; One aspect of why Jesus is good news is that on the cross, He paid the penalty for our sins.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important to note that God never overlooks sin; by His nature, He must punish sin.&nbsp; Although all believers escape God&rsquo;s wrath and suffer no condemnation, God still had to punish our sin.&nbsp; He did this by pouring out His wrath on His Son, wrath that we deserved.&nbsp; 1 John 4:10 states this very well:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe original Greek word for propitiation is <em>hilasterion</em> (pronounced hil-as-tay&#39;-ree-on).&nbsp; It means &ldquo;relating to an appeasing or expiating, having placating or expiating force, expiatory; a means of appeasing or expiating.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other words, Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice of Himself on the cross was an acceptable payment for the punishment of our sins; His sacrifice appeased God&rsquo;s wrath.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile most versions of the Bible use the word propitiation, some translate this word differently.&nbsp; For example, the NIV translates it as &ldquo;an atoning sacrifice&rdquo; rather than propitiation.&nbsp; Although this does not present the full force of what Christ has done for us (in my opinion), it does use language that points back to the Old Testament and the shadow of the Law that pointed to Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tHebrews 9 says, &ldquo;<em>1 Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary. 2 For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place. 3 Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies, 4 having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron&rsquo;s rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant; 5 and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same Greek word that is used for propitiation is used for the words &ldquo;mercy seat&rdquo; in v. 5.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Leviticus 16, God gave instructions in the Law that provided atonement for the high priest (Aaron at the time) as well as for all Israel.&nbsp; This was accomplished by sprinkling the blood of a bull (for Aaron&rsquo;s and his family&rsquo;s sins) and the blood of a goat (for the people&rsquo;s sins) on the mercy seat.&nbsp; It reads, in part, as follows:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>15 &ldquo;Then he shall slaughter the goat of the sin offering which is for the people, and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat. 16&nbsp; He shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the impurities of the sons of Israel and because of their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and thus he shall do for the tent of meeting which abides with them in the midst of their impurities</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat a beautiful picture of Christ this is!&nbsp; The ceremony that was done by the high priest once a year in the tabernacle, in the Holy of Holies, pointed to what Christ would do on the cross.&nbsp; Under the Law, this had to be done every year, which served as a constant reminder to the Israelites that they were sinful and that God&rsquo;s wrath had to be appeased.&nbsp; This was accomplished by sprinkling the blood of bulls and goats on the &ldquo;mercy seat&rdquo;, which served as a picture of the true sacrifice that would be the real propitiation for our sins.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnlike the Law, however, God&rsquo;s New Covenant is better.&nbsp; Rather than types and shadows, Christ is the reality to which the Law pointed.&nbsp; Hebrews 10 puts it this way:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;<em>1 For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near. 2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins? 3 But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year.&nbsp; 4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 5 Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says, &ldquo;Sacrifice and offering You have not desired, But a body You have prepared for Me; 6&nbsp; In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You have taken no pleasure. 7 &ldquo;Then I said, &lsquo;Behold, I have come (In the scroll of the book it is written of Me) To do Your will, O God.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; 8 After saying above, &ldquo;Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You have not desired, nor have You taken pleasure in them&rdquo; (which are offered according to the Law), 9 then He said, &ldquo;Behold, I have come to do Your will.&rdquo;&nbsp; He takes away the first in order to establish the second.&nbsp; 10 By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tNote also that this sacrifice was a one time sacrifice.&nbsp; Hebrews 10 goes on to explain:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;<em>11 Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; 12 but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that time onward until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet. 14 For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. 15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying, 16 &ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, says the Lord:&nbsp; I will put My laws upon their heart, And on their mind I will write them,&rdquo; He then says, 17 &ldquo;And their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; 18 Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tBrothers and sisters, it simply does not get any better than this!&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s once for all time atoning sacrifice, His propitiation for our sins, has perfected us who believe in Him.&nbsp; Because we have forgiveness, there no longer needs to be further offering for sin.&nbsp; Notice also that God&rsquo;s forgiveness is not passive, but active.&nbsp; He says He will <em>remember our sins no more</em>.&nbsp; He does not forget; rather, He actively remembers them no more.&nbsp; Our God is an awesome God!</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, now you have yet another word in your Christian vocabulary.&nbsp; Consider all of the above, and how much that God has done for us in Christ is wrapped up in that one single word, <em>propitiation</em>.&nbsp; Now, when you hear this word, not only will you understand what it means, but you&rsquo;ll also have an expanded appreciation of our sin and just how much Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross meant to appeasing the wrath of God that we deserved.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tMy friends&rsquo; dog broke free of its leash a couple of weeks ago. They just discovered that right around the corner from their house Rex was hit by a car and later died at the animal hospital. I know Rex was a dog, but his escape and its ensuing consequences made me think about how we all tend to strain against the leash, so to speak. We tell ourselves that we won&rsquo;t be mastered; we demand our independence and yet we are unaware that we have given our lives to the greediness of our various appetites, obeying their every order while straining against restraint. It&rsquo;s a paradox of which we are, mostly, blissfully unaware. Rex was the poster child&hellip;er&hellip;dog&hellip;for this dichotomy.</p>\n<p>\n\tI realized a while back, following a friend&rsquo;s off-handed remark that her stomach is not her god, that I could not make the same claim. Call it a moment of awakening. I had to admit that my appetite had mastered me. It was calling the shots and I was bowing in submission to its demands. I had allowed it to become my god, all the while believing that I was living in freedom. Freedom from what? Freedom from the restraint of God&rsquo;s word on gluttony. No, I didn&rsquo;t consciously make this decision, and therein lies my point in part.&nbsp; Hang with me while I get up in your business here.</p>\n<p>\n\tThink about your daily routine. What can&rsquo;t you live without? Oh, I know that you know you can <em><strong>live</strong></em> without your little pet habits, but really, what is it that has you on its leash? Is it caffeine? Is it your phone?&nbsp; Is it that &ldquo;one last try&rdquo; at the lottery? Facebook? Pinterest? Does the god that holds your leash have a big blue sign that reads, &ldquo;GOODWILL&rdquo;, or a small one that entices, &ldquo;Garage Sale&rdquo;, or perhaps the mother lode&hellip;&rdquo;MALL&rdquo;? We give little thought to these seemingly harmless habits, enjoying our freedom to indulge here and there, and we don&rsquo;t realize that we have become compelled to obey their urgings. Before long our freedom becomes slavery and (taking a lesson from Rex) destruction is on its heels.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I&rsquo;m learning through this awakening is that I have sold myself to my own urges. It&rsquo;s ridiculous when you think of it. Who is in charge here anyway, the body that I simply walk around in, the sub consciousness that the world has programmed within me, or God? Have I abdicated control of my life to something so stupidly primal as my growling stomach? Do I run to appease its demands? Yes. Indeed I have, and I do. And I&rsquo;ve been running flat out toward the busy street, oblivious to the danger. Like a dog off the leash. Or a fool.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I think about poor Rex, I have to admit that my advanced intelligence does not elevate me far above his base impulse to escape his perceived restraint. Truth is: he had it good. Real good. And so do I. I serve a God who doesn&rsquo;t keep me chained. I am completely free to seek either my own destruction, or His will.&nbsp;Like Rex at the end of a broken leash, I am free to leave the yard or wait faithfully for the one who will open the patio door, give me a bone, and scratch my ears.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is beauty and mortal danger in that kind of freedom. When we choose to leave the yard untethered, doom awaits us just around the corner. When I think I&rsquo;m choosing independence, I&rsquo;m really only choosing a different brand of servitude and a different god to serve. When I tell myself that I&rsquo;m under grace, I sacrifice my blood-bought freedom on the altar of my own impulses. When I blunder around unconsciously driven by blind impulses, I lock myself in the darkness of sinful ignorance.&nbsp; Paul says it perfectly in 1 Corinthians 6:12. <em>&lsquo;&ldquo;Everything is permissible for me&rdquo;&mdash;but not everything is beneficial. &ldquo;Everything is permissible for me&rdquo;&mdash;but I will not be mastered by anything. &ldquo;Food for the stomach and the stomach for food&rdquo;&mdash;but God will destroy them both.&#39;</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;I will not be mastered by anything.&rdquo; </em>ANYTHING. Including my desire to shuck God&rsquo;s loving restraint and run amok in the world like a heedless moron. (I speak to myself here. There are currently no morons reading this post!!)</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;m not telling you that I have this figured out, but what I promise you unequivocally is that if you ask the Lord to expose your household idols, He will do so in a way that is both gentle and merciless. He will not play second fiddle to the god of your perceived need for a bite of chocolate. He will leave you alone to obey your chosen master&hellip;and He will allow the consequences that follow. And though He is with you, you go it alone. Do you understand? The kind of freedom I&rsquo;m looking for doesn&rsquo;t end with me beneath the wheels of a minivan&hellip;or an 18-wheeler.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe kind of freedom I&rsquo;m looking for is the freedom to become a slave to the One who loved me so much that He died to prevent me from becoming eternal road-kill. In my freedom, I will resist the urge to take off in wild abandon to serve other gods. Yes, I will still hear their calls from just beyond the fence, but I am not obligated to answer. Instead, I will press my nose against the door and watch for my Master&rsquo;s approach, leash in hand. Together we will walk in freedom, but I will not leave the yard without Him. (I&rsquo;m praying for an electric fence for the days of weakness and folly!)</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&lsquo;But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve&hellip;. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.&rsquo;</em>&nbsp; Joshua 24:15 (author&rsquo;s editing)</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tIn my <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/do_you_speak_christian/\"><strong>last article</strong></a> of this same title, I showed that many pastors today intentionally do not use certain Scriptural words because they believe they are too &ldquo;churchy&rdquo;, or too &ldquo;big&rdquo; for us to understand.&nbsp; Starting with this article and a few more to follow, we&rsquo;ll look at some of those shunned words, mainly because they are important words that all Christians should know and understand (<strong>Christian Speak</strong>).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tBefore considering these words, it&rsquo;s important to point out that not every version of the Bible will necessarily use the exact same word.&nbsp; Therefore, we&rsquo;ll look at the original Hebrew and Greek and what it means, and I&rsquo;ll try to point out different words from some of the more popular translations of the Bible when the words differ.&nbsp; In the case of the word we are considering here, most of the popular Bible versions are pretty consistent in its use.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThe first word we&rsquo;ll consider is <em>justification</em>, or <em>justified</em>.&nbsp; The Lord uses this word very often in the context of the gospel and our salvation (as a quick search for these words in an online Bible will demonstrate).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a word that is deeply rooted in the gospel message.&nbsp; The problem we all have is that we are sinners, and our sin has separated us from God.&nbsp; We are not perfectly righteous, but that is what is required for us to be reconciled to God.&nbsp; Because God is a just judge, He must punish sin, and that is exactly what He will do when all unbelievers are thrown into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:15).&nbsp; The good news for believers is that God has judged us as righteous by our faith in Christ; by faith, Christ&rsquo;s righteousness is imputed to the believer.&nbsp; That judgment is called <em>justification</em>, or <em>justified.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWe find this word in both the old and new testaments.&nbsp; For example, Isaiah 45:25 says, &ldquo;<em>In the LORD, all the offspring of Israel will be justified and will glory.</em>&rdquo;&nbsp; The Hebrew word used here is <em>tsadaq</em> (pronounced tsaw-dak), and it means &ldquo;to be just, to be righteous; to be put or made right; to declare righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; Notice that we are considered justified <em>in the LORD</em>.&nbsp; We are never righteous in and of ourselves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSimilarly, Romans 3 says, &ldquo;<em>21 But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, 22 even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction; 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Greek word for justified is <em>dikaioo</em> (pronounced dik-ah-yo&rsquo;-o), and it means &ldquo;to render righteous; to declare, pronounce, one to be just, righteous, or such as he ought to be.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThis is, of course, incredibly good news!&nbsp; The holy, righteous, sinless, all powerful creator of the universe declares us justified by faith in His Son, because of what Jesus accomplished on our behalf.&nbsp; Because of this justification, we have been saved from the wrath of an all holy God.&nbsp; It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God (Hebrews 10:31), for our God is a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29).&nbsp; But, because of Christ, we escape God&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp; Romans 5 says, &ldquo;<em>9 Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rather than being rightly condemned as sinners, in Christ (in the LORD, as Isaiah says), we are justified.&nbsp; This means we are declared righteous, and therefore are no longer under God&rsquo;s wrath.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSo, we see that the word justified/justification are very important words for the believer.&nbsp; In one word is summed up the content of the good news of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; When a believer hears this word, everything discussed above should come to his mind, and with it comes the confidence and assurance of what Jesus has done for us.&nbsp; Why would anyone want to not use this word?&nbsp; Why try to explain it some other way?&nbsp; Since the Holy Spirit indwells all believers, I am convinced that every believer will have no problem understanding these &ldquo;big, churchy&rdquo; words.&nbsp; On the contrary, every believer will grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ when this word is properly taught.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s by the teaching and preaching of God&rsquo;s word, not man&rsquo;s, that Christians have true unity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSpiritual growth, spiritual maturity, and unity are what God desires for His church.&nbsp; Ephesians 4 makes this clear:&nbsp; &ldquo;<em>11 And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, 12&nbsp; for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; 13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNow you have another word in your Christian vocabulary, one that our Lord God deems pretty important.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s pray that the Lord will lead those pastors who intentionally do not use the words God provided to instead preach and teach <em>His</em> words.&nbsp; In this way, God will be glorified and believers will grow in Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

I didn&rsquo;t, that is, until spring break when they burned under the steady application of a tropical sun.&nbsp; I was painfully embarrassed to have missed such a seemingly obvious body part when slathering sunscreen and I walked around for days radiating the indictment of my oversight.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tJust recently as I was sitting in church, the Lord began to deal with me through the pastor&rsquo;s words and before long my face was glowing as brightly as my burned feet had. I was radiating the indictment of an oversight&hellip;let&rsquo;s call it what it was&hellip;sin. I was oblivious to the need to cover this particular area of my life with the preventive measures of prayer, humility, and supplication. And now I was well and truly singed. Has this ever happened to you? There I was going about my business completely unaware that an entire piece of my life was vulnerably exposed to temptation. And the temptation that started out as a deceptively pleasant warm-glow-within turned into a consumption that I didn&rsquo;t notice until it began to hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, what&rsquo;s my advice? Well I&rsquo;m not sure I have any. We can be diligent and careful and self-aware for only so long before those preventive measures begin to wear thin and before you know it we&rsquo;re peeling in sheets. And let&rsquo;s be honest. We&rsquo;re not able to see every inch of exposure. Other people are much better at that but they usually don&rsquo;t point it out until it&rsquo;s too late. I love those two little words, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re burning&rdquo; which are usually accompanied by a much-too-late poke in the now painfully blistered area of risk. I always wonder why they don&rsquo;t warn you at the outset, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to burn&hellip;right <em>there</em>&rdquo; and give you the opportunity to avoid the suffering ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnyway&hellip;my feet have recovered and now have the lovely summer bronze that tells of a beach having been walked, and I&rsquo;ve applied proper treatment to that soul-scorch as well through confession and repentance. But despite the good outcome in both circumstances, I sincerely would have preferred to avoid the pain involved. So if you see me walking around foolishly blind to my own exposure, I invite you&hellip;I implore you&hellip;to point it out before I burn.</p>\n"

For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them, on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus</em>.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tPaul is not saying here that Gentiles obeyed the Law of Moses perfectly.&nbsp; The point here is that <em>all</em> humanity has the Law written in their hearts.&nbsp; We all know instinctively what we <em>should</em> do.&nbsp; Loving God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, and loving our neighbor as we love ourselves sums up the entire Law.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tWhile God put this in writing for Israel, He also put it on everyone&rsquo;s heart, so all would be without excuse when it comes to the knowledge of sin.&nbsp; The fact that most world religions have the Golden Rule plainly demonstrates what is stated here in Romans 2. Therefore, this proves the truth of Christianity by confirming what Scripture teaches.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tOf course, what these religions do not teach is that if one does not obey the golden rule perfectly (i.e., failing to love God with all of our heart, soul, mind and strength), the wrath of a just God is what awaits all of us.&nbsp; And, no one - absolutely no one - obeys perfectly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tThere is an exception:&nbsp; only in Christ do we find the one who obeyed the Law perfectly, who loved God with all of His heart, soul, mind and strength, and who loved His neighbor as He loved Himself.&nbsp; Other religions may have some truth of what we ought to do, but only Christ provides the solution for what we could not do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tSo, when you don&rsquo;t obey the golden rule, remember that if you are in Christ, He has obeyed it.&nbsp; And if you are in Christ, then your name is written in the book of life.&nbsp; Then, we can say with Paul, &ldquo;<em>Rejoice in the Lord Always; again I will say, rejoice</em>!&rdquo; (Philippians 4:4)</p>\n"

Propitiation is a weighty concept, but Easter is the perfect day of the year to contemplate Christ&#39;s death in our place and His righteousness appropriated by us through faith.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, I&#39;ve fielded many questions about God&#39;s grace and Christ&#39;s propitiation, and so I decided to address a couple of those questions in my Easter message. First, I tackled the question of how Christ&#39;s death could substitute for our own. Why was God willing to accept His Son&#39;s death in place of our own, and how does Christ&#39;s willingness to go to the cross spare us from Hell?</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I explored why Christ wasn&#39;t required to spend an eternity in Hell. If He was a substitute for us, why did Jesus spend only three days in the grave?</p>\n\n<p>I hope you agree these are important questions, and I can assure you the answers are worth our time and attention in study of Scripture. I pray you will take time to listen to my&nbsp;Easter 2012 message and share it with your family and friends. Propitiation is at the center of our Gospel, and it glorifies God every time we hear it preached.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your continuing support for our teaching ministry, and may the Lord bless your devotion to His holy word.</p>"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tI&rsquo;m in the process of learning Spanish, and it&rsquo;s tough.&nbsp; I can attest that the Lord knew exactly what He was doing at the tower of Babel; when God decides to confuse language so we can&rsquo;t understand one another&rsquo;s speech, He does it extremely well! (see <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/genesis_2011/genesis_2011_lesson_11a/\"><strong>Genesis 11</strong></a>)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tTwo verbs that are commonly used in Spanish but have the same nominal meaning are &ldquo;ser&rdquo; and &ldquo;estar&rdquo;.&nbsp; Both of them mean &ldquo;to be&rdquo;, so you can imagine how much use these verbs get.&nbsp; For example, think about how often you say, &ldquo;I am&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;I was&hellip;&rdquo;, etc.&nbsp; So, knowing how each verb is used is pretty important.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t&ldquo;Ser&rdquo; is used when one is speaking about something permanent, or lasting.&nbsp; For example, your name is permanent; I&rsquo;ll always be Brian (well, until we get to heaven, where we&rsquo;ll all be given a new name; Revelation 2:17) .&nbsp; Also, your gender is permanent; I&rsquo;ll always be a man.&nbsp; (Despite some people surgically changing their gender, they are still a man or woman, as the case may be; God decides this, not us.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Estar&rdquo; is used when one is speaking about something temporary, or referring to location.&nbsp; For example, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in my house right now&rdquo;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tAs I was learning the difference between these two verbs, I thought about our relationship to Christ.&nbsp; Which verb would I use in Spanish to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Christian&rdquo;?&nbsp; About this same time, I heard a teaching about Matthew 5, Jesus&rsquo; sermon on the mount and the beatitudes (which means &ldquo;blessings&rdquo;).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tThe good news is that &ldquo;ser&rdquo; would be used when we say we are a Christian, because it describes a permanent condition (&ldquo;Yo soy Cristiano&rdquo;).&nbsp; We are Christians because of what God does:&nbsp; He gives us new and eternal life, faith to believe the gospel, and love for Him.&nbsp; This never changes, it is now who we are.&nbsp; Just as a leopard cannot change its spots, we cannot change who we are.&nbsp; We are either sinners, which is by nature, or we are Christians by the grace of God.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tLikewise, in the beatitudes in Matthew 5, Jesus is describing who Christians are.&nbsp; Many people misinterpret the beatitudes as things we must do, and if we do them, we receive the blessings.&nbsp; Jesus describes these blessings as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t\t&nbsp; &nbsp;3<em> &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t\t<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 &ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t\t<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 &ldquo;Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t\t<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 &ldquo;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t\t<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 &ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t\t<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t\t<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 &ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t\t<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 &ldquo;Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</em></li>\n\t<li style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t\t<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 &ldquo;Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you</em>.&rdquo; (Matthew 5:3-11)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tThe people Jesus describes here are those who have been saved.&nbsp; For example, to be poor in spirit means that you know have nothing to offer God, that you are lacking and are in need.&nbsp; Such a person <em>needs</em> Christ, and only Christians know they <em>need</em> Christ.&nbsp; Therefore, a Christian can say, &ldquo;Yo soy pobre de espiritu.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, this applies to all of the blessings Christ mentions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tWhat&rsquo;s really amazing is that Jesus says that Christians <em>are</em> blessed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a permanent condition.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not based on our being poor in spirit, or mourning, or being gentle.&nbsp; These are simply adjectives that describe Christians.&nbsp; Indeed, it&rsquo;s the exact opposite of a works based view.&nbsp; We are not blessed by making our heart pure, for only Christ has a pure heart.&nbsp; Listen to what Psalm 24 says:</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\t&ldquo;<em>3 Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD?<br />\n\tAnd who may stand in His holy place?<br />\n\t4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart,<br />\n\tWho has not lifted up his soul to falsehood<br />\n\tAnd has not sworn deceitfully.<br />\n\t5 He shall receive a blessing from the LORD<br />\n\tAnd righteousness from the God of his salvation.<br />\n\t6 This is the generation of those who seek Him,<br />\n\tWho seek Your face&mdash;even Jacob.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selah.<br />\n\t7 Lift up your heads, O gates,<br />\n\tAnd be lifted up, O ancient doors,<br />\n\tThat the King of glory may come in!<br />\n\t8 Who is the King of glory?<br />\n\tThe LORD strong and mighty,<br />\n\tThe LORD mighty in battle</em>.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tThis psalm makes clear that the King of glory is the one who has a pure heart, the Lord strong and mighty!&nbsp; We are made pure in heart by the imputation of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness, a permanent condition.&nbsp; Therefore, I can say, &ldquo;Yo soy puro de corazon&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Todos ustedes son puros de corazon&rdquo; (you all are pure in heart; or, as we say in Texas, &ldquo;ya&rsquo;ll are pure in heart&rdquo;).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">\n\tOne day, we&rsquo;ll all speak the same language again, and I won&rsquo;t have to struggle with Spanish.&nbsp; Until that day, Jesus tells us to rejoice and be glad, because we <em>are</em> blessed.&nbsp; So, rejoice in your permanently blessed condition.&nbsp; &iexcl;A Dios sea la Gloria!<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI&rsquo;m under a tidal wave. I&rsquo;m not even treading water. I&rsquo;m being swept about, rolled on the sandy bottom, battered by waves and stung by jellies. It&rsquo;s not supposed to be this way.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe were on spring break last week and spent some time at the beach (Thanks Alabama!). On day three of our trip I was sitting contentedly with my toes in the sand when it occurred to me that I hadn&rsquo;t lifted one burden that I&rsquo;d left at home. Hadn&rsquo;t mulled over one decision. Hadn&rsquo;t gnawed on one worry. For three days I had been blissfully free and unaware&hellip;of life, of duty, of expectation. I was at rest in the security of a God who was rolling each wave to shore in a perfectly uninterrupted concerto of sound and light, enjoying the dance of an ocean breeze. It simply had not occurred to me to recall one detail of my ordinary life. I didn&rsquo;t consciously turn it all over to God, I just plain forgot about it as the miles ticked off under our wheels and the salt breeze began to tantalize. When I remembered all I had left back home, I didn&rsquo;t care. I was on the beach. All those concerns were at my desk. And God was over all. (Insert a sigh, and the sound of waves here.)</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, I&rsquo;m that man that James describes being tossed and blown this way and that by a stiff wind. I just can&rsquo;t seem to catch a break &ndash; or a breath. What happened? When did life begin again? Why did I pick it up, mull it over and gnaw the bone? The same God who handled the pause in my life is surely capable of handling the momentum that is now dragging me out to sea. Right?</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Who shut the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness, when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place, when I said, &ldquo;This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt?&rdquo; </em>(Job 38:8-11)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>This</strong></em> is the God I need right now. I need the God who empowered His son to say <em>&ldquo;Peace! Be still!</em>&rdquo; and the wind and the waves obeyed Him. Oh me of little faith. Why am I so afraid?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid because I&rsquo;m trying to swim against a rip-tide instead of allowing myself to relax and float to the surface. I&rsquo;m being drowned by my own effort to stay&nbsp;on top of the waves that would swamp me.&nbsp;I simply can&rsquo;t trust that it&rsquo;s possibly true that I&rsquo;m allowed to do NOTHING, and God will do everything.</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now as I pray, &ldquo;Lord! Help my unbelief!&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m going to roll up my pants-legs, wriggle off my shoes, slip on my shades and a wide brimmed hat, and I&rsquo;m going to go lay flat out on my patio and do absolutely nothing. God said I could trust Him to hold the tide at bay, and that it&rsquo;s OK to float sometimes. I don&rsquo;t see any walking on water in my near future, but this much I can do in faith. You too?</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI was sitting at my desk yesterday for almost three hours accomplishing nothing. I don&rsquo;t know why I persisted so long in my fruitless task. I just couldn&rsquo;t seem to turn loose of a lesson that was going nowhere until I simply ran out of time and had to leave it. When my husband asked me later how my day had been I said that it had been unproductive and frustrating. I said, &ldquo;I spent all day spinning my wheels.&rdquo; He laughed and asked me, &ldquo;Well, did you at least generate some smoke?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that&rsquo;s the funniest thing I&rsquo;ve heard in a while because it is so perfectly true of so much of my life. Picture a race car painted up shiny, engine roaring, tires squealing, and when the smoke clears it&rsquo;s still sitting at the starting line. The wheels have driven a hundred miles &ndash; at a hundred miles an hour &ndash; but the car has gone nowhere.</p>\n<p>\n\tMaybe this will step on your toes, but I think there are a lot of us generating a lot of smoke. We talk a good talk. We dress the part. We&rsquo;re very very busy. But we&rsquo;re not really getting anywhere that matters.&nbsp; Many of us believe that the smoke is the point, but the smoke just makes us loose sight of the finish line.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf I&nbsp;could give you a peek at my desk calendar, or a time-lapse film of&nbsp;my daily life,&nbsp;you would be amazed by how much time I spend spinning my wheels at a hundred miles an hour. You would be even more amazed at how much smoke I can generate! But at the sad end of the day, if you could crawl into my head, you would see that I haven&rsquo;t really gained any ground. I&rsquo;m still sitting at the starting line. The light is green. My engine is running. My paint is shiny. My tires are spinning. But it&rsquo;s all for show. I&rsquo;ve been working very hard at making sure I look like a race car, rather than making sure I&rsquo;m going the distance.</p>\n<p>\n\tOK. That&rsquo;s a lot of metaphor, but here&rsquo;s the bottom line. We&rsquo;re supposed to be getting somewhere, and that somewhere is established by God. Our finish line looks like holiness. Our track looks like obedience, and service, and active love, and forgiveness, and sacrifice. So why doesn&rsquo;t my calendar reflect those as my goals for today, tomorrow and tomorrow&rsquo;s tomorrows? Why do I spend my time in vain pursuits to keep up my image? Why do I chase the wind of worldly success? Why do I seek the praise of men? Because I&rsquo;ve lost sight of the finish line. I&rsquo;m trying to drive my Master&rsquo;s car on my own course, and bless His name, He&rsquo;s not letting me get anywhere in that fruitless effort. I&rsquo;m just spinning my wheels and generating smoke.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, maybe it&rsquo;s time to let the rubber cool a bit. To sit and let the smoke clear. To get the finish line well in sight. To align myself with it. And then to start again with better results. Maybe then, when I hold the measuring stick against the starting line and my distance down the track, it will measure in something more than inches.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn your mark&hellip; get set&hellip;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

We are not &ldquo;those&rdquo; Christians&hellip;the ones we all would <em><strong>like</strong></em> to be whose every conversation revolves around Christ and His work in our lives. No. We are not the super-spiritual. We are the super-desperate-to-get-one-thing-right. So, we pray in the few silent moments we have before reaching the carpool line and the gun goes off to start the race.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnyway&hellip;today I noticed that I was holding his hand, but he wasn&rsquo;t holding mine. I asked him what was up, and he insisted that yes, he was holding my hand too. Funny our difference of perspective: I really had a grip on him, but he was just kind of resting. It made me flash back to when he was a toddler. Rather than just rest in my grip then, he would actively try to yank free, fascinated by everything he saw.</p>\n<p>\n\tI used to loop my little finger over the back of his hand just to get a bit of added assurance for when he wanted adventure that led him straight into danger. I told my son this morning, &ldquo;This is what we do to God all day long. We let go, then grab hold. Let go, grab hold. Let go, grab hold&rdquo;, and we made a silly game of it until I really did have to let go to turn on the heater. But the thing about God is that He never lets go. He never has to. Not even to adjust the heat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tOkay, so this could go several directions. Like, thank goodness we can rest and the Lord never lets go. Or, too bad we do so much resting and not enough hanging on. And, how sad that we so often want to twist ourselves out of His grip to go off on our own and straight into the lion&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; I guess the bottom line is the same in every scenario. God. Never. Lets. Go. Never. Ever. Ever.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don&rsquo;t know what that does for you today, but for me it is nothing short of miraculous grace. I am that toddler most days desperate for my own way, charting the path of my own destruction, heedless to the dangers around me. Careless with my own well-being. Self-determined. Self-willed. Self-destructive. And yet, my God never lets go.</p>\n<p>\n\tI am desperate for that truth today. I am determined to hang on, but when I notice that I have been resting, I will hasten to tighten my hold. I will choose to be restrained by His grip, trusting that it is only this which prevents my total self-destruction. Gracious Father! Get a good grip and hang on tight!</p>\n"

For the first time, we&#39;re offering our Revelation course complete with written teaching notes and a full compliment of color slides and handouts. Our hope is other Bible instructors can reuse our materials in teaching small groups and Sunday school classes.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"Revelation slide\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/slidex.001.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; float: right; width: 200px; height: 150px; \" /></p>\n<p>\n\tRecently, we&#39;ve received feedback from listeners that our slides and handouts are causing problems for those who desire to print our materials on paper for distribution to students. Most of our Revelation handouts use a black background, which looks best when projected on a screen yet consumes large amounts of black ink when printed on paper. Since I teach Revelation with an overhead projector, the black background produces a pleasing look, but we never considered the effect of our color choice on the cost to print. Based on the feedback from our listeners though, we&#39;ve made an adjustment.</p>\n<p>\n\tStarting today, all our Revelation lessons offer both a Student&#39;s version and a Teacher&#39;s version of the slides. The student version retains the black backgrounds best suited to projection on a screen, while the teacher&#39;s version removes the black background to allow for economical printing. We hope this solution offers you the best of both worlds, and we appreciate the feedback.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe welcome other<strong> <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/contact/\">suggestions</a></strong> on how to make our materials better. Our ministry exists to teach God&#39;s word and to support and encourage other teachers in their ministry in the word. May the Lord continue to magnify these efforts to His glory!&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tA while back I wrote about faith being like a chair, and I used this quote:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;Those who have faith need no explanation. For those who have no faith, no explanation is possible.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\tI talked about not needing an explanation for why the chair holds me when I sit in it, and how faith is like that &ndash; no explanation required.</p>\n<p>\n\tRecently a friend who had read the post told me that she thought that it was important to occasionally do a chair inspection because sometimes the legs&nbsp;come out from under you. She should know. She&rsquo;s been through a year of testing like I would not wish on anyone except that the result has been a sturdier chair than she sat in before, and I would not have thought that possible. But that&rsquo;s just the thing. We get comfortable in our chair, and we take it for granted. We don&rsquo;t go looking for ways to improve on what we&rsquo;ve got or make it more solid. We sink into the soft spots that are shaped to our backsides, breathe a sigh and snuggle in.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy friend did nothing wrong. She was serving whole-heartedly, praying diligently, studying faithfully, loving God and people passionately, when suddenly there was a total collapse. Something she believed to be solid and unshakeable fell apart under her while she was snuggled up in her soft spot, and she crashed. In the months that followed she found herself shaking the dust off and putting the chair back together. And in that is the lesson: we can do a periodic inspection of the parts before the chair collapses, or we can inspect them as we reassemble the pieces.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is it that you&rsquo;re sitting on? Is it what we call, &ldquo;Fire Insurance&rdquo;; the &ldquo;get-out-of-hell-free&rdquo; card? Is it a Grandfather God of Grace who would never allow suffering to enter your life? Is it the God who rewards good works and tireless service but rarely lets you sit in the chair because of your self-sufficiency? Maybe your chair is sturdier than that, like my friend&rsquo;s. Maybe it is carved out of a solid piece of the Rock but it&rsquo;s never been tested by a burden that&rsquo;s twice the size of your spiritual shoulders. Even that chair will at least wobble under the weight. And all of these chairs require careful inspection. Will they hold you when you really need to be held and your burden is heavy?</p>\n<p>\n\tOur chair &ndash; our faith, is built on our God and who we believe Him to be even when He is suddenly unrecognizable. My friend had to ask, &ldquo;Are You <em>there</em>?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Are You <em>good</em>?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do You <em>see</em>?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Are You <em>strong</em>?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Are You <em>faithful</em>?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Can I trust You for <em>every </em>promise?&rdquo;.&nbsp; She had to inspect the faith for which she previously needed no explanation. As God began to answer her questions through His word, she has slowly begun to rebuild her chair.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tHer advice then, is a frequent inspection, but also that there truly is no explanation required. Yes, her chair was tested and collapsed under the weight, but the pieces were still there, and as she is putting them all back together she is affirming to herself that she doesn&rsquo;t need to see God to believe He is there. She doesn&rsquo;t need to feel good to know that God is good. She doesn&rsquo;t need immediate intervention to believe that God sees. She doesn&rsquo;t need to test God to know that He is strong.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t need everything to go her way to know that He is faithful. She doesn&rsquo;t need to see the fulfillment of every promise to know that she can trust Him for them. When she gets her chair reassembled it will be supported by the glue that holds it together &ndash; a trial. Even then, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll take certain things for granted ever again, and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll do a frequent chair inspection in the event that she can prevent another collapse.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow&rsquo;s your chair? Have you done an inspection? Does it wobble a bit? Are the rungs dislodged? Better shore it up before you have to sit in it with a heavy load!&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tGod often does His best work in us by pulling the rug out from under us, theologically speaking. Just when we begin to feel secure and confident standing on our preconceived ideas about God and His program, the Lord will bring us someone or something to intrude upon our blissful ignorance and disrupt our thinking. The effect can be disorienting and even painful.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, disruption is the Lord&#39;s favorite tactic for growing us spiritually and bringing us to a greater understanding of Himself and of who we are in Christ. Recently, Verse By Verse Ministry had the privilege to assist in one these disrupting moments for one of our readers concerning the topic of God&#39;s sovereignty in salvation.</p>\n<p>\n\tFew doctrines cause more angst and argument within the Body of Christ than those of election and predestination, and in my experience such debates usually become a battle of wits among unarmed men, as the saying goes.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur ministry strives to handle these exchanges with grace and truth, and we work hard to present a logical and Biblically-based perspective on serious matters like election without resorting to clich&eacute;s or recycling unhelpful arguments from various \"camps\" of thought. In this particular conversation with a reader (I will call \"Sally\"), we experienced a particularly fruitful outcome. I wanted to share the exchange in the hope others might benefit from it. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tPart One of our discussion follows below:</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t<strong>Sally:&nbsp;</strong></h5>\n<p>\n\tI was reading your answer to <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/is_there_an_age_of_accountability_in_the_bible/\">Is there an age of accountability in the Bible</a></strong>. &nbsp;I liked your explanation of the verses and the final answer to the question, however I am confused and worried about some of the scriptures and explanation that you gave about being saved! You are saying that&nbsp;God decides who gets saved and who doesn&#39;t? God gets to decide who goes to Heaven and who goes to Hell? Why don&#39;t we have free will?&nbsp; I thought that we were able to decide for ourselves if we wanted to follow, accept and love God?&nbsp;If God chooses Who is saved and who isn&#39;t, why would there be judgement and what&#39;s the point of living life on this earth if our lives are already decided before we were even born?<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t<strong>VBVM</strong>:</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe recognize the challenge of understanding the important and foundational truth of election (i.e., the Bibical truth of God&#39;s appointing some to salvation while passing over others). This core Biblical doctrine has been pushed aside in modern times, but it is the testimony of Scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tYour surprise at learning of this Biblical truth is not uncommon. Because many churches and pastors have rejected this truth or simply neglect to teach it properly, the doctrine of election (among other difficult truths of Scripture) has become unknown to many Christians, though it was the teaching of the Apostles and the accepted understanding of the church for many centuries.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn more recent times, false teachings concerning the nature and cause of salvation have supplanted the Biblical truth of election, most notably the claim that all men have \"free will\" to accept or reject the Gospel. To our untaught ears, such teaching sounds sensible, and so we accept it without questioning. Our false understanding will then be reinforced (and our hearts hardened to the truth) as we seek Biblical instruction only from those who reinforce our preferred views, perhaps preventing us from ever discovering the truth.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul taught that during later times we should expect to see a movement within the Church away from Biblical truth and toward preferred false teachings:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Tim. 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,<br />\n\t2Tim. 4:4 and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tRather than reinforcing such myths, our ministry is committed to teaching the truths of Scripture (even if they are unpopular), and the Biblical truth concerning salvation is that God chooses who will be saved.&nbsp; While men do have free will to make many decisions in life, when it comes to accepting the Gospel message, the Bible says there is no such thing as a man who willfully chooses to follow God or receive the Gospel.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, the term \"free will\" never appears in the Bible nor is there any such teaching in Scripture concerning salvation. On the contrary, Paul says in Romans:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 3:11 THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS,<br />\n\tTHERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;<br />\n\tRom. 3:12 ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS;<br />\n\tTHERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD,<br />\n\tTHERE IS NOT EVEN ONE.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Scriptures teach that because of Adam&#39;s fall in the Garden, all men are born spiritually dead and unable to obey a call to believe the Gospel. Our fallen spiritual nature is incapable of accepting \"the things of the Spirit,\" as Paul describes the Gospel. We are literally deaf to the Gospel message, as Paul teaches:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Cor. 2:14&nbsp; But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tLike all spiritual truth, the Gospel message can only be \"spiritually appraised,\" which means it can only be accepted as true by a living spirit. The fallen nature of man is incapable of understanding spiritual truth. Therefore, if God were to wait for men to choose Him, He would never receive a single convert! Paul says no man (or woman) seeks God, so no one would ever be saved. The barrier to belief in the Gospel is the dead spirit all men inherit at birth that cannot accept the things of God.</p>\n<p>\n\tSimply put, God MUST act first to give a person His living Spirit in order for the person to gain the capacity to respond to the Gospel and demonstrate saving faith, as Jesus taught:</p>\n<h5>\n\tJohn 6:65 And He was saying, &ldquo;For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThis is the very definition of grace: God acting on our behalf because we were incapable of acting for ourselves.&nbsp; As Paul taught in Ephesians:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 2:4 But God, being&nbsp; rich in mercy, because of&nbsp; His great love with which He loved us,<br />\n\tEph. 2:5 even when we were&nbsp; dead&nbsp; in our transgressions, made us alive together&nbsp; with Christ ( by grace you have been saved),<br />\n\tEph. 2:6 and&nbsp; raised us up with Him, and&nbsp; seated us with Him in&nbsp; the heavenly places in&nbsp; Christ Jesus,<br />\n\tEph. 2:7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing&nbsp; riches of His grace in&nbsp; kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tOur prideful, sinful nature prefers to believe that we are in control of every aspect of our lives, including over our decision to believe, but God desires to confront our pride and transform our understanding. By His word the Lord makes clear we were not a participant in our own salvation, even in the process of believing:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 2:8 For by grace you have been saved&nbsp; through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;<br />\n\tEph. 2:9&nbsp; not as a result of works, so that&nbsp; no one may boast.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe Bible teaches that even our faith itself was not something \"of ourselves\" but rather \"it is the gift of God.\" This truth offends our pride, because it removes our opportunity to boast (even a little) that we were acting sensibly when we \"chose\" to accept Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore over, we prefer to think that the one who refuses to accept the Gospel is simply \"getting what they deserve\" for their failure to believe the Gospel. By assigning responsibility for belief to each person (rather than to God), we comfort ourselves at the prospect that some spend eternity in Heaven while others spend eternity in punishment. We rationalize that this outcome is not God&#39;s \"fault\" since each person made a choice.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis viewpoint is not what Scripture teaches. Paul says this concerning the \"sensibility\" of believing the Gospel:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Cor. 1:21 For since in the wisdom of God&nbsp; the world through its wisdom did not come to know God,&nbsp; God was well-pleased through the&nbsp; foolishness of the&nbsp; message preached to&nbsp; save those who believe.<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:22 For indeed&nbsp; Jews ask for&nbsp; signs and Greeks search for wisdom;<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:23 but we preach&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ crucified,&nbsp; to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles&nbsp; foolishness,<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:24 but to those who are&nbsp; the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ&nbsp; the power of God and&nbsp; the wisdom of God.<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:25 Because the&nbsp; foolishness of God is wiser than men, and&nbsp; the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:26 &para; For&nbsp; consider your&nbsp; calling, brethren, that there were&nbsp; not many wise according to&nbsp; the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:27 but&nbsp; God has chosen the foolish things of&nbsp; the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of&nbsp; the world to shame the things which are strong,<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:28 and the base things of&nbsp; the world and the despised God has chosen,&nbsp; the things that are not, so that He may&nbsp; nullify the things that are,<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:29 so that&nbsp; no&nbsp; man may boast before God.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPaul says that by God&#39;s design the message of the cross (i.e., of the Gospel) is <strong><em>not</em></strong>&nbsp;sensible. It is foolishness to natural man. God has designed the message of grace so that natural man will be shamed by a reliance on wisdom to discover the truth about God. Paul says that by their \"wisdom,\" mankind will be shown to be fools and will not come to know God (v.21).</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead, those God calls (i.e., elects to faith) will accept the foolish message of the Gospel as their salvation by the power of God (v.24). The \"power of God\" is a reference to God&#39;s Spirit leading a man to agree with the foolish message of the Gospel. Therefore, God calls or elects some to salvation while leaving others to remain in their ignorance and sin. Though we prefer to think we chose Christ as our Savior, the truth is our Savior chose us before the foundations of the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tNaturally, we rebel at the notion that God is in control of every person&#39;s eternal destiny, and we assume (wrongly) that such a conclusion will make God to be unjust and unfair. We dismiss the possibility out of hand and then search for verses that will confirm our preferred view. Nevetheless, Scripture stands ready to debunk our false assumptions by presenting the truth concerning God&#39;s sovereignty.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Bible teaches that God made His decision concerning our salvation long ago:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 1:3&nbsp;&nbsp; Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in&nbsp; the heavenly places in Christ,<br />\n\tEph. 1:4 just as&nbsp; He chose us in Him before&nbsp; the foundation of the world, that we would be&nbsp; holy and blameless before&nbsp; Him.&nbsp; In love<br />\n\tEph. 1:5&nbsp; He&nbsp; predestined us to&nbsp; adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself,&nbsp; according to the&nbsp; kind intention of His will,<br />\n\tEph. 1:6&nbsp; to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in&nbsp; the Beloved.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tEven before the foundations of the Earth, the Lord had already chosen who would be \"in Him,\" meaning who would receive His grace. He&nbsp;determined that His elect would receive His mercy before they were ever born. He made this decision before the foundations of the earth so that His children could never claim that God&#39;s offer of mercy arrived on the basis of merit. We could never say we \"deserved\" or \"earned\" God&#39;s grace &ndash; or even that we were clever enough to believe in the Gospel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul uses the story of Jacob and Esau to explain that this principle has always been God&#39;s way:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 9:10&nbsp; And not only this, but there was&nbsp; Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac;<br />\n\tRom. 9:11 for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that&nbsp; God&rsquo;s purpose according to His choice would&nbsp; stand, not&nbsp; because of works but&nbsp; because of Him who calls,<br />\n\tRom. 9:12 it was said to her, &ldquo; THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.&rdquo;<br />\n\tRom. 9:13 Just as it is written, &ldquo; JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tBefore these two children were even born and before either had done anything good or bad, God&#39;s choice had been made, so that the world couldn&#39;t conclude that Jacob deserved or earned God&#39;s favor. Instead, Paul says God made His choice to love (i.e., chose) Jacob and hate (i.e., reject) Esau before they were born.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery Christian should contemplate this example carefully. Jacob&#39;s \"free will\" had nothing to do with God&#39;s choosing of him. Before the twins were born, God told Rebekah that He would choose Jacob (the younger) over Esau (the older). and Paul says God did this so men would later recognize that God assigned each son to his respective outcome apart from human decisions or merit.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid gives a similar testimony concerning his own salvation:</p>\n<h5>\n\tPsa. 22:9 &nbsp;Yet You are He who brought me forth from the womb;<br />\n\tYou made me trust when upon my mother&rsquo;s breasts.<br />\n\tPsa. 22:10 Upon You I was cast&nbsp; from&nbsp; birth;<br />\n\tYou have been my God from my mother&rsquo;s womb.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tDavid declares that God \"made\" him to trust God even as David was still nursing as an infant. In v.10 he repeats this truth: David was \"cast upon\" God from birth and that his relationship with God preceded even David&#39;s physical birth! How can we attribute David&#39;s salvation to a \"free will\" that chose God if his salvation occured in the womb? Similarly, Luke 1 tells the story of John the Baptist having been chosen by God while still in Elizabeth&#39;s womb.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese example prove the testimony of Scripture: God creates faith in our hearts by His sovereign choice, not through our intellectual understanding and agreement with the Gospel message. Whatever intellectual understanding we eventually obtain concerning our salvation and the grace of God (and some will gain greater understanding of it than others), our understanding of the Gospel will always <em>follow</em> the manifestation of God&#39;s grace in our life; it does not <em>produce</em> it.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding your question on why God has purposed this plan and not something else, remember that all creation exists for one purpose: to give glory to God. Therefore, God&#39;s design of the universe and His plan for salvation must be - by definition - the best possible way to glorify God.&nbsp; We can begin to understand how this is so when we consider God&#39;s possible alternatives.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, instead of saving some men, God could have chosen to save no one. Obviously, this option would not bring as much glory to God, since there would have been no one in eternity to praise the Lord for His mercy and grace.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, God could have chosen to save all men by grace and send no one to Hell. We naturally assume this would have been a better option, but though it may not make sense to us immediately, Paul teaches that this option actually brings God LESS glory. God would receive less glory in eternity would He have saved ALL men than were He to save only SOME men while passing over the rest and permitting them to perish justly in their sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul explains why this is true:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 9:22&nbsp; What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much&nbsp; patience vessels of wrath&nbsp; prepared for destruction?<br />\n\tRom. 9:23 And He did so to make known&nbsp; the riches of His glory upon&nbsp; vessels of mercy, which He&nbsp; prepared beforehand for glory,<br />\n\tRom. 9:24 even us, whom He also&nbsp; called,&nbsp; not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPaul says that even though God was willing to condemn all men to Hell (justly), for the sake of His glory He chose to appoint some men to salvation while assigning the rest to the destruction they deserve for their sin. By allowing both the elect and the nonelect to coexist into eternity, God furnished for His elect an essential contrast that allows us to understand and appreciate God&#39;s grace and give Him glory for it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, if God had chosen to save everyone, how could men ever fully appreciate what it means to receive His mercy? Naturally, men would have taken God&#39;s mercy for granted, since everyone received it. Men could never appreciate what it means to be saved if they lack an understanding of God&#39;s judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow could we write or sing the hymn \"Amazing Grace\" if not for our understanding of what it means to be saved from the penalty of sin? How would God receive praise for His Son&#39;s death in our place if we never stopped to consider that we might have received God&#39;s wrath instead? How could men appreciate that their sin deserves wrath from a holy and just God if no one was ever under the threat of such a judgment?</p>\n<p>\n\tIf God elected to save everyone, the effect would have been to cheapen mankind&#39;s appreciation of grace while diminishing the value of God&#39;s mercy. God would have appeared to have less glory in our eyes, because we would have known only part of God. We would have only know some aspects of God&#39;s character and nature rather than appreciating all of Who God is.</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead, God&#39;s plan of election ensures men know God fully, and by this plan, God receives the greatest glory.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/wrestling_with_god_part_2/\"><em>Continue to Part 2...</em></a></h4>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI live in Northwest Arkansas. As one visitor to the area asked, &ldquo;You get a whole corner?&rdquo; Yep. The region has become what some would describe as urban sprawl, only there is no real urban center. Unless you count the Walmart home office. But I digress.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you look at a map of the United States you will find us in the upper left hand corner of Arkansas. An hour from my driveway is the city center of Joplin, Missouri. If that doesn&rsquo;t spark an &ldquo;Ah-ha,\" let me remind you that in May of last year Joplin experienced the most devastating tornado in the nation&rsquo;s last six decades of weather record keeping. The monster was over a mile wide, scrubbed the ground for a staggering 38 minutes, destroying 8,000 structures and leaving 1,800 acres of land scoured.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen all the statistics were tallied, 160 were dead &ndash; many were children literally yanked from a parent&rsquo;s arms into the storm. The most frightening horror films ever made are those recorded by amateur videographers as they experienced the terror first-hand. It was an event that even from my cozy corner of relative safety will not soon be forgotten.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"none\" src=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/i/tim/2011/05/23/joplin_tornado_AP110523030192_540x405.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 352px; height: 283px; \" /></p>\n<p>\n\tOn Saturday I had an opportunity to go to Joplin with a friend of mine to drop her daughter at Missouri Southern after Christmas break. I was not one of the relief workers who headed to Joplin post-disaster, so this was my first look at what is now recovery. &nbsp;As we sat at a stop light, my friend pointed out a massive oak across the street that was the lone testimony to whatever stood on that square of ground, save a flat of concrete foundation. The tree had been debarked in a twisting pattern from the bottom of the trunk up to what was left of the branches. My friend said, &ldquo;It must have some strong roots.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tMaybe you understand. Maybe you haven&rsquo;t experienced a physical EF5 tornado, but you&rsquo;ve been left in the wreckage of an emotional storm. Maybe you&rsquo;re standing right now in the scraps of what was a prosperous life full of future hope. Maybe your body has been ravaged and scarred by a tempest of illness. Maybe you&rsquo;re turning in a circle trying to find a recognizable point on the landscape of your life, and coming up empty. You&rsquo;ve been debarked. The question is, are you still standing?</p>\n<p>\n\tStanding may not seem like such a great thing relatively speaking, but as I looked at that tree compared to the devastation around it &ndash; the <em>absence</em> around it &ndash; what I saw was survival, hope, fortitude, and the promise of a future. There wasn&rsquo;t much left, but by God it was still standing. And I mean, by God, and <em>only</em> by His strength.</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes we live through debarking and just stand there dazed by the experience, shocked beyond comprehension. But we&rsquo;re <em>standing</em>; roots dug down deep enough to not feel. Deep enough to hold firm. Deep enough to preserve life. There&rsquo;s not much left that&rsquo;s visible to the eye and what&rsquo;s there looks pitiful, but the roots are strong and we&#39;re still standing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tI could preach at you from the parable of the soils in Mark four, or allegorize the Root of Jesse. I could tell you that you should plant yourself in the Word, abide there and send down roots into streams of Living Water. I could remind you that the Word says that even from a stump, a tree can grow and bear fruit. But you should do that reading yourself. It will make your roots stronger. It will make you able to stand. It will preserve your life when the winds of destruction rage against you.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose roots will leave <em>you</em> as a testimony of survival, hope, fortitude, and the promise of a future. To those who can already see the clouds gathering on the horizon you will be a tribute to your roots. When there is nothing else left, live from the Root.&nbsp;</p>\n"

You can see from my profile picture that I typically wear it very short - have for years. Since Princess Diana made her first appearance on a magazine cover I&rsquo;ve had short hair. Now it almost covers my ears and is approaching what I would describe as the awkward stage, neither here nor there. I check every day to see if it&rsquo;s closing the gap on &ldquo;long&rdquo; but have to admit that it&rsquo;s now only short-ish.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;ve been equally frustrated of late with my spiritual growth. I have been as purposeful about growing in Christ as I was in deciding to let my hair grow, but I find the progress similarly slow-going and coming up short. Short on faith, short on love, short on long-suffering. Short on maturity. In times of small daily trials I am sure that I have closed the gap, and I walk away tossing my hair with joy. Then I get home and take a good look in the mirror and realize the truth that while there has been some progress, I&rsquo;m still short-ish compared to the goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is usually the point, when I have attempted to grow my hair in the past, where I give up and head to the salon. I just can&rsquo;t take it another minute. But I am determined and steadfast! Though it takes a million years, I will have chin-length hair! And though my spiritual life is still an untamed, unruly mess, I will stay in the grip of my God who will lead me long-distance to my long-range longing of being a long-standing, long-suffering, long-lived (although long-winded) Saint, because He is not longitudinally challenged! I will have no shortage of success because God is not in short-supply of grace and is not short-handed, short-sighted nor short-lived. Though He will not short-change me, there is no short-cut to victory. And that is the long and short of things.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.

The report gives a nice summary of how our ministry put your donations to work in fulfilling our mission of teaching and distributing God&#39;s word. I encourage you to download his report and read the details. In addition to the link above, you can find the report on the <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/about/financial_support/\"><strong>Financial Support</strong></a> page of our website.</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking back on 2011, our ministry was most certainly blessed by the Lord with the opportunity to reach even more people with the word of God. We grew our audience and our reach, which was especially gratifying in a difficult economic climate and despite a slight drop in donations. By devoting nearly 90% of our revenue to the development and distribution of our teaching, we ensured our library of sound Biblical instruction continued to grow, so that by the end of 2011, our website offered students nearly 250 written articles and over 500 audio lessons teaching the Bible verse-by-verse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond adding new material, the minsitry also made an important decision in 2011 to revisit some of our existing Bible classes, specifically our foundational&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/genesis_2011/\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/\">Revelation</a>&nbsp;</strong>courses. The new classes have been re-written from the ground up and include much more material, new written notes and in the case of Revelation, overhead slides to compliment the teaching. Both classes started in 2011 and will finish in mid-2012, at which point I will move to new studies in the Old and New Testament.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn early 2012, my teaching and traveling pace will pick up considerably.&nbsp;In addition to starting back with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/events/genesis_2011/\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a>&nbsp;in Austin, Texas, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/events/revelation_2011/\"><strong>Revelation</strong></a>&nbsp;in San Antonio, Texas, I will be preaching in Colorado in early January and Costa Rica in mid-January. &nbsp;If you live near Colorado Springs, Colorado, please join me at 7:00 PM on January 5th at <a href=\"http://www.lcflasvegas.org/contentpages.aspx?parentnavigationid=4272&amp;viewcontentpageguid=5000ccb9-8eb4-4be9-874b-304ffabb3706\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Underground Church</strong></a>&nbsp;and again on January 6th at 7:00 PM at the <strong><a href=\"http://www.lcflasvegas.org/contentpages.aspx?parentnavigationid=4272&amp;viewcontentpageguid=efebfd1d-021d-49be-ba1d-cacdcb669d30\" target=\"_blank\">Lighthouse Christian Fellowship</a>.</strong>&nbsp;For everyone else, we&#39;ll post my teaching from these events on the website later this month.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we begin another year serving our Lord through the teaching of His word, I thank everyone who supports the work of Verse By Verse Ministry, whether through prayers, financial support, volunteer efforts, encouraging letters, personal visits &ndash; or all of the above!

Scripture defines sin as &ldquo;missing the goal or path of right and duty&rdquo;, &ldquo;to incur guilt, penalty&rdquo;, &ldquo;to miss the mark&rdquo;, \"to wander from the law of God, violate God&rsquo;s law.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tPart of Strauss-Kahn&rsquo;s confession is correct; namely, he did indeed exhibit moral weakness.&nbsp; To say what he did was an &ldquo;error&rdquo; is also correct, for an error is &ldquo;a deviation from accuracy or correctness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even calling what he did a mistake is accurate, for this literally means &ldquo;to take in error&rdquo;, &ldquo;an error in judgment caused by poor reasoning, carelessness, or insufficient knowledge.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tNow, I&rsquo;m not picking on Dominique Strauss-Kahn.&nbsp; Sin is a trait shared by all humans since the Fall of Adam.&nbsp; However, while his admission of guilt may be technically accurate, the connotations of those words are not exactly the same as calling it sin.&nbsp; The world does not like the term &ldquo;sin&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s much too personal.&nbsp; To say I made a mistake, or made an error has the connotation that it&rsquo;s harmless, that no one is perfect.&nbsp; And all of this is true, except that errors and mistakes typically don&rsquo;t imply that eternal damnation awaits those who made the errors and mistakes.&nbsp; There may be consequences in our human relationships, as his admission above shows, but errors and mistakes don&rsquo;t imply consequences in our relationship with God.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been well said that we ALL have a relationship with God.&nbsp; We will either be blessed by His eternal presence or be cursed by His eternal damnation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSin, on the other hand, does imply damnation.&nbsp; If anyone has broken God&rsquo;s law, missed the mark, missed the path of right and duty, and if God is a holy and just God (and He is), then there must be punishment for the lawbreakers.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re all guilty of not calling our sins sin, because to do so acknowledges the existence of God, and the consequence of sin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThankfully, the Lord provides a way for us to be reconciled to Him.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as simple as acknowledging that we are sinners and asking for His mercy.&nbsp; James 4:6 tells us that &ldquo;<em>GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jesus demonstrated these attributes of God in the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector in Luke 18:9-14:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;<em>9 And He also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt:&nbsp; 10 &ldquo;Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.&nbsp; 11 The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself:&nbsp; &lsquo;God, I thank You that I am not like other people:&nbsp; swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.&nbsp; 12 I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I get.&rsquo;&nbsp; 13 But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, &lsquo;God, be merciful to me, the sinner!&rsquo;&nbsp; 14 I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThanks be to God for pouring out His mercy on us who believe.&nbsp; Let us pray for those who do not believe.&nbsp; For it is in Christ alone that a person is justified.&nbsp; If your relationship with God is defined by faith in His Son, then you will be blessed by God&rsquo;s presence for all eternity.&nbsp; If you do not believe, you are condemned for all eternity.&nbsp; The first time Christ came into the world was not to judge it, but to save it.&nbsp; John 3:16-21 makes this clear:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&ldquo;<em>16 &ldquo;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.&nbsp; 17 For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.&nbsp; 18 He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.&nbsp; 19 This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil.&nbsp; 20 For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.&nbsp; 21 But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tLet&rsquo;s pray for those who do not believe, and behave as those whose deeds may be seen as having been wrought in God.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI watched one of those news specials years ago that was running an episode about salmonella contamination. It followed a woman with a package of chicken from the grocery store to her home. After she got the package into the freezer they revealed with ultraviolet light where there was trace amounts of chicken juice in her kitchen. The place lit up like Disney World at Christmas time. Chicken juice on the counter, on the faucets, on the light switch, on the freezer door handle. There was even chicken juice on her daughter&rsquo;s face. Eww.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I&rsquo;ve gotten older I&rsquo;ve gotten more germaphobic, and chicken juice tops my list of disgusting contaminants, even though its potential salmonella is technically not a germ. When I handle chicken in my kitchen I have the chicken in one hand and a gallon of bleach in the other. Every germaphobe knows that a simple swipe of the counter with the dish-cloth only spreads the juice around &ndash; it takes bleach to wipe it out.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there I was at my kitchen sink while preparing dinner, trying to figure exactly what I had touched with chicken-juicy hands when it hit me. You can&rsquo;t see it. It contaminates everything it touches. You can&rsquo;t casually take a swipe at it and forget it. It&rsquo;s gross. It&rsquo;ll kill you if you don&rsquo;t deal with it correctly. Only two things can handle it &ndash; fire or bleach. It&#39;s sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Bible mentions bleach actually. Mark writes <em>&ldquo;His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.&rdquo; </em>describing Jesus during his transfiguration. (Mark 9:3) But the verse that sticks out to me when I think of bleach is this one, <em>\"These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb&rdquo;.</em> (Revelation 7:14) And these, <em>&ldquo;I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and makes war. His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself. He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God. The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean.&rdquo; </em>(Revelation 19:11-14)<br />\n\t<br />\n\tNow I don&rsquo;t pretend to know one blessed thing about the book of Revelation beyond what I can read on the surface, (you&rsquo;ll have to click over to Pastor Armstrong&rsquo;s fine teaching on Revelation for more than that!) but did you ever wonder why Jesus&rsquo; robe is stained with blood but the armies of heaven wore fine linen, white and clean? Bleach. Holy bleach. Blood of Christ bleach. The only true stain remover. And the only way Jesus could get us clean was to contaminate Himself. He waded through that nasty chicken juice so we could be clean and holy, spotless and white. Bleached before a holy God.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that fire I mentioned earlier? Well, &ldquo;<em>If anyone&#39;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.&rdquo;</em> (Revelation 20:15) Fire purifies as well, but sometimes the damage is done before the fat hits the pan. I don&rsquo;t mean that to minimize the tragedy, but the choice is truly that simple. Bleach or fire.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext time you get that chicken out to thaw on your counter (we all do it&hellip;don&rsquo;t pretend you don&rsquo;t!) thank Jesus for His holy work that makes us too, whiter than anything in this world could bleach us. Never thought you&rsquo;d be grateful for chicken juice, now did you?</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s the Christmas season and I will soon be baking for my neighbors. It&rsquo;s my gift to them at Christmas time.&nbsp; What I bake takes a different twist every year. This year I&rsquo;m thinking about bread. I love bread in every shape, size and flavor. Pumpernickel, sourdough, whole wheat, rye. Hard and crusty, tough and chewy, airy and soft; there isn&rsquo;t a bread I&rsquo;ve met that I don&rsquo;t love. In fact, I think I could actually live on bread alone, with all due respect to the Lord&rsquo;s wisdom. That&rsquo;s why my reading today struck me so profoundly.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn John 6 Jesus teaches about bread. He is the bread of life. We must consume His body in order to live.&nbsp; Many of the disciples listening to Jesus were offended by his teaching, and I understand all the reasons why His words offended their Jewish minds, but it gave me pause to ask myself if I would be offended if someone offered me good bread to eat. Would I pass it up under any circumstances? I think not! Slather it thick with butter and pour some honey on it!</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, though I am as busy as the next mom at this time of year, I have yet to forget to eat. I mean to feed my physical body. If you know me you know that I don&rsquo;t miss a meal! But honestly, my quiet time often takes a back seat to, well, everything else that is pressing in on me from the refrigerator calendar. Dates and deadlines leer at me from across the room driving me from my chair and into action. I know that, spiritually speaking, I&rsquo;m starving myself to death and wasting away, but I can&rsquo;t seem to take time to eat the Bread that has come down from heaven - and you wouldn&#39;t like me when I&rsquo;m hungry (picture the Hulk here!).</p>\n<p>\n\tIf I were to be completely honest, I would have to admit that this problem is not limited to the Christmas season. It is often a struggle to get myself in that kitchen chair with the Bread of Life open before me, knife and fork in hand, ready to be fed. Why does it offend me so to have to take the time to eat? I make time for every other meal without hesitation, though I may gulp it down from a paper bag en route to the next pressing commitment. Even that sack of empty calories is enough to keep me functioning for the next couple of hours, and I paid good money for it too!</p>\n<p>\n\tYou get the point. It&rsquo;s an old old story. I&rsquo;m not here to lay on a guilt trip, but I would like to ask a collective question. Are you hungry? Jesus talked about eternal life beginning with the Bread of Life and maybe you&rsquo;ve got that eternity thing sewn up. But eternity begins for the believer today. Today is a part of your eternity. Are you rushing around in your eternity unfed? Think about what you&rsquo;re like when you&rsquo;ve missed a physical meal. Got the picture? It looks the same spiritually.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tStop right now and open up that 100 calorie snack pack and get some fuel for your day. Maybe it isn&rsquo;t a whole meal - you can get that later - but give yourself something to go on for the next couple of hours. Then recharge when you begin to feel depleted, exhausted, and run down. (Or run over!!) If you have time to feed your body, you have time to feed your soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Jesus answered, \"It is written: &#39;Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.&#39;\"</em>&nbsp; Matthew 4:4<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tOne of the key doctrines of Christianity is that man is fallen.&nbsp; That is, man is spiritually dead.&nbsp; This is not to say that all men are as bad as they can be (obviously, some are more evil than others), just that man is not inherently good.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tContrast this with the world&rsquo;s belief that man is generally good.&nbsp; Oh sure, some men are evil, but inside of everyone is a basic goodness that we all have.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThat man is fallen and not good is obvious to all who simply pay attention.&nbsp; Along those lines, I like to point these things out as they are manifest in our culture.&nbsp; A recent example involves Big Macs.&nbsp; Yes, the burger sold by McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWhat does a burger have to do with man&rsquo;s fallenness?&nbsp; Well, nothing per se.&nbsp; However, it turns out that the magazine the Economist has a Big Mac index which they use to compare prices of the popular burger in cities across the globe.&nbsp; While not perfect, it&rsquo;s a measure to determine if one currency (e.g., the U.S. dollar) is at parity (equal value) with another currency (e.g., the British pound).&nbsp; So, if a Big Mac costs about $4 in New York City, it should cost about the same in London if the currency exchange rates are at parity.&nbsp; So, if the GBP/U.S. $ exchange rate is 0.65 GBP/1 USD, then a Big Mac in London should cost about GBP2.58.&nbsp; Got that?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWell, even if you don&rsquo;t, this has more to do with man&rsquo;s fallenness than currency exchange rates.&nbsp; This example happens to be in Argentina.&nbsp; Right now, the country&#39;s economy is growing, but, as the New York Times reports, they also have a very high rate of inflation.&nbsp; One way government officials have sought to hide this inflation is by suppressing the true price of a Big Mac, or at least so it seems.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAs the Times reports, when you look at a menu behind the counter in an Argentinean Mickey D&rsquo;s, the popular Big Mac is missing.&nbsp; It can be found on a price list &ldquo;down the hall toward the bathroom&rdquo;, and the Big Mac is near the bottom of the price list.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWhy?&nbsp; Because the price of the Big Mac is 21.90 pesos ($5.14), much less than a Quarter Pounder with Cheese for 32.50 pesos ($7.60).&nbsp; Since Big Macs cost more than the Quarter Pounder, it should sell for more.&nbsp; However, because the Big Mac is included in the Economist&rsquo;s Big Mac index, the government presumably pressures McDonald&rsquo;s to keep the price down.&nbsp; This is probably true; why else would McDonald&rsquo;s keep the Big Mac off the main menu?&nbsp; According to the Times, the Economist estimates that the true rate of burger inflation is 19%, almost double what the government reports.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tOnce again, the truth of Scripture is made manifest.&nbsp; Romans 3:4 says, &ldquo;<em>Rather, let God be found true, though every man be found a liar, as it is written, &ldquo;THAT YOU MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN YOUR WORDS, AND PREVAIL WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED</em>.&rdquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover, if government officials will lie about the price of a burger, a relatively minor thing, what else might they lie about?&nbsp; Jesus said, &ldquo;<em>He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much</em>.&rdquo; (Luke 16:10)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tOf course, this is a human condition, not an Argentinean condition.&nbsp; Keep your eyes open, as God&rsquo;s word is proven daily.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>A friend of mine named Robert and I recently got together for lunch.&nbsp; Robert had passed along a link to a CNN.com article entitled &ldquo;<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/10/26/coogan.bible.family.values/index.html?iref=obinsite\">Bible has some shocking &lsquo;family values&#39;</a>&rdquo; and wanted some help answering the claims that were made in it.&nbsp; He wanted to provide a good, solid, Biblical response to his brother-in-law who had sent it to him.&nbsp; This is the second part of our discussion which <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/diminishing_the_work_of_messiah_part_1/\">began in an earlier article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Scripture promotes slavery?</h2>\n\n<p>We went back to the article&hellip;</p>\n\n<h5><em>According to biblical law, a father could sell his daughter as a slave, and the last of the Ten Commandments lists as off-limits a neighbor&rsquo;s possessions &mdash; his house, wife, slaves, and livestock.&nbsp; But the majority of modern Jews and Christians no longer accept the biblical view of women as men&rsquo;s property and hence subordinate to them, as they have also abandoned the biblical practice of polygamy.</em></h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This one&rsquo;s tough because he&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Robert said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we have abandoned a few of G-d&rsquo;s standards from the Bible because we live in a different culture then what&rsquo;s to keep us from abandoning <strong>more </strong>of them&hellip; or <strong>all </strong>of them?&nbsp; In his letter to Titus, Paul tells people who are slaves to remain as slaves and be subject to their masters in everything.&nbsp; How can I respond to my brother-in-law about this?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as tough as you would think,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;First off, in most places where the Bible mentions slavery it is not describing the types of horrid conditions that most Americans think about that occurred in the 1800&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If I were to have sold myself in Bible times as an indentured servant/slave then my master would be responsible for feeding, clothing, and sheltering me.&nbsp; If I were destitute and had no food or shelter then servitude would be an improvement to my situation, right?&nbsp; There is also a fixed period of time for my servitude and if I earn enough from my service then I could actually shorten that period.&nbsp; There were also stiff penalties for a master mistreating his slaves so Biblical slavery was a much better situation than what we normally think of as slavery.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Biblical slavery was not too much different from getting a car loan today.&nbsp; I agree to work and earn enough money to pay back the amount I borrowed from the bank.&nbsp; The primary differences are that the bank doesn&rsquo;t have to feed, clothe, or shelter me nor are they responsible for employing me to enable me to pay back the loan.</p>\n\n<p>I grinned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Okay&hellip;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m exaggerating a lot there but you get my point.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Secondly, the Bible never actually <strong>commands </strong>people to be involved in slavery.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t tell the father that he <strong>has to</strong> sell his daughter as a slave.&nbsp; The Bible simply sees this situation and says &lsquo;look, if a family is so poor that a father feels he has to put his daughter in a situation where she would be fed, clothed, and sheltered then there are certain protections that must be in place to safeguard the girl.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not as if people were having babies and selling them on the slave market as their family business.&nbsp; This horrible situation was much like what happens today when parents are unable to care adequately for their child and they put her up for adoption.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Rather than promoting slavery, the commandments are a reflection of G-d&rsquo;s mercy and grace towards humanity in the midst of terrible circumstances.&nbsp; The laws and the cultural standards of America prohibit slavery so the commandments given in Scripture simply don&rsquo;t need to be brought to bear on our lives.&nbsp; If everybody stopped driving and started walking then the laws that govern the operations of motor vehicles simply wouldn&rsquo;t be relevant to us.&nbsp; The law doesn&rsquo;t <strong>require you </strong>to drive a car, right?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Robert shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I see your point but how can we still uphold the prohibition against homosexuality when we don&rsquo;t maintain the Biblical laws regarding slavery?&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t abandoning one mean that we have to abandon the other?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Let me put it this way,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a rule in my house for visiting children that says &lsquo;do not go into the study.&rsquo;&nbsp; The room is not child safe and has some very breakable things in it so children are not allowed.&nbsp; I also have a rule that says &lsquo;if you come in my house you should take off your shoes.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is a difference between the way these rules are structured.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One rule says do not do &lsquo;x&rsquo;.&nbsp; Period.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The other rule says<strong> if </strong>you &lsquo;a&rsquo; then you must also do &lsquo;b&rsquo; as well.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The commandment against homosexuality is the first type of rule.&nbsp; The commandment regarding slavery is the second kind of rule.&nbsp; Since we don&rsquo;t do &lsquo;a&rsquo; then &lsquo;b&rsquo; is not required but that doesn&rsquo;t change the prohibition against &lsquo;x&rsquo;.&nbsp; Does that make sense?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This time Robert nodded his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I get it.&nbsp; The rules for slavery only apply when slavery exists.&nbsp; If we aren&rsquo;t involved in slavery then the rules for it do not apply.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it&rdquo;, I said with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is the biggest issue I have with all of this.&nbsp; If anyone says the commandments in the Bible are simply the common moral standards during Bible times and they are not G-d&rsquo;s standards then they diminish Messiah and His work.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Diminishing the Messiah and His work</h2>\n\n<p>&ldquo;If I were to take a Bible and literally cut out the passages that are &lsquo;just commonly held standards&rsquo; (as the CNN article claims) then I would be physically diminishing the contents of that Bible, right?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Robert nodded.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In a similar way the author of that article diminishes the Word of G-d by saying, &lsquo;these aren&rsquo;t really G-d&rsquo;s standards&rsquo;.&nbsp; If he diminishes the Word of G-d (that same Word that became flesh and dwelled among us as John chapter 1 tells us) then he is also diminishing Messiah.&nbsp; Such thinking also diminishes the <strong>work </strong>of Messiah.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;If these are not G-d&rsquo;s standards by which He will judge all humanity then humanity hasn&rsquo;t sinned and doesn&rsquo;t need a redeemer: we don&rsquo;t need the Messiah.&nbsp; Even if somebody says only <strong>some </strong>of them are G-d&rsquo;s standards and not <strong>all </strong>of them then Messiah&rsquo;s work is diminished.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe that Messiah came and died for us because of a few trivial sins.&nbsp; Paul actually says that G-d&rsquo;s commandments were given so that sin would become utterly sinful.&nbsp; This <strong>magnifies </strong>the work of Messiah rather than diminishing it.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Let me give you an example.&nbsp; If I pay your debt by buying your lunch then I have blessed you in some small measure.&nbsp; If I pay off your car loan, however, then the measure of what I have done is far greater and if I pay off your mortgage then it is greater still.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Robert grinned and I said with a laugh, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get any ideas, buddy.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re still buying lunch.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Speaking of lunch,&rdquo; Robert said as the waiter arrived at our table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one last quote I wanted to mention from the CNN article.</p>\n\n<h5><em>&hellip; it is time to recognize that the values of the biblical writers are no longer necessarily our own.</em></h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I shook my head sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It appears that many people in the world are taking that position more and more often but I know those who believe in G-d and cling to Him will choose the values and the standards that He has expressed in His Word.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Robert said, &ldquo;Amen!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s give thanks and eat.&nbsp; Father in heaven, we thank You for Your Word and the truths it contains and for Your Son, the Messiah who has redeemed us&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI had a moment of self-awareness yesterday. I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that I am not a good decision maker. It isn&rsquo;t that I can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t make a decision, but rather that I make really poor decisions. Even in the minor things, I can&rsquo;t really seem to ever get it right. My life verse ought to be Proverbs 14:12 which says, &ldquo;<em>There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tOK, so maybe my decisions haven&rsquo;t led to anyone&rsquo;s death yet, at least not physically, but they have led to cooking in cashmere. Tonight I decided to make chicken pot pie from scratch. When I dressed this morning it was cool-ish and I chose a cashmere (Don&rsquo;t be impressed. It came from the Goodwill and cost $4.00.) cardigan over a t-shirt. In the moment, that was a wise decision that meant I didn&rsquo;t need a coat when I was running errands. But as the day progressed and got warmer, and as I heated&nbsp;my oven to 400 degrees, and as I boiled chicken, made gravy and rolled pie dough, that earlier decision seemed less wise, leading, in fact, to sweltering sweat. And even after my epiphany moment yesterday, I still found myself today contemplating the removal of pie dough from a fuzzy sweater.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy didn&rsquo;t I simply take the sweater off? Well, you see, that&rsquo;s just the problem!&nbsp; These things just don&rsquo;t occur to me until I&rsquo;m up to my elbows in flour. Or, if they occur to me at all, I think there&rsquo;s a work-around, and I delay what I know I ought to do until it&rsquo;s too late to do it or I&rsquo;m committed to another itinerary.&nbsp; Sometimes it occurs to me to seek wisdom from other sources, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I know what they&rsquo;re going to suggest, and it&rsquo;s not really what I want to do, so I simply stay-the-course. Now <em>that&rsquo;s </em>some poor decision making! In those moments when I&rsquo;m genuinely just too busy to listen, I wish the Holy Spirit would get louder. That&rsquo;s what I do with my 14 year old when he&rsquo;s not listening. It usually works, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure it would work for me too.</p>\n<p>\n\tDid you think God isn&rsquo;t concerned about fuzzy cashmere sweaters, and wouldn&rsquo;t have much to say about that anyway? Well we could talk about that at length, but I&rsquo;ll let the Master tell you this much, &ldquo;<em>I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. This is to my Father&rsquo;s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples</em>&rdquo;. I know you caught that part where He said, &ldquo;&hellip;<em>apart from me you can do nothing</em>&rdquo; and yes, I believe that includes making wise decisions about apparel. He also got the withering and burning right which I learned as a result of choosing to cook in cashmere.</p>\n<p>\n\tI joke, but this is truly one of the things I know God wants me to begin to understand. Nothing means nothing. I can do nothing. No thing. I have no wisdom. I have no understanding. Apart from Him, I&rsquo;m&hellip;me, cooking in cashmere,&nbsp;a sweltering fool who didn&rsquo;t have sense enough to ask for wisdom.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;<em>He who trusts in himself is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom is kept safe</em>.&rdquo; Proverbs 28:26</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>A friend of mine named Robert and I recently got together for lunch.&nbsp; Robert had passed along a link to a CNN.com article entitled &ldquo;<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/10/26/coogan.bible.family.values/index.html?iref=obinsite\">Bible has some shocking &lsquo;family values&#39;</a>&rdquo; and wanted some help answering the claims that were made in it.&nbsp; He wanted to provide a good, solid, Biblical response to his brother-in-law who had sent it to him.</p>\n\n<p>Once we had ordered lunch, we got down to business.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The guy who wrote the article, Michael Coogan, makes three claims that we should discuss&rdquo;, I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start at the top.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>G-d is not the author of Scripture</h2>\n\n<p>I read the first part of the article out loud.</p>\n\n<h5><em>When talking about so-called family values, pastors, popes, and politicians routinely quote the Bible as if it were an unassailable divine authority &mdash; after all, they assume, God wrote the Bible, and therefore it is absolutely and literally true.</em></h5>\n\n<h5><em>But that is a misconception.&nbsp; As the Bible itself makes clear, its authors were human beings, many of whom are named: David, Isaiah, Luke, and Paul.</em></h5>\n\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;First off, Coogan claims that G-d is not the author of Scripture&rdquo;, I said.&nbsp; &rdquo;If by &lsquo;author&rsquo; he means &lsquo;the person who took a pen and wrote all the words of the Bible in a scroll&rsquo; then he is correct.&nbsp; Over three dozen Jewish men (Moses, Joshua, David, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Matthew, John, Peter, Paul, etc.) wrote the words that we call &lsquo;The Bible&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Robert had a funny look on his face so I stopped and asked, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Are you telling me that the entire Bible, front to back, was written by Jews?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Why, is that surprising?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It is.&nbsp; I guess I never really thought of the Bible as a Jewish book&rdquo;, he said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well, technically, it&rsquo;s <strong>G-d&rsquo;s </strong>book.&nbsp; G-d did, however, chose Jewish men as the means to deliver its message to humanity.&nbsp; Israel is very special to G-d.&nbsp; In the book of Romans, Paul actually mentions that there are many great benefits of being a Jew and the first thing on his list was that they were &lsquo;entrusted with the oracles of G-d.&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In actual fact, there is only a single instance mentioned in Scripture where G-d, himself, literally &lsquo;wrote&rsquo; the words found in the Bible:</p>\n\n<p><em>When He had finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, He gave Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.</em>&nbsp; (Exodus 31:18)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what Coogan is talking about, though&rdquo;, I said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;No, I think by &lsquo;author&rsquo; he means &lsquo;the source&rsquo; or &lsquo;the originator&rsquo; of Scripture.&nbsp; I think he is dead wrong and this part of his article I can answer&rdquo;, Robert said confidently.</p>\n\n<p>He continued, &ldquo;At Mt Sinai, with over a million witnesses present, G-d spoke the Ten Commandments to the nation of Israel.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><em>Then <strong>God spoke all these words</strong>, saying, &ldquo;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.&nbsp; You shall have no other gods before Me&hellip;&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; (Exodus 20:1-3)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Robert chuckled.&nbsp; &ldquo;If G-d had not spoken these words or if they were incorrectly recorded in Scripture then surely somebody would have pointed out the error to Moses!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&rdquo;, I said.&nbsp; &rdquo;There are over 50 passages in the Bible that begin with the phrase &lsquo;<em>Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying&hellip;</em>&rsquo;.&nbsp; These are simply transcriptions of the exact words that G-d spoke to Moses.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Consider this analogy.&nbsp; If an executive dictated a letter to his assistant (who recorded it verbatim), nobody would claim that those were the words of the assistant.&nbsp; Everyone would recognize that the executive was the source of the message.&nbsp; Coogan, however, is claiming it was the assistant who wrote it!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Robert smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good analogy.&nbsp; For those types of passages, it entirely makes sense but most of the Bible isn&rsquo;t simply a transcription, right?&nbsp; The vast majority of Scripture was inspired and I had a verse in mind that supports that understanding.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><em>All Scripture is <strong>God-breathed </strong>and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.</em>&nbsp; (2 Timothy 3:16-17 NIV)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That is a&nbsp; great example,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Consider this verse, too.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and <strong>the Word was God</strong>.&nbsp; He was in the beginning with God.&nbsp; </em>(John 1:1-2)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In their original languages, the written words of Scripture that we have today are G-d&rsquo;s expression of <strong>Himself </strong>into this world.&nbsp; G-d is so unique, so rare, and so absolutely <em><strong>other </strong></em>that He had to express Himself to us in our terms so that we could even begin to comprehend the tiniest bit of Who He Is and what He desires for us.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Robert nodded and agreed, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Scripture is so important to believers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>We paused for a minute while the waiter refilled our glasses and then moved on to the next claim from the article.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>G-d&rsquo;s Law is merely a reflection of shared cultural values</h2>\n\n<p>We read the next few paragraphs from the CNN.com article together.</p>\n\n<h5><em>These human writers wrote over the course of more than a thousand years, and their writings reflect their own views and the values they shared with their contemporaries.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s not surprising that inconsistencies are frequent in the Bible, both trivial and profound.</em></h5>\n\n<h5><em>Opponents of same-sex marriage cite Leviticus, which says that when a man sleeps with a man as with a woman it is an abomination.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re right: It does say that.&nbsp; But it later calls for the death penalty for such activity, which only the most rabid opponents would insist on.&nbsp; The Bible also calls eating pork and a woman wearing a man&rsquo;s clothes abominations, yet many would no longer enforce such prohibitions.&nbsp;</em> [Ed: after our article was written this last paragraph has since disappeared from the original CNN web page.]</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We pulled up our Bible apps on our phones so we could see what Leviticus actually says.</p>\n\n<p><em>You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.&nbsp; </em>(Leviticus 18:22)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; said Robert.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it says.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I pointed out, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the important part, though.&nbsp; Go to the very first verse of that chapter.&nbsp; What does it say?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Robert read it out loud:</p>\n\n<p><em>Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying&hellip;&nbsp; </em>(Leviticus 18:1)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The article claims &lsquo;These human writers wrote over the course of more than a thousand years, and their writings reflect their<strong> own views </strong>and<strong> the values they shared with their contemporaries</strong>.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Coogan&rsquo;s estimation G-d did <strong>not </strong>really say that.&nbsp; The prohibition against homosexuality was just part of the values Moses &lsquo;shared with his contemporaries&rsquo;.&nbsp; In making such a statement, Coogan is calling Moses a liar and uses the exact same tactic as the serpent in the Garden of Eden: &lsquo;Has G-d really said&hellip;?&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Robert shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;So either the Bible is true and<strong> G-d said </strong>homosexuality is an abomination to Him or the Bible is false and <strong>Moses said </strong>homosexuality is an abomination because that was the standard in his culture.&nbsp; I know what my choice is between those two options!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Robert then got that same slightly confused look on his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what about the other points he makes?&nbsp; You know&hellip; the part about eating pork and cross dressing being abominations to G-d?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Personally speaking, I agree with what the Bible says and think those are abominations in G-d&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; That can get into a really long discussion, however, so we&rsquo;ll have to save that for another time,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move on to the next point so we can finish before lunch arrives.&nbsp; I think it was the primary point of the CNN article anyway.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/diminishing_the_work_of_messiah_part_2/\">Continue reading the conclusion of our conversation<em>.</em></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+BradyStephenson_TX?rel=author\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">Brady on Google Plus</a></p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI had my eye exam recently. I was only a year late. The last time I was there the doctor asked me, &ldquo;Can you see anything out of your left eye?!&rdquo; The answer is yes, but barely. For one thing, there is a big mysterious scar through my field of vision on that eyeball, and that eye has always been the weaker of my two orbs of perspective. For those of you who understand lens prescriptions, my new lenses are +4.25, -1.75, xo65 add .75 on the left and just +1.50 add .75 on the right. In other words&hellip;I can&rsquo;t really see much out of my left eye. Go figure. According to the optician who handled me when I tried on my new specs, I have an odd prescription. She warned me about my depth perception. Ya think?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe thing I wanted to think about today with regard to my eyes began with the doctor&rsquo;s odd question, &ldquo;Which eye do you use the most?&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that weird? I answered by saying. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Generally speaking, I use them both.&rdquo; I mean, truly, when one eye is open, isn&rsquo;t the other one?? Am I alone here? And let&rsquo;s face it, if there is anyone in the world who might be likely to use one eye predominantly it might be someone with my lens prescription. But I would have to say with absolute certainty that 99% of the time if my right eyelid is up, so is the left one.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that begs a question. What exactly do I see out of that poor, old, scarred, oddly-misshapen left eyeball? Well, I see the world with some distortions. Have you ever noticed that when you have to drive in the rain for any length of time your eyes get really tired? It&rsquo;s because your eyes are trying to alternate between what they see close up on your windshield when it&rsquo;s rain covered, and what they see at a distance beyond the windshield once your wipers have cleared the glass. If you have ever had the opportunity to sit in your car and wait for someone while it&rsquo;s raining, you know that you can hardly stand to not run the wipers because your eyes don&rsquo;t know how to focus on the rain washed windshield. If I had to explain to you what I see through my left eye without my glasses, that&rsquo;s the best description I can give you. Unfocused. Uncomfortable. Seeing, but unseeing. Shapes without details. Wavy, watery distortions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy right eye, on the other hand, aside from the degeneration of age, is mostly pulling its weight. Even without my glasses I could function pretty well and see pretty clearly, though it would induce a bit of strain after a while.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what does this have to do with anything? Well, as I&rsquo;ve given this some thought I have realized that it works pretty well to explain how some of us see life after our salvation. (Especially if you came late to the party, like I did.) We&rsquo;ve got one eye that&rsquo;s totally whack, and one eye that now sees pretty clearly, though it requires some effort (and possibly a headache). It might also help some of you who have to deal with the likes of me to be patient and realize that sometimes we do subconsciously use one eye more than the other. Sometimes we might need you to hand us our specs&nbsp;and tell us to focus.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs an application, my left eye is badly scarred, as is my life. There is a lumpy layer of flesh that had previously been flayed violently but has now healed. The nature of a scar is lost feeling; it&rsquo;s no longer sore, but now it feels nothing at all. It&rsquo;s tough. It&rsquo;s thick. It&rsquo;s unfeeling. It&rsquo;s insensitive. It&rsquo;s protective of that now hidden wound, and it runs through my field of vision, so to speak.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy left eye, having astigmatism, is deformed just as my life is. As I grew, I was shaped by people, circumstances, and information-input that molded me like a lump of clay and twisted the way I receive influence so that it misses the mark of true vision. In other words, my information receptor is way off center.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I age, the additional insult to my poor left-eye vision, is that I can no longer see clearly up close and personal. Maybe in life I have just gotten more self- protective and want to keep others at arm&rsquo;s length (or further). The scars and the continual miscommunication have just worn me out and I&rsquo;d rather keep you way out there so I can avoid the strain of having you closer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tBy contrast, my right eye is the Spiritual guide to my life. Through it, I see more clearly. I focus on-point and receive information as it is intended to be interpreted. There are no scars to obscure my view (the Lord Jesus bore them all) and I don&rsquo;t see life through the threat of suffering. I am willing, and able, to draw you near, to see you clearly and focus on you entirely without distortion or tension</p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem, as you&rsquo;ve already guessed, is that, both lids being up, I tend to use both eyes. You too? I think most of us do. And I think that&rsquo;s the way God intended it. If we believe in His sovereignty, then we have to believe that we have perfect vision in both eyes. Surprised? Yeah, me too, even now as I talk to myself about this. But think about it with me. Who sees the world exactly like I do? No one (and you may thank God in your prayers later!). But my vision is not entirely unique either. Other people have had generally the same experiences, the same influences, the same information-input, and those things shaped their lives similarly to mine. Though not exactly the same, we still see the world through warped lenses. The only difference may be that I have one good eye (thanks to Jesus) that gives me perspective on what is a clear and true and right view of the world, and I can offer that to someone who can only see the rain on the windshield and not beyond it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo back to the doctor&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;Which eye do you use the most?&rdquo; Honestly, I would have to confess that it depends on the day and its events. Honestly, sometimes it&rsquo;s a real strain to focus through my one good eye, even with my glasses on. Honestly, some days it&rsquo;s easier to go around completely unfocused. And honestly, I think a healthy balance between the two is what makes me most effective for the kingdom. 20/20 is over rated.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;<em>Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</em>&nbsp;Corinthians 13:12.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

For those who have no faith, no explanation is possible.&rdquo; </em>This quote has been borrowed and maligned by many an author but it is most often credited in this particular phrasing to John Stuart Mill, although St. Thomas Aquinas gets the nod for having the thought originally. Read it again.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;Those who have faith need no explanation. For those who have no faith, no explanation is possible.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWhen my small group talked about the nature of faith a few months ago we likened faith in God to the same faith we have when sitting in a chair. When I sit in a chair I am showing faith that it will hold me. I have come to that conclusion through the experience of trying the chair. It has never failed me. It was designed for the purpose of supporting a sitter, sometimes under great stress. When you consider this quote in light of that application, you could say that I have faith that the chair will hold me and I don&rsquo;t really care why. I don&rsquo;t need the structural blueprints, the physics lesson about weight and distribution, or a signed certificate ensuring that the chair is sound. I know what a chair is for and I&rsquo;m going to use it in the way it was intended to be used.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider the flip side. Look at that chair. Now look at&hellip;you. Seriously, are those four spindly legs going to keep you from crashing to the ground? What are the odds that they won&rsquo;t? What is the consequence if they don&rsquo;t? Will the physics lesson help you here? Will the structural blueprints be reassuring? Will a signed certificate from the manufacturer reduce your risk?</p>\n<p>\n\tHappily, on most days I land in the &ldquo;no explanation required&rdquo; camp with my faith in God just like with my faith in chairs. I know my limits, and I know my load. I also know that God is the only chair big enough to hold me and my load, and I&rsquo;m tired. I want to sit down. I don&rsquo;t care why He works; I only know that He does&hellip;no explanation required.</p>\n<p>\n\tReady to take a load off? Need me to explain it to you?<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t<br />\n\tHave you ever met someone who had an immediate and positive impact on your outlook for life? In my life such meetings have been rare but they have happened. I was recently blessed when I met a friend of a friend while out at lunch. Our introduction began in a normal fashion:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 36pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">\n\t&ldquo;Kevin, meet my friend, Brady.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 36pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">\n\t&ldquo;Kevin? Hi! Nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 36pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">\n\t&ldquo;Nice to meet you, too!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tWe exchanged the normal pleasantries, asking each other how long we had known Chad, our mutual friend: are you married, have any kids, etc. Then the conversation turned to work.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 36pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">\n\t&ldquo;So, Kevin, what do you do?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 36pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;\">\n\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the import business.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tChad turned to him with a shocked look on his face. &ldquo;Did you lose your job at the bank? You&rsquo;ve been there for years! What happened?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin smiled at him. &ldquo;Yes, I still work at the bank but Brady didn&rsquo;t ask what my <strong>job </strong>was. He asked what I <strong>do</strong>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tHe turned to me to explain, &ldquo;Although I work at a bank as a job to provide for my family, what I have been charged to <strong>do </strong>by my Creator is be an importer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin must have notice the puzzled look on my face because he went on.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&ldquo;For the past few hundred years Christianity has made <strong>finding salvation </strong>the goal of their evangelistic work: once a person is saved then their work is done.\" He wiped his hands together as if finishing a task. \"The Bible, however, describes salvation as merely the <em>introduction </em>to much greater work: the import business. Believers are supposed to import G-d&rsquo;s holiness and righteousness into this world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;In the heavenly realm of G-d&rsquo;s kingdom everything that is said and done is imbued with G-d&rsquo;s perfect holiness and righteousness. Because of the fallen state of our earthly realm, G-d has withdrawn Himself from it&hellip; to some degree. It says in James 2:5 that &lsquo;G-d has chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and<em> heirs to the kingdom </em>which He promised to those who love Him.&rsquo; James was talking about you and me! We are heirs to the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Although we live in the kingdom of this world (for now) we are citizens of G-d&rsquo;s kingdom. It&#39;s like we&#39;re traveling abroad on business and our job is to import holiness and righteousness from our true kingdom, G-d&rsquo;s kingdom, into this world. As Christ said in Matthew 5:16, &lsquo;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may <strong>see your good works</strong>, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.&rsquo; Although Christ&rsquo;s kingdom has not yet been fully established on the earth (that won&rsquo;t fully happen until He returns) we are members of His kingdom <strong>now </strong>and, with the help and guidance of the Holy Spirit, we can live our lives in a way that reflects that truth.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin grinned and said, &ldquo;OK&hellip; <em>technically </em>speaking we have two jobs. We need to be importers and we need to teach others to be importers as well.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tWe continued our conversation for a while and then parted ways. I left our meeting blessed and encouraged&hellip; and with a new understanding of who I am in G-d&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tHello! Nice to meet you. My name is Brady and I&rsquo;m in the import business.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tMy son&rsquo;s Language class has been working on essays to submit to <em>This I Believe</em>, &ldquo;an international organization engaging people in writing and sharing essays describing the core values that guide their daily lives&rdquo;. This I Believe began as a radio series in the 1950s hosted by Edward R. Murrow and has since grown into a cultural phenomenon of sorts. Their website has over 90,000 essays written by people from every corner of the universe, including one by Helen Keller that will seize the breath in your chest and squeeze your heart in its fist.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile my son&rsquo;s class was working on their less soul-wrenching essays, I was piqued by the proclamation, <em>This I Believe</em>&hellip;, and I wanted to answer it. I wanted to nail it down. There are lots of things that we all say we believe, but to put one fine point to it and eliminate all others means to drill down through layers of fluff to get to the still small voice that moves and motivates every action of our lives. <em>This</em> I Believe. The truth is, what we truly believe can be ugly. It can be a lie that speaks through and misdirects our lives. For those reasons I found that I can write an essay that says, <em>This I Believe</em>, and still not believe it in a way that effectively impacts my life. In truth, the essay ought to be written from the outsider&rsquo;s perspective mirroring what they see our lives say we believe. So, from this understanding I endeavored to write the essay below, which I think is a more honest expression of what I would like for you to know that I believe because of the way I live. Here goes&hellip;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>This I (want to) Believe</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tI believe that I could not love my son any more, nor any less, than I do at this very moment. My love for him is an unwavering constant. Oh, there have been moments when I have not liked him much, but like is a fickle feeling of emotional response. There have been moments when he has crushed me with disappointment, but it has not diminished my love for him. It is the hopeful anticipation of something better than what he delivered that tells me that love is ever there. There have been moments when he has hurt me deeply, but what wound inflicted by one we adore does not bleed profusely? There have certainly been moments of joy and gratification because of a turn of events wrought by his hand but these, neither, have affected my love by inflation. Nor have the moments of tender affection. Though my heart-fire is fanned by his warmth, it is none-the-less, an eternal flame.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have long expressed my love to my son by describing it as being &ldquo;as big as the blue sky&rdquo;. It is an eternal expanse, immeasurable by human calculation. Of course, he thinks it&rsquo;s just big. But it is more than big. It is uncontainable, it is without boundary, its ways can not be counted. A thing without number can not be reduced, nor can it increase. East and West can not be separated where they meet. I believe that my love for my son is like this.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause I believe this, I therefore must believe that God loves me likewise. Even I, a mortal, fallible, unloving, unlovable finite being can love in a way that is unshakable, unconditional. How much more so the Heavenly Father? It is inconceivable that His love could be more constant than mine. And yet. And yet I must concede that the author of my love, having written the recipe, knows the ingredients best. His love is an unchangeable, everlasting, never-ending love as big as the blue sky which His hand stretched across the heavens. It is a fixed constant. Oh yes! I have disappointed Him. I will continue to do so until He claims me for eternity. Yes, I have hurt Him beyond measure and at the expense of His son, but His love did not diminish for having paid the price. I have the occasional moment of endearment which pleases Him, but He does not love more so in these moments than in the moments when I am in completely un-tethered oblivion. He loves in this way. It is unalterable. It is unvarying. It is sure. I am often forgetful of this truth, but this I believe.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI&#39;m often asked by beginning Bible students which book of the Bible should they study first? Most Christians assume they should start in a Gospel, like <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_book_of_luke/\">Luke</a></strong>, or in an epistle like <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_book_of_romans/\">Romans</a></strong>, or perhaps in <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/genesis_2011/\">Genesis</a></strong>, since it is the beginning of all things. All these books are excellent choices, (and for that matter, any book of the Bible can be a good place to start so long as we keep studying!), but I usually suggest taking a different approach. I recommend new Bible studients begin by taking our <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/\">Revelation</a></strong> course.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/\"><img alt=\"Revelation - Most Important Book in the Bible\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/newrevelation.jpg\" style=\"margin: 15px 10px; float: right; width: 300px; height: 294px;\" /></a>If the 66 books of the Bible may be compared to a novel having 66 chapters, then Revelation is the final chapter in God&#39;s novel. Just as a novel must be read cover to cover if it is to be understood properly, so must Bible students have an understanding of the Bible&#39;s first 65 books if we are to truly understand its culminating \"chapter\" of Revelation.</p>\n<p>\n\tI recommend studyng the VBVM Revelation study because it covers not only the 22 chapters of John&#39;s vision but also relevant sections of Daniel, Deuteronomy, Leviticus, <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_book_of_ruth/\">Ruth</a></strong>, the Psalms, the minor prophets, <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/isaiah/\">Isaiah</a></strong>, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, the Gospels and the Epistles. Virtually every book of the Bible is referenced during the course of this 10-month class, leading many VBVM students to joke that our Revelation course is actually an attempt to teach the entire Bible in a single class. We plead guilty!</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat better way for a new Bible student to begin their study of Scripture than in a class that presents the entire arc of Scripture setting everything in its proper perspective? Admittedly, this is a lofty goal, and it&#39;s why I recommend our Revelation class to new students.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext week, Verse By Verse Ministry launches the first major revision of our Revelation course in six years. Our previous course served us well since 2005, but we retired that course this month and removed all lessons from the website in preparation for the new material. Our new Revelation course has been completely reorganized and rewritten from the ground up, and it now includes hundreds of new charts and visual aids. For the first time, we will also offer both audio AND written lessons notes, and the visual aids have been numbered and associated to specific lessons to help you follow along.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe&#39;re excited to offer this revised course, and we hope you will join us online or in person. You can find more information about the Revelation course by visiting our <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/events/revelation_2011/\">Revelation class page</a></strong>, and you will be able to download the new lessons starting September 9th. Please share this information with your friends and family, and may the Lord be glorified in our teaching of His word.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t(Also, if you live near the Austin, Texas, area, feel free to join us in our other on-going study in <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/events/genesis_2011/\">Genesis</a>. </strong>&nbsp;And be sure to check out our latest answers to listener questions in our <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/\">Question &amp; Answers</a></strong> section.

                 "body": "<p>\n\tGeorge Barna has a new book out and a friend of mine put it in my hands a week ago with the plea, &ldquo;Read this! I need someone to talk to about it.&rdquo; My friend and I have different reading tastes but we are both extremely greedy with our time and give it selfishly only to good material so I knew she wouldn&rsquo;t ask if it weren&rsquo;t important. The title, &ldquo;Maximum Faith &ndash; Live like Jesus&rdquo;, leaves me cold because it does not begin to do justice to the content (although the number of typographical errors and lack of editing is absolutely appalling!!!). But I&rsquo;m not here to give a book review. I&rsquo;m here to talk about peaches.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeaches are in season right now. It&rsquo;s a time on planet earth that must be akin to heaven, and parallels only the heavenly blueberry season. I like peaches with the sweet, fuzzy skin still wrapped around the supple flesh so I don&rsquo;t lose one drop of mouth-watering syrup in the peeling process. The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about a peach is the pit. Most of the peaches we eat are of the Clingstone variety, and they do just what their name implies: they cling to the stone &ndash; a stubborn and maddening dilemma for an impatient peach lover.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, there I was reading Barna&rsquo;s book, thinking how incredibly it parallel&rsquo;s my place on the journey right now, and slicing a peach to go with my lunch. The precious juice was running down the sides of my hands and sliding onto my wrists as I wrestled with that darn pit, all the while trying not to squish the just-exactly-perfectly-ripe flesh. I realized that the trick is to hold the flesh side very gently, though firmly, with one hand, while digging in and violently wrenching that stubborn pit out with the other hand. It makes your mind do weird things to have your hands simultaneously performing such opposing maneuvers.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I licked my arms to the elbows and threw the pit into the trash-can I had one of those moments of crystal clarity that God sometimes allows. As I dripped on the floor I realized that this pit-wrenching process is what Barna is talking about!! And it&rsquo;s about to become my life.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf Jesus ever ate a peach during His time on earth, we don&rsquo;t know about it. I have to believe, though, that if He had, He surely would have used it in a parable. Remember the scripture where God says, &ldquo;<em>I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws</em>.&rdquo; (Ezekiel 36:26-27)? See it already? My flesh is wrapped around a heart of stone and clings to it with all the fiber of my being, just like that sweet, ripe peach.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe question Barna poses goes beyond our salvation. We have the Spirit within us, but so what. What have we allowed Him to do with us since then? What Barna asks us is whether or not we will allow the Lord to do the pit-wrenching. We can say no. We can decide that we&rsquo;re happy dressing up the bowl and we can rest there in comfort, looking scrumptious, releasing a perfume that rises with the currents of the a/c, but missing our intended purpose, and withering, shriveling, wrinkling until we are a slimy mess of goo on the counter, or a petrified surprise in the crisper drawer. Or we can surrender our will. (Imagine our surprise if the peach resisted!) We can give ourselves up to His purpose and let Him hold us with tenderness in one hand, while He rips out that heart of stone with the other. It&rsquo;s delicate, brutal surgery. It is necessary if we are going to be consumed by our creator.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou&rsquo;ll have to read Barna&rsquo;s book yourself to see what he has to say. For now, think about the peach. How pretty it is. How utterly useless until it is pitted. The gentle violence necessary to see it fully realize its purpose for existing. How gloriously delicious it is when it has been sliced and gutted and the juice is running down your chin and you&rsquo;re slurping every drop of its resplendent flavor. Delight doesn&rsquo;t begin to describe a peach consumed &ndash; or a saint surrendered.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

I noticed that I didn&rsquo;t have any &ndash; not physically speaking of course, but spiritually, emotionally, mentally. I was completely expelled. I had breathed out all I had and I was done. I had a tiny little melt down when I noticed that I did not have the breath necessary to take one more step, to face one more train, to look the rest of the day in the eye from the standing side of my bed. In that moment all I had left was breath to whisper a strangled, &ldquo;I need your help, Lord&rdquo;&hellip;and then I could breathe again.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;ve always been so awed by the part in the creation story where God breathed into Adam - and he lived. I mean, how cool is that? God gave Adam His very breath and all the days of Adam&rsquo;s life were sustained by that one life-giving breath. God breathed out. Adam breathed in. Adam breathed out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Now I know what that feels like.</p>\n<p>\n\tCan you breathe? Are you strangled for air, left gasping, panting, winded?

Do you remember it? Circa 1970s red feetie-jammie leotard with a big gold lightening bolt on the front and a cape that hung straight down when he was \"flying\". At the end of every show was a gentle admonition by Captain Marvel followed by the requisite heart-felt repentance: \"Gee, Tommy, I can see now how wrong I was to say those mean things to you. Can you ever forgive me?\" Captain Marvel&nbsp;would always&nbsp;give the predictable \"go and sin no more\" response and everyone would walk hand in hand out of frame. <strong><em>Shazam!</em></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tI can remember at the end of that show, and others from the era, feeling a sense of completeness and resolution. I think those shows, and some of the recent superhero movies, give me the hope that it really can be OK in the end. Maybe it&rsquo;s that romantic optimism which keeps pushing me to find the repentant moment, the orderly wrap up and the walk into the sunset. There&rsquo;s a certain kind of na&iuml;vet&eacute; that&rsquo;s required for that and it has become what those 1940&rsquo;s comics and 1970s dramas did &ndash; obsolete.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile I have grown wise enough in the ways of the world to see these change-of-heart conclusions as unrealistic and scoff-worthy, there is still a bit of me that has the child-like faith to believe that it can occasionally be that simple. As Christians, we go out into the world with this optimistic outlook eager to find one repentant sinner who will say, \"Gee Lord, I can see now how wrong I was. Please forgive me and save me.\" But usually things are not that tidy. The wrap up is usually way more complicated and takes more time than Captain Marvel has to stop the car from teetering off the cliff. I&rsquo;m not sure I would believe it 100% anyway, if it happened that easily, unless just for my sake God hollered,<strong><em>&ldquo;SHAZAM!&rdquo;</em></strong> and then I&rsquo;d know for sure.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tWe often receive questions from readers asking for help answering <strong>Jewish objections to Jesus</strong> as the Messiah.&nbsp; We have compiled answers to those questions below.&nbsp; Many of the questions we receive stem from an Aish.com article entitled <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jw/s/48892792.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why Jews Don&#39;t Believe in Jesus</a>.&nbsp; The majority of our answers address Jewish objections from that article point by point.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore we begin, we find it important to make two observations:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>1) The mental exercise of answering objections will not cause a person&#39;s heart to change.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn the story of Lazarus and the rich man, Abraham declares, \"If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.\" (Luke 16:31)</p>\n<p>\n\tThe primary reason Jews reject Jesus as the Messiah is because (as a whole) G-d has blinded their eyes (Romans 11:7-8) and hardened their hearts for a season to allow the fullness of the gentiles to come into G-d&#39;s kingdom. (Romans 11:25)&nbsp; This is part of G-d&#39;s sovereign plan of salvation and until G-d&#39;s timing is complete that national blindness and hardness will not change.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2) Salvation is G-d&#39;s work... not ours.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBelievers are <strong>never </strong>given the responsibility of making converts or \"getting people saved\".&nbsp; Our job is to testify as witnesses to the work G-d has performed in each of our lives (Acts 1:8) and to make disciples (Matthew 28:19-20) among those G-d has saved by His choice (John 15:16) and His power (Acts 2:47).&nbsp; Please do not think you have any responsibility to \"save the Jews\".&nbsp; G-d saved them once during the Exodus from Egypt (Exodus 14:30) and He is entirely able to save them again when the time is right.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tNow to the questions and answers...</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Claim: <strong>Jesus Did Not Fulfill the Messianic Prophecies</strong></h2>\n<p>\n\tThe Bible says that the Messiah will:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tBuild the Third Temple (Ezekiel 37:26-28).</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tGather all Jews back to the Land of Israel (Isaiah 43:5-6).</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tUsher in an era of world peace, and end all hatred, oppression, suffering, and disease. As it says: \"Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall man learn war anymore.\" (Isaiah 2:4)</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSpread universal knowledge of the God of Israel, which will unite humanity as one. As it says: \"God will be King over all the world &#8213; on that day, God will be One and His Name will be One\" (Zechariah 14:9).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tChristians counter that Jesus will fulfill these in the Second Coming, but Jewish sources show that the Messiah will fulfill the prophecies outright; in the Bible no concept of a second coming exists.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Response</h2>\n<p>\n\tThe Hebrew word for Messiah (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1495;, mashiach) is extremely rare in the writings of the Prophets.&nbsp; This word is only found once in Isaiah, once in Lamentations, twice in Daniel, and once in Habakkuk.</p>\n<p>\n\tNone of the verses noted above state that either \"a messiah\" or \"the Messiah\" would do <u><strong>any</strong></u> of these things.&nbsp; Every one of these prophecies says that <strong>G-d </strong>will accomplish them:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t\"I will... set My sanctuary in their midst forever.\" says the <strong>LORD G-d</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t\"I will bring your offspring from the east, and gather you from the west.\" says the <strong>LORD G-d</strong>.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tAnd He [the <strong>LORD G-d</strong>] will judge between the nations, and will render decisions for many peoples...and never again will they learn war.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tAnd the <strong>LORD G-d </strong>will be king over all the earth; in that day, He will be the only one, and His name the only one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tBelievers recognize these prophecies as \"Messianic\" because we acknowledge that Jesus the Messiah is G-d made flesh (John 1:14, Colossians 2:9) and we look forward to Him fulfilling these prophecies.&nbsp; Jews cannot claim these are \"Messianic\" prophecies unless they accept G-d in the flesh... which they do not.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\tThe Prophecies</h3>\n<p>\n\tWhen we consider the specific prophecies that are mentioned we find that they only occur <strong>after </strong>G-d makes a covenant of peace with Israel.&nbsp; Israel cannot be at peace with G-d until the sin that separates them from Him has been addressed.&nbsp; Jesus (<em>Yeshua </em>in Hebrew) is the only means of reconciliation between G-d and Israel through His work and the shedding of His sinless blood.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce G-d brings Israel to national salvation then He will:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tGather the Jews back to their Land</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tEstablish His sanctuary in their midst</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tUsher in an era of world peace</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSpread the universal knowledge of Himself</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWe await G-d&#39;s perfect timing for this event.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Second Coming</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWhile it is true that the exact phrase \"second coming\" is not found in either the Jewish <em><strong>or </strong></em>Christian Bible, it is disingenuous to claim that no concept of the second coming exists in Scripture.&nbsp; If we believe there is only one \"capital-M\" Messiah then it is reasonable to think He would come twice because there are two distinct pictures of Him given in Scripture: the servant and the sovereign.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Judaism the <strong>servant </strong>Messiah is called <em>Mashiach ben Yosef </em>(Messiah son of Joseph) in reference to the servant pictured by Joseph at the end of the book of Genesis.&nbsp; The book of Daniel refers to Messiah being \"cut off\" and Joseph was cut off from his family.&nbsp; There are numerous parallels between Joseph and Messiah and Judaism recognizes this.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe <strong>sovereign </strong>Messiah is called<em><strong> Mashiach ben David </strong></em>(Messiah son of David) in reference to the reigning sovereign pictured by King David.&nbsp; Numerous passages refer to the authority and kingdom of David... and yet David did not receive the fullness of those promises.&nbsp; Those promises find their fulfillment in the coming Messiah and Judaism recognizes this as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tScripture itself provides a picture of this \"return of the King\":</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I will go away and return to My place Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me. </em>(Hosea 5:15)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce Israel acknowledges their guilt and seek His face then Messiah will return.&nbsp; That time will come:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.&nbsp; </em>(Zechariah 12:10)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tJudaism itself recognizes \"second comings\".&nbsp; Every year at Passover, Jews all over the world look for the second coming of Elijah the prophet.&nbsp; At a specific point in the Seder meal, a child opens the door of the home and recites some words asking if Elijah has returned and inviting him into the home.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Claim: <strong>Jesus Did Not Embody the Personal Qualifications of Messiah</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Messiah as Prophet</strong><br />\n\t\tJesus was not a prophet; he appeared on the scene approximately 350 years after prophecy had ended.<br />\n\t\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Descendent of David</strong><br />\n\t\tJesus could not have possibly fulfilled the messianic requirement of being descended on his father&#39;s side from King David.<br />\n\t\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Torah Observance</strong><br />\n\t\tJesus contradicts the Torah (the Law of Moses) and states that its commandments are no longer applicable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Response&nbsp;<span id=\"cke_bm_391S\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><span id=\"cke_bm_392S\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><span id=\"cke_bm_393S\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><span id=\"cke_bm_394S\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;<span>&#65279;</span><span>&#65279;</span></span></h2>\n<h3>\n\t<span id=\"cke_bm_392E\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><span id=\"cke_bm_391E\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span>Messiah as Prophet</h3>\n<p>\n\tIn the mid to late second century, Judaism established an arbitrary \"end of prophecy\" upon the death of the prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi and declared that <em>Yeshua </em>cannot be the Messiah since \"he appeared on the scene approximately 350 years after prophecy had ended.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tIf this were true then according to Judaism Messiah can <strong>never </strong>come.&nbsp; Any Messiah that showed up today, tomorrow, next week, or next year would \"appear on the scene <strong>2,350 </strong>years after prophecy had ended\" and would not qualify as a prophet either.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn contrast, believers know that God continues to appoint apostles, <strong>prophets</strong>, teachers, miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, and various kinds of tongues. (1 Corinthians 12:28)</p>\n<p>\n\tThere has not been an end to prophecy.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\t<span id=\"cke_bm_403S\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><span id=\"cke_bm_404S\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span>Descendant of David<span id=\"cke_bm_404E\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><span id=\"cke_bm_403E\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p>\n\tJudaism has invented a requirement of patriarchal lineage (i.e. lineage through the father) that does not exist in Scripture.&nbsp; The Law of Moses allows for inheritance and continuation of lineage through daughters as well as sons. (see Numbers 27:1-7)</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a rather ironic twist, modern Judaism only acknowledges Jewish heritage and legitimacy through a <strong>mother&#39;s</strong> lineage... not the father&#39;s.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\tTorah Observance</h3>\n<p>\n\tQuoting Aish.com:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The Messiah will lead the Jewish people to full Torah observance. The Torah states that all mitzvot [commandments] remain binding forever, and anyone coming to change the Torah is immediately identified as a false prophet. (Deut. 13:1-4)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Throughout the New Testament, Jesus contradicts the Torah and states that its commandments are no longer applicable. For example, John 9:14 records that Jesus made a paste in violation of Shabbat, which caused the Pharisees to say (verse 16), \"He does not observe Shabbat!\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile it is entirely true that most Christians today ignore G-d&#39;s holy days, dietary laws, and other commandments with varying degrees of temerity and distain, <strong>Christ Himself did not</strong>.&nbsp; In my opinion, these actions and attitudes of Christians are the single largest stumbling block in the path of Jews who might become believers.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough various anti-missionary groups argue that \"Jesus annulled the commandments which makes him a false prophet\", Scripture itself does not support their claim.&nbsp; In fact, it tells us the exact opposite:</p>\n<p>\n\t1) Messiah Himself commanded His followers, \"Do <strong>not </strong>think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.\"(Matthew 5:17) &nbsp;He declared that until heaven and earth pass away not even the least letter shall pass from the Law.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last time I checked, the heaven and earth are still present!</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t2) In the first century, Messiah&#39;s enemies wanted to put Him to death.&nbsp; They hungered for it as a starving man craves food.&nbsp; Yet they <strong>never </strong>charge Him with violating the Law or being a false prophet.&nbsp; Conviction on such a charge would have easily warranted the death penalty.&nbsp; Instead Scripture tells us that His enemies kept trying to obtain <strong>false </strong>testimony against Him (Matthew 26:59-60, Mark 14:55-59) but they did not succeed.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\tSomething Greater Than the Temple</h3>\n<p>\n\tHealing, making paste, picking grain... all of these are considered violations of the Sabbath according to Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>\n\tMessiah healed on the Sabbath, made paste, and allowed His disciples to pick grain.&nbsp; There are only three possible options to describe what He was doing:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>1) He was violating or abolishing the Sabbath.</strong><br />\n\tIf this were true then the Law requires His death for violating the Sabbath.&nbsp; His enemies never charged Him with this crime so neither should we.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2) He was abolishing the man-made rules about the Sabbath.</strong><br />\n\tThis, too, would have been a sin against the Law and neither His enemies nor Scripture itself accuse Him of this.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3) He was establishing a hierarchy of the commandments.</strong><br />\n\tIn defending His actions, the Master points to examples from Scripture:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, he and his companions, how he entered the house of God, and they ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him, but for the priests alone? Or have you not read in the Law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and are innocent?&nbsp; But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.&nbsp; But if you had known what this means, &#39;I DESIRE COMPASSION, AND NOT A SACRIFICE,&#39; you would not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\" </em>(Matthew 12:3-8)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn defending Himself, Messiah points to King David&#39;s clear violation of the Law in eating the consecrated bread and the priests&#39; clear violation of the Law in working on the Sabbath... and yet they are innocent.&nbsp; How is this true?</p>\n<p>\n\tIn declaring \"something greater than the Temple is here\", He was not referring to Himself.&nbsp; The Pharisees would have never accepted such an argument!&nbsp; The thing \"greater than the Temple\" was the need of those who were sick and the hunger of His disciples.&nbsp; In these examples, Messiah illustrates that showing compassion for simple human hunger (in the case of David) and need (in the case of the priests&#39; serving the needs of others) is the portion of the Law that must be observed <strong>before </strong>the stringencies of the Sabbath.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf anti-missionary Jews today only knew what this means, \"I desire compassion, and not sacrifice\", they would not condemn the Innocent One.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Claim: <strong>Verses \"Referring\" to Jesus Are Mistranslated</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Virgin Birth</strong><br />\n\t\tIsaiah 7:14 says that a \"young woman\" will give birth not a \"virgin\".<br />\n\t\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Suffering Servant</strong><br />\n\t\tThe suffering servant in Isaiah 53 refers to Israel... not Jesus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Response</h2>\n<h3>\n\tVirgin Birth</h3>\n<p>\n\t<em>Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel. </em>(Isaiah 7:14)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Isaiah 7:11, G-d tells King Ahaz, \"Ask for a sign for yourself from the LORD your G-d; make it as deep as Sheol or high as heaven.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tAhaz declines in fear saying, \"I will not ask, nor will I test the LORD!\" (verse 12)</p>\n<p>\n\tIn verse 14, G-d declares His choice of a miraculous sign for Ahaz: a virgin shall be with child and bear a son.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the anti-missionaries the miraculous sign G-d chose was that a \"young woman\" would get pregnant (presumably in the normal way) and have a son.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; How is something that happens millions of times every year a miracle?</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, the Hebrew of this passage uses the word \"<em>alma</em>\".&nbsp; Yes, that word generally means \"a young woman\", however, young women described using this word are <strong>virgins</strong>.&nbsp; A young woman who is <strong>not </strong>a virgin is called a <em>naarah</em>.&nbsp; Jacob&#39;s daughter Dinah (who is raped by a young man) is described using <em>naarah </em>and not <em>alma</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tBetween 130 to 350 years before Messiah was born, Jewish scholars translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek... a translation we call The Septuagint.&nbsp; They translated the Hebrew word alma in Isaiah 7:14 into the Greek word <em>parthenos</em>.&nbsp; This word <em>parthenos </em>means \"a young woman who is a virgin\".</p>\n<p>\n\tCenturies of debate among Jewish scholars record that some considered the child of Isaiah 7:14 to be <strong>the </strong>Messiah and others to be <strong>a </strong>messiah (an \"annointed one\", specifically Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz).&nbsp; The point of this is that Jews definitely consider this to be a Messianic passage of Scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\tSuffering Servant</h3>\n<p>\n\tQuoting Aish.com:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>In actuality, Isaiah 53 directly follows the theme of chapter 52, describing the exile and redemption of the Jewish people. The prophecies are written in the singular form because the Jews (\"Israel\") are regarded as one unit. Throughout Jewish scripture, Israel is repeatedly called, in the singular, the \"Servant of God\" (see Isaiah 43:8). In fact, Isaiah states no less than 11 times in the chapters prior to 53 that the Servant of God is Israel. When read correctly, Isaiah 53 clearly [and ironically] refers to the Jewish people being \"bruised, crushed and as sheep brought to slaughter\" at the hands of the nations of the world. These descriptions are used throughout Jewish scripture to graphically describe the suffering of the Jewish people (see Psalm 44). Isaiah 53 concludes that when the Jewish people are redeemed, the nations will recognize and accept responsibility for the inordinate suffering and death of the Jews.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a common anti-missionary claim.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, there are several holes in their logic:</p>\n<p>\n\t1) The suffering servant of Isaiah 53 is innocent and guiltless and \"had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth\".&nbsp; In contrast, Isaiah describes Israel as a \"sinful nation, a people weighed down with iniquity.\" (Isaiah 1:4)</p>\n<p>\n\t2) The suffering servant of Isaiah 53:3 was not esteemed by Israel (\"we did not esteem Him\") and yet Israel esteems themselves daily in their prayers:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"Praiseworthy are those who dwell in Your house; may they always praise You, Selah!&nbsp; Praiseworthy is the people for whom this is so, praiseworthy is the people whose G-d is the LORD!\" </em>[The Artscroll Siddur]</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t3) The suffering servant of Isaiah 53:8 suffers the penalty of the transgression in lieu of \"my people,\" [Israel] \"to whom the stroke was due\".&nbsp; This cannot be Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\t4) The suffering servant dies, is buried, and is called rich in His death (verse 9) and yet the nation of Israel has never died or been buried.</p>\n<p>\n\t5) The suffering servant of Isaiah 53 serves as a \"guilt-offering\" (Hebrew: asham).&nbsp; This type of offering is used to atone for willful sin.&nbsp; Can the suffering of a sinful nation serve to atone for their own sins much less the sins of other nations?&nbsp; No!</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe suffering servant of Isaiah 53 is not Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\t<span id=\"cke_bm_457S\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span>The Claim: <strong>Jewish Belief is Based Solely on National Revelation</strong><span id=\"cke_bm_458E\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><span id=\"cke_bm_457E\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p>\n\tAgain quoting Aish.com:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Judaism, unique among all of the world&#39;s major religions, does not rely on \"claims of miracles\" as the basis for its religion. In fact, the Bible says that God sometimes grants the power of \"miracles\" to charlatans, in order to test Jewish loyalty to the Torah (Deut. 13:4).<br />\n\t&nbsp;<br />\n\tOf the thousands of religions in human history, only Judaism bases its belief on national revelation &#8213; i.e. God speaking to the entire nation. If God is going to start a religion, it makes sense He&#39;ll tell everyone, not just one person.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Response</h2>\n<p>\n\tDuring the national revelation of G-d to Israel at Mt. Sinai this event occurred:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then Moses went up with Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, <strong>and they saw the God of Israel</strong>; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, as clear as the sky itself.&nbsp; Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel; <strong>and they saw God</strong>, and they ate and drank.</em>&nbsp; (Exodus 24:9-11)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tMoses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up on the mountain and they saw the G-d of Israel!</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd He had feet.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe prophet Zechariah speaks of another national revelation that is coming to Israel:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations [who seek to destroy Israel], as when He fights on a day of battle.&nbsp; In that day <strong>His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives</strong>, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.&nbsp; </em>(Zechariah 14:3-4)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Mount of Olives will be split in two when the G-d of Israel arrives to protect His people.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd He has feet.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe national revelation at Sinai was conducted through a mediator: Moses.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe national revelation of the Messiah during His first coming was conducted directly by Himself but His people rejected Him (John 1:11)... all&nbsp;as part of G-d&#39;s plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe national revelation of the Messiah during His second coming will be conducted by Himself, a great trumpet, myriads of legions of angels, and mountains splitting in half.&nbsp; Every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him (Revelation 1:7) and every knee will bow and every tongue will confess (Isaiah 45:23) the Name that is above all names (Philippians 2:9).</p>\n<p>\n\tOh, Lord, hasten the coming of that day!</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\t<span id=\"cke_bm_471S\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><span id=\"cke_bm_472S\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;AdditionalAddads;fkljasdfpoiuqwer;lkjasdf</span>Additional Notes-</h2>\n<h2>\n\tAdoption<span id=\"cke_bm_472E\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><span id=\"cke_bm_471E\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p>\n\tThis appeared in the \"footnotes\" section of the Aish.com web page that inspired this article:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>There is no Biblical basis for the idea of a father passing on his tribal line by adoption. A priest who adopts a son from another tribe cannot make him a priest by adoption;</em></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not true.&nbsp; Scripture actually provides an example of this:</p>\n<p>\n\tEli the priest adopts Samuel the Ephraimite (1 Samuel 1).&nbsp; Later, Samuel ministers to G-d (1 Sam 3:1) and then hears from the LORD while sleeping in \"the temple of the LORD when the ark of G-d was\". (1 Samuel 3:3)</p>\n<p>\n\tClearly, Samuel the Ephraimite was serving and living in places reserved only for the Levites.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Cursed King</h2>\n<p>\n\tThis appeared in the \"footnotes\" section of the Aish.com web page that instigated this article:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Joseph could never pass on by adoption that which he doesn&#39;t have. Because Joseph descended from Jeconiah (Matthew 1:11) he fell under the curse of that king that none of his descendants could ever sit as king upon the throne of David.</em> (Jeremiah 22:30; 36:30)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tJeconiah (also called Coniah and Jehoiachin) was the next to the last king of Judah who reigned before Zedekiah.&nbsp; He reigned for three months and did evil in the sight of the LORD.&nbsp; In Jeremiah 22:24-30 the LORD pronounces a curse on Jeconiah and his descendants, declaring them ineligible to sit upon the throne of David as the king of Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome Christian scholars have pointed to this curse as originating the necessity of virgin birth.&nbsp; King David&#39;s lineage through Jeconiah is completely cut off from the Davidic promises.&nbsp; If Joseph was the father of Jesus then the G-d&#39;s curse on Jeconiah would have been passed along to Him and He would not have been qualified to be King.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe curse declares that Jeconiah would never prosper however, Jeremiah records this:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison. Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon. So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king&#39;s presence regularly all the days of his life. For his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king of Babylon, a daily portion all the days of his life until the day of his death. </em>(Jeremiah 52:31-34)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tNote that the curse declares \"no man of his descendants will prosper sitting on the throne of David or ruling again in Judah.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; Within two generations, however, a descendant of Jehoiachin is ruling over Judah:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then the word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying, \"Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah, saying, &#39;I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.

On that day,&#39; declares the LORD of hosts, &#39;I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant,&#39; declares the LORD, &#39;and I will make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you,&#39;\" declares the LORD of hosts. </em>(Haggai 2:20-23)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tZerubbabel is the grandson of Jeconiah (1 Chronicles 3:17-19, Matthew 1:12) and yet he is ruling over Judah.&nbsp; Although Jeremiah declared that Jeconiah was the signet ring G-d would remove (Jeremiah 22:24) his grandson, Zerubbabel is described as the signet ring G-d would put on (Haggai 2:23)!</p>\n<p>\n\tBased upon these passages of Scripture even the Talmudic Sages of Judaism unanimously agreed that Jeconiah was forgiven for his transgressions by the end of his life.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tWe just returned from a family vacation to Las Vegas. Don&rsquo;t judge. My husband had a convention there so it was a pretty sweet deal for my son and me to tag along. I spent the week marveling at many things but primarily at the fa&ccedil;ades. Every building is a testimony to something it isn&#39;t: the pyraminds and Sphinx, New York City, Paris, Venice, Rome, the circus, volcanoes and pirate ships, flamingo gardens and lion habitats, chapels and coliseums.&nbsp; I had to explain to my son that the word facade means &ldquo;fake front&rdquo;. He wanted to know what was behind them. Good question.</p>\n<p>\n\tSwitch gears with me for a second. I have a friend here at home who is one of the most faithful followers of Christ that I know. She and her husband raised their son in the church; one of those families who are there every time the doors are open. Her son came up (as we like to say) in the youth group at our church and was active to the point of committing to ministry as an adult and following that path in school. But that didn&rsquo;t work out the way he expected it to. He married a girl who is hard after God. But that didn&rsquo;t work out the way he expected it to either. Though I&rsquo;ve given you the short-and-sweet I don&rsquo;t have to be Michelangelo for you to see the whole picture I&rsquo;m painting. Devoted family. Busy at church. Crumbling faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow return to the idea of fa&ccedil;ades. The reason I didn&rsquo;t have to paint an elaborate picture for you in the last paragraph is because we&rsquo;ve all seen it. We may even be lulled into that false sense of security with our kids (or peers), thinking that as long as they are in church every possible minute, surrounded by Godly men and women mentors, busy doing the business of church, going on mission trips and working on service projects, volunteering at VBS, and tithing faithfully, they&rsquo;ll be alright. They&rsquo;re walking with God. But as a friend of mine pointed out to me not long ago, our kids (friends, peers, even mentors) can be good moral people, busy at church work and leading the charge, and still be headed straight to hell.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the case with my friend&rsquo;s son. What I think happened to him is he got Vegased. Even he thought that as long as he was busy doing church everything would be (would have been) alright. But when he stepped out of the church and into the world, the fa&ccedil;ade fell away and there was nothing real for him to hide behind. He had built a fa&ccedil;ade called&nbsp;works on a foundation of faith, but when tested by fire, the fa&ccedil;ade burned up and he was stripped right down to the bare bones of his reality. Exposed. Vulnerable. Incomplete. Unequipped. And mad.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy friend is praying for new construction to begin soon, but for now her son is a rickety shell of a lean-to and she&rsquo;s praying against a stiff wind. But the beauty is that though his crumbling fa&ccedil;ade has left a trail of destruction a mile wide behind him, God&nbsp;can build something <strong>real</strong> on the foundation that was laid long ago now that the fa&ccedil;ade has been demolished.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know you&rsquo;re probably waiting for the &ldquo;Well, Timmy&rdquo; here, but I don&rsquo;t really have one. That would require an answer that I&rsquo;m still searching for. On the other hand, at the surface level this is something I&rsquo;ve been talking about it for the last&hellip;well, seems like forever. Works don&rsquo;t get you anywhere with God. All they do is build up a fake front that convinces everyone, including you, that you&rsquo;re doing alright. But what I learned in Vegas is that if you look closely at a fa&ccedil;ade, you can see that it&rsquo;s just a shabby imitation of the real thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;<em>By </em>the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds. For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man&rsquo;s work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.&rdquo; </em>1 Corinthians 3:10-15<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

I wasn&#39;t Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, or anything else and my parents were Christian so I figured I was, too.</p>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<p>\n\tMy parents rooted for the Dallas Cowboys so... I rooted for the Dallas Cowboys.<br />\n\tMy parents drove GM cars so I drove GM cars.<br />\n\tMy parents ate meatloaf on Thursdays so I ate meatloaf on Thursdays.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy \"Christian\"-ness was simply an extension of choices my parents had made but I had no clue what it really meant to <em>be</em> a Christian.

As a result, I knew almost nothing about my Savior or His Word.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt appears that I was not alone in that \"<strong>Christian by default</strong>\" mindset.</p>\n<p>\n\tA recent CNN article entitled <em><a href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/05/thats-not-in-the-bible/\" mce_href=\"http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/05/thats-not-in-the-bible/\" target=\"_blank\">Actually, that&#39;s not in the Bible</a></em> makes the observation that Americans often quote \"phantom bible passages\" that really aren&#39;t part of Scripture:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t\"God works in mysterious ways.\"</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t\"Cleanliness is next to Godliness.\"</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t\"God helps those who help themselves.\"</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t\"Spare the rod, spoil the child.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tNone of these are actually quotes from the Bible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>But people rarely challenge them because biblical ignorance is so pervasive that it even reaches groups of people who should know better, says Steve Bouma-Prediger, a religion professor at Hope College in Holland, Michigan.<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t&ldquo;In my college religion classes, I sometimes quote 2 Hesitations 4:3 (&lsquo;There are no internal combustion engines in heaven&rsquo;),&rdquo; Bouma-Prediger says. &ldquo;I wait to see if anyone realizes that there is no such book in the Bible and therefore no such verse.<br />\n\t\t<br />\n\t\t&ldquo;Only a few catch on.&rdquo;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>But <em>why</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tBiblical Illiteracy</h2>\n<p>\n\tFor the past 50 years numerous groups have bemoaned the Biblical illiteracy that has gripped Christians in America. In 2008 The Associated for Biblical Research <a href=\"http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2008/09/Biblical-Illiteracy.aspx\" mce_href=\"http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2008/09/Biblical-Illiteracy.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">made this observation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>One of the most serious problems facing the Church in the 21st century is the problem of Biblical illiteracy. Simply put, most professing Christians do not possess a sound and coherent understanding of the Bible, beginning with sound doctrine and general Biblical history. Evidence for this sad reality is quite overwhelming.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThey go on to suggest these reasons are behind the decline:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tThe Church Has Been &ldquo;Dumbed Down&rdquo; by the Culture</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tThe Church Has Adopted the Cultural Mandate to &ldquo;Feel Good&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tThe Church Has Allowed Elements of Unbiblical Worldviews to Infect Its Teaching</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tGeorge Lindbeck, a famous Yale theologian, shared this sobering observation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\"When I first arrived at Yale, even those who came from nonreligious backgrounds knew the Bible better than most of those now who come from churchgoing families.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tTheologian and author David Wells made this point in his book <em>No Place for Truth</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\"I have watched with growing disbelief as the evangelical church has cheerfully plunged into astounding theological illiteracy.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tSadly, this illiteracy only appears to be deepening. As more and more people adopt the \"Christian by default\" mindset their concept of being Christian does not extend much beyond showing up at church on Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tChristian on Purpose</h2>\n<p>\n\tConsider what being \"Christian\" really means.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>Christ</em></strong>-ian = belonging to Christ: Christ-like.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris Tomlin&#39;s song \"I Will Follow\" puts this idea to music:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>Where you go, I&#39;ll go<br />\n\t\tWhere you stay, I&#39;ll stay<br />\n\t\tWhen you move, I&#39;ll move<br />\n\t\tI will follow you<br />\n\t\tWho you love, I&#39;ll love<br />\n\t\tHow you serve I&#39;ll serve<br />\n\t\tIf this life I lose, I will follow you</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIf that is how we desire to live then we must first learn where He went, where He stayed, who He loved, who He served, and how He lived. Almost 2,000 years ago He made this declaration:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily <strong>and follow Me</strong>. (Luke 9:23- emphasis mine)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we are going to follow Him and walk in His path then we should learn how He lived and how He walked. As a devout Jewish man in the first century, the Messiah lived a life of faith and purpose that few outside Orthodox Jewish communities of today can comprehend. That lack of comprehension and understanding of who Christ is results directly from ignorance of G-d&#39;s Word. G-d&#39;s Law (in Exodus through Deuteronomy) gives us a glimpse of the day-to-day details of&nbsp;Messiah&#39;s life.&nbsp; The whole Old Testament tells us about His nation... the nation in which He lived, in which He died, and which He served.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tGet Started</h2>\n<p>\n\tMy personal walk of faith began in August 1996 at Harvest Fellowship Community Church in San Antonio, TX.&nbsp; I don&#39;t remember the sermon that Sunday morning but I do remember the moment I became a believer.&nbsp; At the end of the service I realized that I wanted to be near G-d but I could <em><strong>never</strong></em> be good enough on my own because of my sin.&nbsp; I remember an overwhelming feeling of guilt and the weight of a burden I could not bear.&nbsp; Then the pastor repeated the Gospel message that I had heard a thousand times before: Jesus paid&nbsp;the penalty for my sin so I could be with Him forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;I literally wept, fell on my knees, and thanked G-d because I felt that burden and that weight lifted.&nbsp; That was the day appointed for my salvation and it still brings tears of joy to my eyes when I remember it.&nbsp; I decided on that day and in that moment that I would follow my Savior and Redeemer wherever He would lead me.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you cry out to G-d and He touches your heart and changes your life then <em><strong>be </strong></em>a Christian...<br />\n\t<strong>Be Christian on purpose.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHere is my patented 3-step process for combating Biblical illiteracy:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t\tRead the Word.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tPray.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tRepeat.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn today&#39;s age of PCs, Blackberry&#39;s, iPhones, and Android tablets we are a simple reminder away from spending 5 to 10 minutes every day in G-d&#39;s Word.&nbsp; Start with Genesis and read all the way through Revelation. If the \"so-and-so begat so-and-so\" sections of Genesis bore you to tears and the seemingly endless list of offerings in Numbers chapter 7 makes you want to run screaming from the room <strong>then skip them</strong> and keep going the next day. Those passages will become more valuable to you as your faith matures.</p>\n<p>\n\tA good commentary or Bible study will help you understand what some of the more difficult passages of Scripture mean. <a href=\"http://www.bsfinternational.org/\" mce_href=\"http://www.bsfinternational.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bible Study Fellowship (BSF)</a> meetings are one example of intense year-long studies that will grow your understanding of Scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you pray, don&#39;t simply ask G-d for things (even good things like patience, spiritual strength, and courage). Pray passages of Scripture that extol the greatness of G-d. Psalm 145, Psalm 30, and Psalm 119 are my personal favorites. In reflecting on how great and awesome G-d is we often find that our perspective on our own lives and concerns changes dramatically!</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Don&#39;t expect instant results.</strong> A solid walk of faith and Biblical literacy is a lifelong journey that does not match our \"one minute in the microwave\" culture. Find a good \"read the Bible in a year\" list and stick with it. Don&#39;t get discouraged if you miss a day or two... or ten. If you get off track just pick up with the current day&#39;s reading and keep going!</p>\n<p>\n\tI wanted to share one last quote from that CNN article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>&ldquo;Most people who profess a deep love of the Bible have never actually read the book,&rdquo; says Rabbi Rami Shapiro, who once had to persuade a student in his Bible class at Middle Tennessee State University that the saying &ldquo;this dog won&rsquo;t hunt&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t appear in the Book of Proverbs.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tDon&#39;t be Christian by default.</p>\n<p>\n\t&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n"

It&rsquo;s supernatural how often God uses him to speak directly to my circumstances with a wisdom that I desperately need and am not able to find elsewhere. Sometimes God speaks through him to give me a heads up. In one of his devotions Os wrote, \"To be certain of God means that we are uncertain in all our ways, we do not know what a day may bring forth.\" OK, that&rsquo;s cool all by itself but when paired with the verse he used, it is magical.</p>\n<p>\n\t1 John 3:1a, 2 reads, <em>&ldquo;How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.&rdquo; </em></p>\n<p>\n\tThink back, way back, if necessary, to a time in your life when you made no plans. It may seem impossible to remember, but that time existed for us all. It was probably when you were a toddler or a very young child. That was a time when all your days were orchestrated by someone bigger, stronger and wiser than you were, and you were completely at peace waking every day without knowing one thing that lay ahead. You were uncertain in all your ways because you were completely dependent on the adults in your life to tell you when to get up, when to get dressed, when to eat your meals, when to take your naps, when to play, when to go, when to stay. You never took time to reason that they were in charge and that you were safe in their care. And sadly, you were completely unaware of your own freedom in not knowing what the day may bring forth.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat&rsquo;s what it is supposed to be like to be a child of God. Care free. No plans of our own apart from Him. Complete uncertainty. Trusting Him without having to decide to. Free to move when He calls. Able to rest when it&rsquo;s nap-time. Eating the meal He has put in front of us without considering the next one.&nbsp; How great a love is that? A lavish love! Now we are children of God. Who knows what we will be tomorrow? We are summer-time free, and all that is certain is God.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tIn 2008 shock and sadness accompanied the death of 3-year old <strong>Caylee Anthony</strong>, as indeed it should for the senseless death of any child. For some individuals that sense of sadness and the desire for justice appears to have turned into bitterness, anger, and the pursuit of vengeance. The trial of Caylee&#39;s mother, Casey Anthony, has captured the attention of many Americans and left some believers confused and conflicted.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs always, believers should turn to the Living Word of G-d for guidance, strength, and encouragement in these situations.</p>\n<h2>\n\tJustice</h2>\n<p>\n\tIn Deuteronomy 16:20 G-d commands His people,</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"Justice, justice, you shall pursue, that you may have life and possess the land which the LORD your G-d is giving you.\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThis verse lists two things that are the consequence of pursuing justice:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t\tlife</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tpossession of the Land of Israel</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tMessiah declared that <strong>He </strong>is the Way, the Truth, and <strong>the Life</strong>. (John 14:6)<br />\n\tIf we pursue justice then we are pursuing Him.<br />\n\tIf we do not pursue justice then we are not pursuing Him.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>When the ancient Israelites ceased to seek justice then they also ceased to seek G-d. </strong>When that occurred the second benefit of the commandment (possession of the Land) was also lost.</p>\n<p>\n\tG-d was the One Who enabled the Israelites to remain in the land in the face of their enemies. It was He Who gave them strength and victory in battle and peace afterwards. When the Israelites ceased to pursue justice and pursue G-d then He ceased to protect them from their enemies and they were driven out of the Land. Initially it was the northern kingdom of Israel in the Assyrian captivity (1 Chron 5:26, 2 Kings 15:29, 2 Kings 17:3-6, 2 Kings 18:11-12) and then later it was the southern kingdom of Judah in the Babylonian captivity (2 Chron 36:5-8, 2 Kings 25:1-4, Jer 39:1-8).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe citizens of Florida <strong>should </strong>pursue justice in the Casey Anthony trial (and in every trial) and in doing so they will in some small measure reflect G-d&#39;s righteous justice.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tVengeance</h2>\n<p>\n\tThe news media has reported stories across the country that many who are attending or watching the Casey Anthony trial \"want to see justice done for little Caylee\" and believe her mother should receive the death sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe death sentence?</p>\n<p>\n\tShouldn&#39;t we first discover through examination of witnesses and evidence whether or not she is <strong>guilty</strong>? It seems that some have jumped straight to a guilty verdict and want Ms. Anthony put to death. That is not justice... that is vengeance.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the Bible supports the death penalty in the case of murder (Exodus 21:12, Leviticus 24:17, Numbers 35:15-31) it also requires a trial by judge (Deuteronomy 16:18, 1:16) who must have the evidence of two or more witnesses in any case involving the death penalty (Deuteronomy 17:6).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe <strong>judges </strong>must <strong>judge </strong>guilt or innocence in a <strong>trial </strong>in order to render <strong>justice</strong>. That is even the pattern that G-d will follow at the last judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf anyone bypasses the judicial process then they are pursuing vengeance... and G-d forbids that:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>You shall <strong>not</strong> take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the LORD.</em> (Leviticus 19:18)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tG-d places \"loving your neighbor as yourself\" (the second greatest commandment) at the opposite end of the spectrum from taking vengeance.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile G-d <strong>does</strong> command the Israelites to take vengeance upon the Midianites (Numbers 31:2) it is <strong>His </strong>vengeance they are delivering (verse 3) not their own.</p>\n<p>\n\tG-d also tells us through the Apostle Paul,</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, \"VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,\" says the Lord.</em> (Romans 12:19)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tBelievers should <strong>not </strong>pursue vengeance in this matter or any other. It may not be easy when we are filled with righteous anger at the death of a child but with G-d all things are possible.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tMercy</h2>\n<p>\n\tSome believers may lament the apparent lack of mercy in this situation. \"Even if she is guilty\", they say, \"shouldn&#39;t we show her mercy as Christ showed us mercy?\"</p>\n<p>\n\tThey sometimes bring up the story of the woman caught in adultery as an example but often overlook the complete picture of that specific event. Let&#39;s briefly examine what occurred:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tMessiah is in the Temple teaching (John 8:2).</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSome scribes the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery and challenge Him saying, \"In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?\" (John 8:4).</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tHis response is \"He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.\" (John 8:7)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tLet&#39;s put this into modern terms:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tImagine your pastor is teaching a Bible study in a public place.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tA couple of policemen barge in with a suspect who has been charged with a crime worthy of the death penalty and ask the pastor what should be done with her.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tThe pastor responds, \"Let her have her day in court to face her accusers and witnesses against her.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe pastor in the midst of a Bible study would have no authority to judge the accused person... even if the pastor also happened to be a judge. A judge should try the matter in a court of law. The pastor isn&#39;t showing the accused person mercy. He is pursuing justice and obeying the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, Messiah&#39;s response in John chapter 8 is not one of mercy but of justice. The scribes and Pharisees are testing Him to determine if He is a law-keeper or a law-breaker (John 8:6). Messiah follows the law and calls for witnesses to come forth to \"cast the first stone\".</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The woman is not set free because she was found guilty and then shown mercy but because there were no witnesses who testified against her and she was found innocent!</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, believers who are following the Casey Anthony trial should allow events to unfold and justice to be pursued.</p>\n"

I can&rsquo;t begin to outline it all here, but this one was important. Let&rsquo;s see if I can illustrate.</p>\n<p>\n\tDo you have a fashion magazine lying around somewhere? Look at the cover. (Guys, you&rsquo;ll have to insert your personal envy-poison here whether it&rsquo;s a hot-rod or a power tool.) Beyond admiring what you see on the cover, do you begin an instant inventory of comparison? My inner dialogue usually says, &ldquo;I wish I had her hair&rdquo;, &ldquo;I wish I were that thin&rdquo;, &ldquo;I wonder if Goodwill has that dress&rdquo;. It isn&rsquo;t conscious and it only goes on long enough for me to find myself an utter failure in comparison and hide the magazine.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThis, my friends, is the purpose of the Law. Law, capital <strong>L</strong> as in, you are a <strong>L</strong>-oser! (Insert picture of me holding my finger and thumb against my forehead.) Read this:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;<em>But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead. Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death</em>.&rdquo; Romans 7:8-11</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Law is our Christian fashion-rag glamour doll meant to make us feel like Kathy of cartoon fame. (Or for you guys, Tim the Tool man Taylor to Bob Villa.) Paul goes on to say that the Law isn&rsquo;t bad just because it makes us aware of what a failure we are, but indeed we would not know what is bad or good if it weren&rsquo;t for the Law.&nbsp;The purpose of the Law was to paint a picture of sinless perfection, and the picture there is of Jesus, not me. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tEnter Adam and Eve. Did it ever occur to you to wonder why they didn&rsquo;t know they were naked until they ate from the tree of the&nbsp;<em><strong>knowledge </strong></em>of good and evil? Until then they never had any reason to look at themselves*. There was no comparison, no standard, and no expectation except to walk with God in the cool of the evening. Once they had <em><strong>knowledge</strong></em> of the two opposing forces, there was comparison, and comparison almost always becomes self-focused. We begin to ask ourselves, &lsquo;Who cares what two things look like opposed to each other, what do I look like compared to them both?&rsquo; We weigh and measure, and if we&rsquo;re honest with ourselves, we come out on the losing end every time. No matter how we might justify.</p>\n<p>\n\tPart of what God is teaching me is that I don&rsquo;t want to fix my hair, and buy that dress, and lose 10 pounds in order to be a sorry imitation of the real thing. I&rsquo;m tired of being <em><strong>determined</strong></em> to stop speeding, or swearing when I&rsquo;m mad, or saying unkind things in haste and irritation. I don&rsquo;t want to <em><strong>resolve</strong></em> to love more, sacrifice everything, and pick up my cross.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n\tI. Am. Tired. Of. <em><strong>Me</strong></em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n\tI will never look like that. I can never do those things. Only Christ can.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n\tI don&rsquo;t want to be <em><strong>like</strong></em> Christ.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n\tI want Christ to <em><strong>BE.</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tI think there is only one way for that to happen and that is to return to the truth before the apple (or whatever the fruit was, let&rsquo;s not quibble). The truth then was that life and breath was simply to walk with God in the cool of the evening. There is simply no reason to look at myself when I know what I will see. There is only One who deserves my attention. Everything else is less. Everything else is <em>loss</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\t*This epiphany brought to you courtesy of <em>Grace Walk</em>, Steve McVey.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tOne of my favorite Christian songs is by Keith and Kristyn Getty, called &ldquo;In Christ Alone&rdquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a beautiful hymn that has the gospel message, and exalts our Lord Jesus.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one particular stanza in the song that really catches my attention:</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tTill on that cross as Jesus died,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tThe wrath of God was satisfied;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tFor ev&#39;ry sin on Him was laid&mdash;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tHere in the death of Christ I live.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWe often forget about the wrath of God.&nbsp; While God has many attributes about which He tells us in Scripture, the church today tends to focus primarily on God&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; I find that most Christians don&rsquo;t like to talk about God&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp; Of course, wrath is a logical result of God&rsquo;s attribute of justice.&nbsp; Again, this is an aspect about the gospel that many Christians are either ignorant or don&rsquo;t want to discuss.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tBut the fact that God is just is why the gospel means &ldquo;good news&rdquo;.&nbsp; Because God is just, He must punish sin.&nbsp; God is not some cosmic grandpa who simply overlooks sin because He&rsquo;s a &ldquo;nice guy&rdquo;.&nbsp; While it&rsquo;s true that God does not take pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 33:11), He nonetheless must punish sin because that is the definition of justice.&nbsp; Scripture makes it clear that He will punish everyone&rsquo;s sin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tHow does He punish a Christian&rsquo;s sin, you might ask?&nbsp; We often hear that God will forgive our sin if we have personal relationship with Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Yet, as someone has rightly said, <em>everyone</em> has a personal relationship with God.&nbsp; Some will be forgiven for their sins (Christians), while everyone else will experience God&rsquo;s wrath as punishment for their sin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tHowever, even Christians&rsquo; sins are punished.&nbsp; The good news is that Jesus willingly took this punishment on Himself, and gave us His righteousness.&nbsp; Romans 5 puts describes this clearly:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t&ldquo;<em>6 For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.&nbsp; 7 For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.&nbsp; 8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&nbsp; 9 Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.&nbsp; 10 For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.&nbsp; 11 And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tWe were saved from God&rsquo;s wrath, His just wrath that we deserved, because of the blood of Christ.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s wrath was poured out on Christ on the cross.&nbsp; Moreover, He did this for us while we were His enemies!&nbsp; Now that is good news!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tAs the Getty&rsquo;s point out in their hymn, we live because of the death of Christ, a death that came because of God&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp; Again, this is the good new of the gospel.&nbsp; As the Getty&rsquo;s go on to point out, sin&rsquo;s curse has no grip on us, for we have been bought with the precious blood of Christ:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tThere in the ground His body lay,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tLight of the world by darkness slain;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tThen bursting forth in glorious day,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tUp from the grave He rose again!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tAnd as He stands in victory,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tSin&#39;s curse has lost its grip on me;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tFor I am His and He is mine&mdash;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\tBought with the precious blood of Christ.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tGiven this good news, may we do as Hebrews 12 commands:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\t&ldquo;<em>1 Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2 fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tTwo weeks ago the Lord met with my friend Art and gave him a message that he thought no one would be listening to. Art, being a humble and obedient man of God, brought that message to our beginning Bible students&rsquo; class this week not knowing that the message was for me. Did you catch that? Two weeks ago, God gave Art a message that I needed Tuesday. God has been leading me along on an issue lately (which will sound very familiar to you, being a theme that runs through my life) and I was stuck, but Art&rsquo;s obedience un-stuck me.</p>\n<p>\n\tDeep breath here and a roll of the eyes as we begin. Works. Again with the works. Yeah, it&rsquo;s a tired old thesis but I guess it shouldn&rsquo;t surprise me that I struggle here. Lots of other folks throughout history seem to have had the same problem, like the Galatians for example. But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. Let me set the stage.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis time of year is always difficult for me. All the busy work I&rsquo;ve been doing is beginning to wrap up and I find myself at sixes and eights. I&rsquo;m going to be brutally honest with you &ndash; which is easier to do since I can&rsquo;t see the judgment on your face, which I would surely have for you if it were your confession &ndash; this time of the year I find myself tired and mad. Tired because I&rsquo;ve been running and doing. Mad because I&rsquo;ve been running and doing. Also mad because by comparison, there are those who don&rsquo;t seem to be running anywhere or doing much. And mad because everyone else is running and doing like mad and seem to be missing the point while they drive us ever onward in their fury to get somewhere. That&rsquo;s my sad ugly confession, except that until Art spoke the words of the Lord, I thought that what I was feeling was righteous indignation. After all, aren&rsquo;t we supposed to be running and doing, and doing some more and running somewhere else? Aren&rsquo;t we single-handedly supposed to being going into ALL the world because where we are simply isn&rsquo;t needy enough (and really, God needed me in Africa but He made a mistake by putting me in Northwest Arkansas)? But then, aren&rsquo;t we also supposed to be relying on grace, not just for salvation but for sanctification as well?? And if that&rsquo;s true then when can I stop running? Because I&rsquo;m tired. The prevailing message in the evangelical community of late is that we&rsquo;re supposed to be radical, crazy, irresistible, relentless and revolutionary. I can&rsquo;t do that sitting at home with a Bible in my lap relying on grace, right? But I&rsquo;m tired. And I&rsquo;m failing. And if I quit, what will people say?? I know what the busy ones will say. &ldquo;Get up.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do something.&rdquo; Because that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing. And if they have to, you have to. That was my thinking.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I have all this conflicting emotion swirling around in my head and I&rsquo;m too tired to give the needed effort to really sort it out - and this wasn&rsquo;t a red flag for me? I know. I know. I&rsquo;ve been completely off the rails again, and asking myself a la David Byrne, &ldquo;How did I get here?&rdquo; (Same as it ever was!) In the midst of this ongoing internal rant my husband and I found an oasis of time under a shade tree in the yard on Sunday. It was extremely windy but a beautiful day otherwise. We were sitting there quietly together just enjoying the day when I noticed two contradictory images in my field of vision. Way up in the&nbsp;sky was a bird that was beating himself half silly trying to fly against the wind&hellip;and getting no where. It would pause for a moment, attempting to coast, but would immediately be buffeted by a gale and have to start up the furious flapping again just to maintain its place in the air. Never gaining any ground (so to speak), just working like crazy. Trying (gasp). To Get (gasp). Somewhere (gasp).</p>\n<p>\n\tOut of my periphery, I could also see a little yellow butterfly flitting along and making good headway. It was caught up the same gale-force wind that the bird was thrashing mercilessly, but the butterfly, letting itself be carried along,&nbsp;was getting somewhere. I wondered at the science of that. How is it possible for that tiny little thing, so light that you could barely feel it if you held it in your hand , to be strong enough to actually reach its destination against such formidable odds, when the much stronger (much more determined) bird was losing the battle? I pointed out the spectacle to my husband and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an article for Verse by Verse in that&rdquo;. I just couldn&rsquo;t get hold of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday evening I was still puzzling the phenomenon and I knew that this was God speaking to my questionable attitudes. I also knew that those foolish Galatians probably had something to contribute to the dialogue. So I read their letter. I heard Paul&rsquo;s tongue lashing, like I always do and&nbsp;since God has brought me a mighty long way in my personal struggle with works (believe it or not) I kept telling the Lord as I read, &ldquo;I <em><strong>know</strong></em> this. I <em><strong>got</strong></em> this. I <em><strong>get</strong></em> it.&rdquo; But I also knew I was missing something.</p>\n<p>\n\tEnter my friend Art (and bless him, Jesus!). Art brought us a short little message from &ndash; drum roll please &ndash; Galatians. I won&rsquo;t be able to quote what he said exactly but I can tell you what I heard. I heard that work is opposed to the fruit of the Spirit. In the presence of much work is the absence of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control. What work produces is competition and comparison, and that breeds jealousy, contempt, resentment and pride. Love can&rsquo;t exist in that atmosphere. It abhors that attitude. Strife is discordant with fruit. Work makes you a bird and not a butterfly.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn John 3:8 Jesus tells Nicodemus that, &ldquo;<em>The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.</em>\" I&rsquo;m sure that every intellectual theologian who might still be reading this will have a deeper, truer and more astute commentary on this than the one I&rsquo;m about to make, but I take it as He gives it. This verse&nbsp;desribes what it looks like to be the butterfly. I am only free to go with the Spirit if I&rsquo;ve freed myself up from trying. To get. Somewhere.</p>\n<p>\n\tCharles Schulz has the best visual for the path of one who moves where the wind blows. If you&rsquo;ve ever read a Peanuts strip you can visualize the dotted line rambling across the panel in swirls and loops and hills and valleys, always forward, but with a few detours along the way. It&rsquo;s the easy, carefree sort of rambling that we all say we will do when we retire. We&rsquo;ll take the side-roads instead of the highway. We won&rsquo;t book reservations in advance. We&rsquo;ll go where the wind takes us. So, why not now?</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;ve spent some time talking with the Lord about what this actually looks like and if it&rsquo;s even possible, or right, to live unfettered by our own plans and goals and hopeful destinations. In the midst of the conversation, a dear friend of mine had to be admitted to the hospital, and as it so happens, I didn&rsquo;t have any plans of my own for two whole days. I was completely free to be at her disposal. They were two of the most enjoyable days (for me, anyway) that I can remember in a long, long time.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;m not sure where this wind will blow from here, but if this week has been any indication, I&rsquo;m sure that the Lord has big plans for me, and plenty to keep me occupied. I&rsquo;m going to relax really hard so that I can be the butterfly and let the Spirit take me where He will, and not be the bird beating myself and my calendar into submission. Then, maybe then, I actually can get somewhere that matters.</p>\n<p>\n\t<u>Post Script </u>&ndash; Before I posted this I read Brian Smith&rsquo;s most excellent article on <em><u>The Persecuted Church</u></em>. I could get a real inferiority complex posting next to him if I gave it any thought at all, but let me just tie my post to his momentarily by asking a simple question. How can we possibly hear the voice of God, and obey the call of God to the point of persecution while we&rsquo;re running around trying to get somewhere of our own choosing, on our own agenda, in our own timing? In the Western Church, we&rsquo;re often awfully busy telling God what we&rsquo;re going to accomplish for Him when, if we would stop working long enough to listen to the Holy Spirit, He would lead us in a different direction. That direction may look a lot more like carefree poverty and persecution than we&rsquo;re comfortable with, but would actually get somewhere against a mighty wind of opposition.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>\"If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another.\" </em>Galatians 5:26-26<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tI don&rsquo;t know about you, but living here in America, I have not personally been subject to much persecution for my faith.&nbsp; The persecution I have experienced has certainly not been what I would call life threatening.&nbsp; Part of this is surely due to America&rsquo;s Christian heritage.&nbsp; Unlike most countries, Americans generally accept Christianity, as they tend to be familiar with it.&nbsp; Perhaps part of it is also related to me not being as effective a witness for the Lord as I could be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tMany of our brothers and sisters in Christ, however, are subject to persecution, often life threatening, as many die for their faith.&nbsp; A good friend recently attended a Christian conference, and this person shared some interesting facts that I thought were not only interesting, but also convicting, so I list them below.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t80% of believers globally who practice their faith live in an environment of persecution.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tThroughout Scripture, persecution is as normal as the sun coming up.&nbsp; 12 out of 28 chapters in the book of Acts has leaders in jail for their witness about Jesus, 14 other chapters have overt persecution.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tWhen a believer goes to jail for his faith, he cannot take his bible, praise music, pastor&#39;s CDs, and church building with him.&nbsp; What they take is the Holy Spirit and if they have no awareness of Him or daily communication from Him, they will be cut-off from God.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tWhen Christians are obedient to the calling to be bold and faithful witnesses, they will cause persecution.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tThe husband of the family is not the image of God given to protect the family, but rather the servant of God who must sometimes lead them into the fire to obey the will of God.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tWe are most like New Testament Christians when we publicly witness about Jesus, not when we are most known for our social agendas.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t183 million people among 40 unreached people groups in Africa and the Middle East have no one working among them.&nbsp; God has commanded us to go to the nations, not just the ones that say, \"yes\" or the ones that like us.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;\">\n\t\tThe litmus test for church leadership in China is not gifting, talent, or education, but having experienced persecution for their witness.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t\"We have a culture here in our country [America] that says it is ok to send our young people to die for the sake of the country, but it is not ok to send our sons and daughters to die for the sake of Jesus.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;\">\n\t\t\"If your local body of believers hasn&#39;t had anyone in the previous 12 months: refused for promotion, fired from their job, corrected by an authority, or harassed by a co-worker for talking about Jesus, then it is possible your church is serving the American Dream, rather than Jesus the Messiah.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tOuch.&nbsp; Are we part of the 80% that are being persecuted?&nbsp; Are we known more for our faith in Christ, or for our &ldquo;social&rdquo; agendas?&nbsp; Why do we try to save the planet when God has told us it&rsquo;s going to burn up completely one day (2 Peter 3:10)?&nbsp; What do we look for in a pastor:&nbsp; education, attended the right seminary, speaks well?&nbsp; What a difference it would make in the un-Biblical seeker sensitive churches if they were filled with pastors who had been persecuted for their faith in Christ!&nbsp; Surely those churches would lose membership quickly if Christ were preached instead of &ldquo;felt needs&rdquo;!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tThere&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being politically or socially active.&nbsp; Remember, though, that we are aliens; this is not our home.&nbsp; Like Abraham, we are seeking a city whose architect and builder is God (Hebrews 11:10).&nbsp; We should never let such concerns outweigh our work for Christ.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tSo, what does this persecution look like?&nbsp; One example I have comes from the Voice of the Martyrs (VOM) magazine.&nbsp; This sister of ours is named Yubelina.&nbsp; Her picture is shown here, after she was persecuted.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t<span style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><img alt=\"The persecuted church\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Yubelina.png\" style=\"width: 332px; height: 433px; float: right; margin: 10px;\" /><span style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tYubelina is a Christian who was burned in a fire when her Indonesian village was attacked by Muslims.&nbsp; She was persecuted for her faith, yet she did not deny her Savior.&nbsp; Admittedly, it&rsquo;s hard to look at her face, because we aren&rsquo;t used to seeing such damage.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not normal.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s amazing, though, is the smile on her face.&nbsp; Clearly, Yubelina knows we are here only temporarily; surely she is looking forward to her heavenly body, knowing she can trust God&rsquo;s promises.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tVOM ran Yubelina&rsquo;s picture on the cover of their January newsletter.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s sad is that they received complaints from some readers who were offended by Yubelina&rsquo;s picture.&nbsp; Some said it was &ldquo;nightmarish&rdquo;, &ldquo;ghoulish&rdquo;.&nbsp; Some asked to be removed from their mailing list.&nbsp; My guess is they were all Americans.&nbsp; I wonder is they would also have been offended at the appearance of our Lord on the cross.&nbsp; Isaiah 52:14 tells us that &ldquo;His appearance was marred more than any man And His form more than the sons of men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jesus set the example of what <strong>the persecuted church</strong> would look like.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tHow sad that a Christian would be offended by a picture of a persecuted sister in Christ.&nbsp; Rather, we should be convicted, at least those of us who have not been subject to such persecution.&nbsp; Scripture says we will experience trials, and that we should consider it all joy when this happens (James 1:2-3).&nbsp; Indeed, Scripture encourages us to endure, for most of us &ldquo;have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood&rdquo; (Hebrews 12:4).&nbsp; When the apostles were jailed for their faith, they rejoiced &ldquo;that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name&rdquo; (Acts 5:41).&nbsp; Maybe that&rsquo;s why Yubelina is smiling.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\tMay the Lord give us all the same boldness that we who have not been persecuted would glorify God by preaching Christ.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tHaving just returned from a fast and furious week of Bible teaching to pastors in India, I am pleased to report that the Church is thriving in the capable hands of our Indian brothers and sisters. I was a guest speaker and teacher at the <strong>Feed My Lambs Ministries</strong> (FMLM) annual pastors conference near Bangalore, India, where I presented a short course on hermenuetics and preached several sermons on Christ as a servant Leader. I sought to inspire these pastors and other church leaders to center their ministries on His word, but after a week watching the Spirit working in these believers, I was the one inspired by their excitement and passion for the word.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I&#39;ve seen in the Unites States and elsewhere recently, the Spirit is moving in India to raise up pastors and teachers from outside the mainline denominations and traditional seminary programs. These nontraditional leaders have been called to fill the void created after many traditional Christian programs departed from teaching and preaching God&#39;s word. I am so excited to watch the Spirit purify His Church in India and elsewhere, and it gives me great hope for what may come from this new wave of ministry rooted in God&#39;s word.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"Feed My Lambs Ministries\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/photo.JPG\" style=\"margin: 15px 10px; width: 500px; height: 373px;\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tWe partnered with FMLM during this conference because they share our vision to deliver deep, methodical Biblical education to every Christian, regardless of role or position. Regrettably, the modern view of discipleship produces an unbiblical division between clergy (i.e., those who pursue a dedicated seminary program and are ordained) and the rest of the congregation, who are taught to depend on their clergy&#39;s Biblical knowledge for their spiritual maturity. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the Bible does provide for different roles within the Body of Christ (e.g., pastors, teachers, etc.), it never suggests that these different roles should have different goals for Biblical knowledge and spiritual maturity. &nbsp;On the contrary, the Bible says all believers are to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ (2Peter 3:18). Therefore, we should teach all believers to a similar depth of knowledge, and we should exhort all believers to pursue Biblical education with equal fervor and dedication.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a sense, every Christian should seek a seminary education...or go beyond what seminaries offer, since many seminaries have retreated from delivering a Biblically-sound education. Equally important, pastors should continue to seek Bible training and instruction even after they attain their pastoral positions. Every pastor should remain a student, constantly seeking a higher understanding of Scripture even as he endeavors to teach others.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll believers are called upon to obtain spiritual maturity and to engage in a life-long pursuit of Biblical knowledge. Though some believers are gifted to teach, all are expected to learn (<em>see Heb 5:11 - 6:3),</em>&nbsp;and so our ministry is partnering with others like FMLM to promote serious, Biblical education for all believers. We pray the Lord will be pleased with our direction.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s May. Everyone I know is in the midst of making big decisions or having last minute doubts about the decisions they&rsquo;ve made. These are no small things we&rsquo;re wrestling with. They&rsquo;re things that determine the influence of our days, the outcome of our lives, whether we stay on the path or end up in a ditch. We seek God&rsquo;s face &ndash; we want him to turn toward our decisions and smile so that we know we&rsquo;ve chosen well, but we&rsquo;ll take a frown if it means we avoid stumbling. The problem is that we want our answers now. We don&rsquo;t want them on the brink of the very last moment. In our haste and anxiety we behave toward God&rsquo;s answers like we demonstrate patience with hot pizza.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou understand the concept - you know that you shouldn&rsquo;t take that bite without allowing a little time to pass, but it looks so good! And it hurts so bad! The cheese sticks to the roof of your mouth and leaves a blistering pain that causes you to loose whatever table manners your Momma taught you. Even though you desperately want to chew and swallow you simply can&rsquo;t put out the conflagration long enough to function and, splut, out it comes on your plate. (A friend of mine calls it Napalm cheese!) Now that bite now looks anything but appetizing and you have no taste buds left to really enjoy the flavor you have been anticipating. It&rsquo;s a mess and a disappointment that leaves you wishing you had waited and learned to savor the tension, the expectancy, the pregnant pause before the conditions had reached their zenith.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is something to be said for that kind of hopeful suspense but we just can&rsquo;t stand the lack of motion. We must act or die from the tension of waiting. And it is in that premature movement that we get burned. God&rsquo;s timing is perfect. I know you hear that as a clich&eacute; but you know it to be true. Do you know that there are 17 verses in the Old Testament that tell us specifically to wait for the Lord? There are many other stories that teach the principle, often from the perspective of those who waited like they&rsquo;d wait for hot pizza if they had it. The other side of haste is usually self-inflicted pain. So, in this busy busy month of May, a month of endings and beginnings, wait for the Lord! Be strong! Take heart! And wait for the Lord. Or risk getting blistered and burned.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tWe have a bluebird house outside our sunroom window. To my husband&rsquo;s chagrin, the only residents we&rsquo;ve had since putting it up have been sparrows. Many, many sparrows - all from the same family, most likely. The little couple got an early start this year, and yesterday we saw the first of many babies take flight. They flew as far as our bedroom window ledge where they huddled together (two of them) and peeped desperately for further instructions. There they roosted all night long, waking before dawn to begin their hungry peeping protest in earnest.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we sat at the bedroom window and watched them last night I wished that I could capture the image of the babies on the ledge peeping madly while just beyond them on the patio table Daddy perched with a still-wiggling grub in his beak. Enticing. Inviting. Listening. I knew there was a lesson there, but it took me until this morning to really get to the heart of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy son and a friend got into a very public argument via Facebook. Are you rolling your eyes? Ah, yes. Welcome to life with a teenager. The resulting consequences have yet to play out today and I&rsquo;m perched by the phone anxiously awaiting that call from the principal&rsquo;s office while praying without ceasing for God to work in the circumstances. The problem is - I&rsquo;m his mom. My prayers for him are not quite as bold as those I&rsquo;m inclined to pray for someone else&rsquo;s child. Though I have the same desire for all of our children &ndash; that they would walk with God and know Him fully &ndash; I don&rsquo;t want&nbsp;MY son&nbsp;to suffer in order to learn the lesson. Here&rsquo;s where the peeping begins.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I was wrestling with God this morning over my son&rsquo;s situation, my own worry, and my inability to let go of my will in favor of God&#39;s, I got an email from a close friend asking me to pray over some specific circumstances for her son. As I replied to her email, assuring her that I was with her in prayer, I realized that I needed help too. Major help. PEEP. After I asked her for her prayers in return, I told her that I could see the two of us hand in hand at the throne of Grace lifting up the other&rsquo;s prayers. PEEP. And I told her that it reminded me of the two little chicks on my window ledge peeping their hearts out to their Daddy. PEEP PEEP!</p>\n<p>\n\tIn God&rsquo;s Word, He not only commands us to pray without ceasing and to be anxious for nothing, but by His very nature He invites us and entices us to pray. He is the love we need. He is the comfort we desire. He is the peace in our circumstances. He is our assurance and our hope. He is a strong tower where the righteous (and the cowards) run for cover. He is. He is. I hate to say it, but He&rsquo;s Daddy bird with a big fat grub and all we have to do is fly to him to get it. But sometimes we aren&rsquo;t strong enough to get there, and we need someone to huddle up next to us and PEEP their hearts out on our behalf.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, here&rsquo;s hoping you have some &lsquo;peeps&rsquo; who will PEEP with you at the throne. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for their help to pray God&rsquo;s will into being when you don&rsquo;t have the faith to fly on. God is waiting with good things for those who PEEP.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;<em>Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!</em> \" Matthew 7:7-11<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tIn December, 2010, I had the great privilege of going on a mission trip to Costa Rica with one of my best friends.&nbsp; He is involved with a ministry there that primarily serves the Cabecar Indians, who are native to Costa Rica.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tThe Cabecars live on a relatively large reservation in the eastern part of Costa Rica.&nbsp; Some have horses and some have cars, but most walk to wherever they are going.&nbsp; It is not that easy to walk there, as the land is very hilly/mountainous, and the large amount of rainfall they receive keeps everything muddy much of the time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing to walk 3-4 hours somewhere on a given day.&nbsp; For the most part, the Cabecars are reliant on crops they grow themselves for their sustenance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tWhile there, I got to hear the testimony one of our brothers in Christ, Alejandro.&nbsp; He is a Cabecar, and told us before the Lord chose him, how he would participate in the annual pilgrimage to the local witch doctor, for lack of a better term.&nbsp; This person was the intermediary between the Cabecar god, Sibo (or Sibu), and the Cabecars; a sort of &ldquo;priest&rdquo;, if you will.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tOur brother explained how each year, a group of men would raise money to take to the priest as part of their annual pilgrimage, which was about a 16 hour walk.&nbsp; The motivation to bring money to the priest was, in essence, bribery.&nbsp; The priest threatened to have Sibo withhold rain, or do something that would harm their crops.&nbsp; Sibo had to be appeased, and only the priest could appease him.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great little system &ndash; if you&rsquo;re the priest.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tOver time, Alejandro began to realize that the pilgrimage was nothing but an excuse to go on a several day drinking binge.&nbsp; Some of the money they were taking to the priest would be used for alcohol, and the group would simply get drunk as they made their way to see the priest.&nbsp; He also realized that the priest had special idols for use in worship that supposedly had special powers.&nbsp; Of course, no one but the priest could see or handle these idols.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tAs it turns out, this was the beginning of the Lord bringing Alejandro to Himself.&nbsp; Eventually, at a missionary&rsquo;s home who lives on the Cabecar reservation, he heard the word of God read, and became a believer.&nbsp; This was the second generation of a missionary family who God led to devote their lives to the Cabecars.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tSo, what&rsquo;s the point of all of this?&nbsp; To demonstrate (yet again) that no matter where you go in the world, whether in a major pagan American city or in the deepest jungle of Costa Rica, God&rsquo;s word is proven true.&nbsp; Romans 1 says,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t&ldquo;<em>18For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, 19because that which is known about God is evident within them; for God made it evident to them.&nbsp; 20For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.&nbsp; 21For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.&nbsp; 22Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.&nbsp; 24Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.&nbsp; 25For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tIt also demonstrates that God is actively at work to the ends of the earth to bring His elect to Himself.&nbsp; In Alejandro&rsquo;s case, He did this through a family that has been with the Cabecars over 40 years.&nbsp; Our God&rsquo;s purposes cannot be thwarted, and His word does not return void.&nbsp; Despite our sin and rebellion against the all holy God, He saves us because of His great love.&nbsp; Ephesians 2 says,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t&ldquo;<em>1And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, 2in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.&nbsp; 3Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.&nbsp; 4But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 5even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 6and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; 8For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.&nbsp; 10For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tMay it please the Lord to work through us to bring many more to Him.</p>\n"

But there is a power at work within and all around us if we are brave enough to grab hold of it. If you find yourself daring to believe it, go on and reach up. But be sure to give a warning to those around you in case He blows you out of your boots.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tLiving in these tulmutuous and uncertain times, many Christians&#39; are turning their attention to the ends times teaching of the Bible hoping to find answers. In particular, many believers are asking if the events in our world today suggest that the end of the age is near.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn chapter 24 of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus addresses a series of similar questions from his disciples concerning the end of the age and the circumstances surrounding His promised return. The disciples were naturally seeking clues to the Lord&#39;s return, so they asked Jesus what would be the \"signs\" of the end of the age leading to His return.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn His answer, Jesus offers a tantilizing and provocative answer that sheds light on our present time. First, Jesus clarifies for us what are NOT signs of His return:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 24:4&nbsp; And Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo; See to it that no one misleads you.<br />\n\tMatt. 24:5 &ldquo;For many will come in My name, saying, &lsquo;I am the Christ,&rsquo; and will mislead many.<br />\n\tMatt. 24:6 &ldquo;You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"End of Times Verses\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/ss-110329-libya-week-6-05_grid-8x2.jpg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 242px; float: right; margin: 10px 15px;\" />Jesus cautions us not to be misled, meaning we shouldn&#39;t be too quick to believe when someone declares that the end is near or that Jesus is about to return. Men have been declaring \"the end\" since the first century church.&nbsp; Paul himself was required to debunk rumors of the end in his letters to the church in Thessalonica. Jesus reassures us that these myths must arise yet they should be viewed critically.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, the world will experience wars and rumors (or threats) of wars, among other disruptive and disconcerting world events, but these events are not by themselves meaningful. These things must take place, according to the Lord, but they are not indicative of the end of the age. Jesus&#39; words compel us to be discerning students of the Bible, so that we will be prepared to recognize the true signs of the end without falling prey to deception in the meantime.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom this point, Jesus then proceeds to give the true signs of the end of the age and His imminent return:</p>\n<h5>\n\t<br />\n\tMatt. 24:7 &ldquo;For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes.<br />\n\tMatt. 24:8 &ldquo; But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tJesus says the first sign of the end will be an unique kind of war. Remember, Jesus warned earlier that routine war will not be a sign of His return, but when a new, unique type of warfare emerges, it <em>will</em> be a sign. When Jesus said \"nation against nation, kingdom against kingdom,\" He was using a common, ancient Jewish saying that meant \"the entire world at war.\" So, Jesus said when we see the entire world fighting in a war, the beginning of the end has come.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/ss-110329-libya-week-6-11_grid-7x2.jpg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 244px; margin: 10px 15px; float: left;\" />At the beginning of the twentieth century, our world experienced two such wars.&nbsp; World Wars I and II were the first wars in human history to involve countries from virtually every continent. In fact, we have named these events \"world wars\" because they were unprecedented conflicts.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext, Jesus warned the world will experience increases in famines and earthquakes. Jesus compared this trend to the way a woman experiences labor pains: they will increase in frequency and intensity as the end draws near.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven a casual observer of world events can notice the increasing rate and strength of both of these phenomenon. In fact, statistical records compiled by various geologic agencies confirm our suspicions: earthquakes have been increasing in frequency and strength over the past several decades.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/wreck.png\" style=\"width: 355px; height: 200px; margin: 10px 15px; float: right;\" />Jesus said the world would receive unmistakable signs that the end was near and that His return was imminent, but these signs would only be recognized by those who give attention to God&#39;s word and heed the signs. As believers who value God&#39;s word and endeavor to understand it, we may receive the blessing of recognizing these signs and preparing their hearts for the Lord&#39;s return. We may also be a blessing to others as we teach the truth concerning the coming day of Lord, and perhaps persuade some to accept the truth of the Gospel.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese chaotic times are reason for the world to worry, but they are reason for Christians to rejoice, as we anticipate the Kingdom&#39;s arrival on Earth. Verse By Verse Ministry remains committed to teaching Biblical truth so we may prepare believers for the Lord&#39;s return and draw unbelievers to Christ Jesus in this time of grace.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou can learn more about what the Bible has to say about the end the age and Jesus&#39; return in our verse-by-verse study through the <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation/\">Book of Revelation</a></strong>.</p>\n"

Recall, if you can, one of the opening scenes where spring has sprung and wise old owl describes the birds as &ldquo;twitter-pated&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve noticed that lately too. Between the fat spring raindrops, the birds are flying about in crazy aerobatics that can only be described as the dance of the twitter-pated. It&rsquo;s amazing, really, if you stop to watch the precision of two birds in flight at this time of year. They move with awe-inspiring velocity in loops and twirls, separated by mere inches, anticipating each other&rsquo;s course corrections with such speed that it is impossible to tell which one is leading and which one is following.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I make my way further and further through the book of Ephesians I can see Paul&rsquo;s hope for the church in the dance of the twitter-pated. Paul writes:<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit&mdash;just as you were called to one hope when you were called&mdash; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&rdquo; </em>Ephesians 4:3-6</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat would it look like if the Body &ndash; the Church &ndash; moved as if it were united by one Spirit and ceased striving against one another? What kind of spectacle would we create if we were in fact moving toward one hope through one faith? What if we became soaked with one baptism &ndash; marinated and dyed through-and- through until there was nothing to distinguish one from another? What if we collectively, simultaneously bent our knee to the one God and Father? It would look as if we were twitter-pated birds in a flight of unbridled joy to the praise of the One who created us. Selah.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook around your house of worship and consider the dance of spring. The Passover Lamb has been slain and new life is rising up declaring again the glory of the Lord. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fitting to renew your heart and allow it to be constrained by love so that you can join in the dance of the twitter-pated &ndash; that whirling, twirling, breathless flight of harmonious symphony that is the fellowship of the Body? I pray that He will breathe on you and that you will take flight!</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then he said to me, \"Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, &#39;This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe into these slain, that they may live.&#39;&#8202;\" </em>Ezekiel 37:9<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI have a fascination with boxes. I don&rsquo;t understand it, but I can&rsquo;t pass one without having to open it, even when I know that it&rsquo;s empty. I think it&rsquo;s actually the emptiness that appeals to me and all the ways that space could be filled. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I also love to look at empty houses, and&nbsp;day-dream about the possibilities for vacant retail spaces. I passed one today. It was a tidy little store-front in a quaint little mall that was just begging to be filled up with stuff and patronized by people who have been craving just that thing in just that space. I wondered what I would fill it up with.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I played out my little daydream, I know you&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s strange, but I even got excited by the idea of taking over a space that had been wrecked and left in shambles. There would be closets to clean out and shelves to move around and order that needed creating. I love that! While I was picturing myself standing in front of an illusionary junky closet, the Lord met me at the threshold. In a flash I saw my own junky closet and understood that I&rsquo;m like the box, the house, and the store. He wants to clean out the garbage, rearrange the furniture and create some order. He wants to fill me up with the good things that people are longing for. His creativity is boundless and who knows what will go in once all the junk is on the curb. I love that He loves that too &ndash; the excitement of creating order out of chaos and filling an empty space.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis isn&rsquo;t a new idea for you I&rsquo;m sure. It just struck me today in a kind of tender way. I don&rsquo;t often think of God in terms that are as tangible as my own feelings, but where do I think they come from? The same need for order and purpose that I feel is evident in all God does. He delights in having the freedom to make the most of His creation, without encumbrance, to His glory. Today, He just wanted me to know that and to apply the principle to myself. Now I&rsquo;m sharing it with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tGod has a divine purpose for you even if you don&rsquo;t know it yet. He can&rsquo;t walk past you without lifting the lid and imagining all the treasure He could hide away there. He can&rsquo;t look into the rooms of your life without imagining the new light fixtures and easy chairs. He can&rsquo;t pass your parking lot without the desire to fill it with people who&rsquo;ve come to enjoy what you have to offer. You are, I am, a daydream in the process of becoming a reality. A void being filled. Chaos being ordered. Purpose being reclaimed. But we have to remember that the box doesn&rsquo;t dictate what treasure it holds, whether a tidy cluster of paper-clips (be still my heart) or a rock collection. The house doesn&rsquo;t select its d&eacute;cor. The retail space doesn&rsquo;t demand to be a soda-fountain or a tire shop. They all simply hold the plans and dreams of their owner; expressing without resistance the purpose they were given.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt makes me smile to think that God gets the same flutter of excitement that I do over the thought of endless possibilities, but especially so when I think that it&rsquo;s me He&rsquo;s eyeing as His heart flutters. I want to be truly open (like a box), abandoned (like a house) and available (like space for rent) to whatever He&rsquo;s dreaming up for me so that His joy in creating will be evident in His creation. To His glory.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

By 1633, the name of that tepid biblical church had become a general term for any half-hearted or irresolute follower of a religious faith. Since then, the word&rsquo;s use has broadened to cover flimsy political devotion as well. For example, in comparing U.S. presidents, journalist Samuel Hopkins Adams compared \"the fiery and aggressive [Theodore] Roosevelt\" to \"the timorous Laodicean [Warren] Harding.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tHere is the passage that they reference:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>&#39;I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.&nbsp; So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth. (Revelation 3:15-16)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a common question that often arises from reading this passage: \"Does Messiah really want us to be hot (i.e. \"on fire\" for Him) or cold (i.e. completely uncaring and opposed to Him?)&nbsp; What happened to G-d desiring that none should perish but all should come to repentance?&nbsp; What happened to \"for G-d so loved the world\"?</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Why would G-d want us to be cold towards Him?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIf we study the history and geography of Laodicea we discover that there is more to the story than we might think...</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tHot and Cold Water</h2>\n<p>\n\tLaodicea was in the Lycus river valley near Colossae and Hierapolis.&nbsp; Unlike Laodicea, these two cities were both well known for their springs of water: cold at Colossae and hot at Hierapolis.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tColossae&#39;s water came from dozens of streams that were fed by melting snow on Mt. Cadmus that towered over the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; The snow remained on the mountain even into the middle of summer.&nbsp; Colossae was famous for cold, refreshing water.</p>\n<p>\n\tHierapolis&#39; water came from the white cliffs near the city that were warmed by volcanic activity beneath the area.&nbsp; Hierapolis was known for their enormous, hot, healing&nbsp;baths.&nbsp; People came from hundreds of miles around to find cure of their ailments in the hot baths of Hierapolis.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaodicea, on the other hand, had very poor water that was tepid and filled with minerals.&nbsp; The water pipes in the ruins of Laodicea still hold several inches of thick mineral deposits.&nbsp; Laodicea was, however, known for their three primary industries:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tthe incredibly soft, black wool of its sheep that was used to make luxury garments</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tits banking industry that provided a gold exchange</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tand a salve that was used for healing eye and ear problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThese three industries made Laodicea a very wealthy city.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is&nbsp;a story that tells of the great wealth of Laodicea.&nbsp; One time the entire town was destroyed by an earthquake and the emperor offered to rebuild the city.&nbsp; The citizens declined his offer because of their great wealth.&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We have no need of your aid because we are wealthy\", they said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>\n\tMessiah&#39;s Message</h2>\n<p>\n\tConsider the entire message given to the believers in Laodicea and how their industry and environment played a part in it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>\"To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God, says this: &#39;I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.&nbsp; So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth. Because you say, \"I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing,\" and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked, I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see. Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.&nbsp; Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.&nbsp; He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&#39;\"&nbsp; (Revelation 3:14-22)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is Messiah&nbsp;condemning?&nbsp;&nbsp;Their deeds!&nbsp; (verse 15)</p>\n<p>\n\tHe mentions that they are neither cold (and refreshing like the water in Colossae) or hot (and healing like the water in Hierapolis) but they are lukewarm (as was their water) so He will spit them out of His mouth.&nbsp; In this instance both hot and cold extremes are good.&nbsp; He is calling them to do good deeds born out of a&nbsp;heart overflowing with gratitude for the salvation and new life that He has purchased for them.&nbsp; What kinds of deeds?&nbsp; Perhaps the deeds He had mentioned earlier in His ministry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<em>&#39;For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you invited Me in; naked, and you clothed Me; I was sick, and you visited Me; I was in prison, and you came to Me.&#39;&nbsp; (Matthew 25:35-36)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tMessiah notes that they claim to be rich (and they were... by the world&#39;s standards) but they are poor (according to His standards).&nbsp; He says that they are miserable, poor, blind (although they have world-renown eye salve), and naked (although they have world-famous luxury clothing).</p>\n<p>\n\tHe tells them to buy gold <strong><em>from Him </em></strong>so that they may be rich.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe tells them to buy white garments<strong> <em>from Him </em></strong>so that they will no longer be naked.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe tells them to buy eye salve <strong><em>from Him </em></strong>so that they might see.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tHe uses those things for which they are well known to condemn and correct them.&nbsp; Most interestingly, He says that they should buy \"white garments\" from Him.&nbsp; Revelation 19:8 says that His bride is clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; \"for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints\".&nbsp; He condemns them for their \"lukewarm\" deeds and says they need the fine linen only He can offer them: the deeds that come from a new heart and a new life in Him.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tMay we not live like the Laodiceans but instead so live our lives that the world may see our good deeds and glorify our G-d and Savior (1 Peter 2:12).</p>\n<p>\n\tMay His name be praised!</p>\n<p>\n\t&lt;&gt;&lt;</p>\n"

I could preach a sermon on the scriptures God has been using to teach me what I&rsquo;m going to share with you, but for our purposes today just sit back and observe the humble beginnings of true freedom.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I get to my point, I will share with you, for the sake of context, some places God has had me camped out lately. If you look up these passages you may have the same response I had - weeping and gnashing of teeth. I have been from Revelation 2:5 to Ezra 3, especially verses 12 and 13, and I&rsquo;ve spent an agonizing time in Ezekiel 16 &ndash; all of it. I know at some point or another most Christians have read a passage of scripture and heard it in their head as if God were speaking the words audibly, inserting their name where appropriate. Ezekiel 16 was one of those places for me, and seriously, who just randomly chooses to study Revelation, Ezra, or Ezekiel in their daily quiet time? Not me, that&rsquo;s for certain. These scriptures were God appointed, and they stung. I don&rsquo;t want to be a prostitute! But that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve made of myself and that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s taken me a while to understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tI thought for some weeks that the take-away from these verses was that I&rsquo;ve been doing lots of good things for the kingdom but I&rsquo;ve been stealing God&rsquo;s glory through pride, and I needed to relearn the lesson of humility. I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn how to do all those things without pride but still do them. What I understand today is that what I&rsquo;ve been stealing from God is not just His glory. What I&rsquo;ve been stealing from God is me.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Message says in Galatians 5:5-6, &ldquo;&hellip;neither our most conscientious religion nor disregard of religion amounts to <strong>anything</strong>.&rdquo;(my emphasis). Well, that downright hurt my feelings. You mean I&rsquo;ve been doing all this &ldquo;religious&rdquo; work for nothing? Worse than nothing! It has made me an adulteress. I&rsquo;ve been so busy working to deserve God&rsquo;s&nbsp;love that I have forsaken Him entirely. I&rsquo;ve farmed myself out for hire by the gods of affirmation, approval, praise and a justifiable kind of love that tells me I&rsquo;m worth it.</p>\n<p>\n\tPicture with me prom night. OK, admittedly this speaks more to the ladies than the men, and maybe some of you didn&rsquo;t go to your prom or have wicked memories (and I do mean wicked, not like when our kids say it because it&rsquo;s cool) attached to the night&hellip;put all that aside for now and picture the idealized prom night. You&rsquo;ve bathed in perfumed soap, lotioned yourself to a dewy complexion, and have&nbsp;been to the hair stylist for the perfect up-sweep. Your mani and pedi are complete; your make-up is a work of art. The dress you chose floats around you like a dream and the rhinestones in your ears throw sparkles that dance around your face. Your breath catches in your throat as your date-charming (not a prince yet, but trying) catches his first glimpse of you, eyes as wide as the corsage in his hand. You are the picture of perfection. He is overcome with adoration. And rightly so. You have worked hard to create this picture of bliss and you deserve his undying affection. You&rsquo;re worth it.</p>\n<p>\n\tFast forward to the next day. Your hair is in flat lifeless strings. Your formerly dewy perfumed skin reeks of dance-floor sweat. The make-up previously so artfully done is now smeared by the pillow you fell on in the wee hours. One rhinestone is missing, the other is tangled in the shoulder strap of your dress, which is black and ripped at the hem from your date-not-so-charming&rsquo;s clumsy feet. You roll out of bed, pass a little gas from last night&rsquo;s over-indulgent dinner and rub the drool from your cheek. You toss the dress in a heap on the floor and climb into your favorite sweats &ndash; slightly worn. &ldquo;Do you love me now?&rdquo; That is the question we would ask of that prince, if he were one, and if we dared to let him see us as we truly are. Because this <strong>is</strong> who we truly are. God&rsquo;s answer &ndash; our Knight in Shining Armor&rsquo;s answer &ndash; yes. I love you now. I loved you then. I love you always and forevermore.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s unbearable. It&rsquo;s scandalous. It is my undoing. God loves us in spite of ourselves and all our religious machinations, but He will only tolerate our adulteress works for so long, because He is a jealous God. He is jealous for<strong> us</strong>. He is jealous for <strong>me</strong>. He wants it all. ALL. ALL. ALL of me. All the time. He doesn&rsquo;t want me parading around in my prom dress gathering names on my dance card. He wants His name on every line for every dance, tonight, tomorrow and the next day. He is not my prom date, He is my Husband. My One True Love. And He is not sharing me with anyone.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;ve been down this road in my head (and in my writing) more times than are worth counting but I&rsquo;m hoping this time to have my heart constrained by love. As I was mulling this over, trying to solidify it, I realized that there are people in my life who love me with Christ&rsquo;s love, and it was through that thought that I really understood. They know me. I make no pretense with them and they love me anyway. They love me because of the lack of pretense and effort. I don&rsquo;t get myself all slicked up before they see me because I am fully secure in their acceptance, and because of that, there is nothing I would not do for them as well. Love becomes the motivation for work, not to earn it, but in response to it because I&rsquo;m filled up with love, pressed down, shaken together and <strong>running over</strong>!</p>\n<p>\n\tI have not believed it possible, in spite of my sure salvation, that God could love me unless I was performing well (FOOLISH GALATIAN!). Bizarre, I know, but sometimes our head doesn&rsquo;t communicate with our heart and we think that working hard is the necessary route to love. But we forget that it isn&rsquo;t because we love Him that He loves us. He just does. For no discernable reason.</p>\n<p>\n\tI hope for your sake that all of this has been so much blah blah blah because you know what you know what you know. But if you&rsquo;re awfully busy about your religiosity trying to be deserving of God&rsquo;s&nbsp;love by getting all spiffed up and looking the part, maybe it&rsquo;s time to strip off that prom dress, put on those dirty sweatpants, do <strong>nothing,</strong>&nbsp;and ask the Lord, &ldquo;do you love me now?&rdquo; Guess what His answer is?<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>WARNING</strong>: This article contains very graphic language detailing what happens during an abortion. This is not for the faint of heart.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tIn January, 2011 a Philadelphia abortion doctor was arrested and charged with eight counts of murder. The district attorney said that the doctor &ldquo;induced labor, forced the live birth of viable babies in the sixth, seventh, eighth month of pregnancy and then killed those babies by cutting into the back of the neck with scissors and severing their spinal cord.&rdquo; The Philadelphia district attorney rightly accused this man of murder (assuming the allegations are true). My question is, why is it murder if the baby is outside the womb but not if the baby is inside the womb?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tLet me explain my position. Here is what actually happens in an abortion:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t&bull; &ldquo;Dr. Johnson had gotten the baby&rsquo;s body out by now and was searching for the head. This largest part of the baby&rsquo;s body is usually the last to come out. The head must be located and crushed before it can pass through the cervix. Usually it is first deflated &ndash; by suctioning out the brain and all the other contents.&rdquo; (<em>Blood Money</em>, by Carol Everett, page 11. Carol formerly ran an abortion clinic, but is now a Christian fighting against abortion)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t&bull; &ldquo;Dilation &amp; Extraction [a method of abortion] &mdash; Then an ultrasound device and forceps are used to reach in and grab the baby&rsquo;s feet. The little body is pulled downward until just the head remains in the cervix. Next the abortionist grasps the nape of the neck and cuts open the back of the skull with blunt scissors. A device called a cannula is then inserted into the wound and the brain material is sucked out. If kidneys or other organs are desired, they are removed while the child is still partially in the vagina. Initially at least, these surgical procedures are performed on a live baby who has not specifically been anesthetized (although the mother&rsquo;s medication may reduce some of the pain). (<em>Annihilating Abortion Arguments</em>, Hank Hanegraaff, Christian Research Institute apologetic)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tYes, I know this is gruesome, but it is actually what happens when a child is murdered while still in the womb. Do you see how similar this form of murder is to the Philadelphia doctor&rsquo;s method? Yet, this goes on every day in America, but, because of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision, <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, it&rsquo;s completely legal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tThe word of God tells us this type of cruelty comes about as a result of man&rsquo;s depravity. Romans 1:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\t&ldquo;<em>25For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. 26For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, 2<strong>9being filled with all unrighteousness</strong>, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, <strong>murder</strong>, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips, 30slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; <strong>32and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them</strong>.</em>&rdquo; (my emphasis added)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tThis is the result of exchanging the truth of God for a lie, for suppressing the truth in unrighteousness. Note that God tells us this results, in part, in murder (v. 29). Not only that, those who know that these things are wrong and that people who do such things are worthy of death, the depraved mind gives &ldquo;hearty approval to those who practice them&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s obvious we know these things are wrong, because we arrest people who do these things to babies outside the womb. But when it comes to the same action done inside the womb, the depraved mind actually approves! Does this not describe America (and every other country in which abortion is legal)?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tWhen people exchange God&rsquo;s truth and suppress it in unrighteousness, it should be no surprise that society becomes degenerate. Note that Romans 1 does not say that God punishes a nation for doing certain things (such as abortion/murder, or even homosexuality). Rather, God turns people over to a depraved mind when they do not acknowledge Him as God (v. 28). That is to say, these kinds of degenerate things happen <em>because</em> God is not acknowledged. God desires to be glorified, and He will not share His glory with another. He says plainly in Isaiah 42:8, &ldquo;<em>I am the LORD, that is My name; I will not give My glory to another, Nor My praise to graven images</em>.&rdquo; We are seeing this depravity writ large in the world on a daily basis, because the world does not acknowledge God as God.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">\n\tSo, what&rsquo;s a Christian to do? In America, God has given us a government that allows for our voices to be heard, so let&rsquo;s let our government leaders know that we want to see abortion made illegal. However, the most important thing we can do is pray. Pray that God would have mercy, and that He would bring a revival. Pray that God would make His church bold in preaching the gospel, that many would be saved. We cannot force people to change, nor can we legislate morality; indeed, people cannot even change their own hearts. Jeremiah 13:23 says it well, &ldquo;<em>Can the Ethiopian change his skin Or the leopard his spots? Then you also can do good Who are accustomed to doing evil</em>.&rdquo; The point being that those who are accustomed to doing evil cannot do good. Only a God given heart of flesh, a born again spirit, will want to see righteousness practiced. This is why we must preach the gospel. We can also rest in the assurance that, despite the degeneracy we witness and hear about on a daily basis, we know that this is not our home, we are just passing through. Any day now, the Lord Jesus will return, so let us all be ready. Even so, come Lord Jesus!<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tNormally I ignore the rubbish coming out of Hollywood that involves witches, goblins, ghosts, and vampires. That whole passage in Philippians comes to mind:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. (Philippians 4:8)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tGiven that neither Harry Potter nor the Twilight series seem to fit into any of those categories, I haven&rsquo;t paid them much mind beyond being generally aware that they are a &ldquo;big deal&rdquo; to the American public. Imagine my surprise when I read an article on Foxnews.com entitled &ldquo;Vampire Books Like &lsquo;Twilight&rsquo; May be Altering Teen Minds&ldquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Surprise?&rdquo;, you may ask.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;What surprise is there about those types of books &lsquo;altering teen minds&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tAllow me to share a few bits from the article:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;<em>We don&rsquo;t know exactly how literature affects the brain, but we know that it does,&rdquo; said Maria Nikolajeva, a Cambridge University professor of literature. &ldquo;Some new findings have identified spots in the brain that respond to literature and art.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis, in and of itself, is not surprising. After all, Scripture tells us to &ldquo;study to show yourself approved&rdquo; (2 Timothy 2:15) and such study involves reading. The work of the Holy Spirit on top of the simple act of reading Scripture is an unmatched &ldquo;turbo boost&rdquo; at changing our brains. Paul makes a point along this line of thought in Romans 12:2&hellip;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAh. I see you are still here, patiently waiting for the &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; part. Well, here goes&hellip;</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Scientists, authors and educators met in Cambridge, England, Sept. 3-5 for a conference organized by Nikolajeva to discuss how young-adult books and movies affect teenagers&rsquo; minds.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Attendees at the conference included experts in neuroscience, psychology, art, literature and music, as well as writers such as Meg Rosoff, author of &ldquo;How I Live Now&rdquo; and other teen titles. While teens might be turning the pages of &ldquo;Twilight&rdquo; for the plot and romance, other takeaways from the books may be having a lasting impact, too.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The series follows Bella, a teenage girl who falls in love with a much older vampire named Edward. Some critics have argued that Bella&rsquo;s passivity, and the story&rsquo;s abstinence-until-marriage message, are anti-feminist.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;If you look very, very clearly at what kind of values the &lsquo;Twilight&rsquo; books propagate, these are very conservative values that do not in any way endorse independent thinking or personal development or a woman&rsquo;s position as an independent creature,&rdquo; Nikolajeva said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite depressing.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\tExcuse me? Did I get that right?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThese folks are upset because the characters in this moral vampire story are, ahem, too conservative?</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Moral vampires&rdquo; apparently are unacceptable on the vampire scene at Cambridge where the professor lives. It appears that what Ms. Nikolajeva is looking for are completely depraved vampires, er, I mean &ldquo;independent creatures&rdquo;. Is she serious?</p>\n<p>\n\tOh, but wait&hellip; there&rsquo;s more&hellip;</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Nikolajeva argued that authors have a moral responsibility to include some positivity and hope in works aimed at teens.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAre you kidding me? Does anybody but me recognize the painful irony of her statement?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe professor over there is upset because the fictional characters in this fictional story about fictional moral vampires have positive, conservative morals (specifically abstinence until marriage) and yet she says the authors have a moral responsibility to &ldquo;include some positivity and hope&rdquo; in their works?</p>\n<p>\n\tReally?</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough we might be tempted to laugh and ignore the absurdity of this situation, this is the type of moral relativism that exists in our world. We must prepare ourselves and especially prepare our children to defend against it. One particular passage of Scripture comes to mind in this situation. I would hazard a guess that the professor is unfamiliar with it:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! (Isaiah 5:20)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a consequence associated with taking a position of calling good evil and evil good. I for one do not want to find out first-hand what that particular woe is.</p>\n<p>\n\tRevelation 22:20 says this: &lsquo; He who testifies to these things says, &ldquo;Yes, I am coming quickly.&rdquo; Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. &lsquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, come quickly, Lord, and put an end to all of this nonsense. Please.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tMy husband is a giant among men. He really deserves more credit than he gets for being married to me for going-on-22 years. Let me explain. We have a teenaged son. If you have one of these then you know what our schedule is like without me having to explain. Tuesday nights are a doozy. We run home from school to meet the math tutor. I throw dinner together while they meet, and Wil and I choke it down before the trumpet teacher arrives. Once the music begins I&rsquo;m dashing out the door to lead Bible study. Somewhere in that melee my husband arrives home. I usually shout instructions at him over my shoulder about what&rsquo;s for dinner and where it is (oven or refrigerator) as I wind-kiss him goodbye. The poor guy.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn a recent Tuesday, we went through the typical drill, except that my husband was obviously a little pre-occupied. Since he had decided to take a run before eating dinner I shoved his crisp Mexican chicken salad into the fridge and left the quesadillas by the stove to be warmed up when he was ready, and then I dashed out the door. When I got home and went to the fridge for a snack, there sat his lovely green salad still tightly wrapped and looking as inviting as ever.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t eat your salad!&rdquo; I exclaimed.<br />\n\tCompletely chagrined, my husband turned to me slowly and said, &ldquo;I forgot&rdquo;.<br />\n\t&ldquo;What did you eat?&rdquo; I demanded.<br />\n\t&ldquo;Those&hellip;quesadillas&hellip;?&rdquo; He asked as if looking for my approval.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow you must understand that the &ldquo;quesadillas&rdquo; were nothing more than a pile of cheese melted between two plain old tortilla wraps. And there were four little triangles left &ndash; meant to a<em>ccompany</em> his salad, not to be the main course &ndash; but he was grateful for them. This should tell you something about what he&rsquo;s come to expect at dinner time, which is why I nominate him for the husband-of-the-year award, but my point is this: when was the last time you were grateful for a big ol&rsquo; plate full o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;?<br />\n\tOuch.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the course our Christian lives have taken, we have learned to pray for all our needs&hellip;and then some. Paul says that we are to present our requests to God, and we&rsquo;ve gotten really good at that, but we&rsquo;re not so good at accepting the answer when it winds up being a big ol&rsquo; plate full o&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;. I think my husband is the model of gratitude, not because he&rsquo;s come to expect so little, but because he was simply content with what was provided to him &ndash; grateful that it was waiting and that it satisfied his need. How simple. How remarkable. How wonderful.&nbsp;</p>\n"

It has not been completely without light, but it has definitely been heavy and dim. I don&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;ve been depressed, but rather that my spiritual clarity has been shrouded in cloud cover. And where there is darkness, God is not there.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don&rsquo;t know if you ever experience this, but I&rsquo;ve had what old timers would call a &ldquo;come to Jesus meeting&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s been taking me to task over some things that I heard Him say last year about grace and works, but somehow didn&rsquo;t fully apprehend. (Pride goeth before destruction and all that.) Now I find myself on my face in the school of God, pleading for mercy and further instruction. I&rsquo;ve lost my way. I&rsquo;ve stumbled in darkness. I&rsquo;ve been walking and talking through a mist of confusion. I need a light to shine on my feet so that I can see the ancient path, but somehow, this time I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be as easy as flipping a switch.</p>\n<p>\n\tI was standing in my kitchen just a few minutes ago and began to notice a brightness lift the snow-day gloom around me. You know how it is when the cloud-cover thins out just a bit, and though the sun isn&rsquo;t fully revealed, the air becomes lighter, reminding you that above the clouds is radiance, and warmth, and a healing balm of life to the soul. It made me realize that this too is true of my spiritual condition. I&rsquo;m beginning to see some light. Things are not fully revealed, and I don&rsquo;t have total clarity, but the darkness is lifting.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the hardest thing about winter is waiting for spring. In months of death and dormancy and darkness, I long for the fragrance of renewed earth and growth and life. I am tantalized by the thought of fruit hidden behind blooms hidden behind seemingly lifeless branches bare of splendor. I know all those things are there, concealed from sight, waiting for light to call them to life again, but it&rsquo;s the waiting that gets me. And it is waiting in the gloom of a spiritual winter that is hard for all of us when we experience it. I know the full illumination of the&nbsp;Light of the World is just beyond my gaze right now because I have much hard-hearted ground to plow. There are some things in my life that have to die, or be frozen into dormancy. I have some rest coming too; rest from works that lead to death&hellip;have led to death. There is work to be done in this winter season but I know that light is coming. Life is coming.</p>\n<p>\n\tI hope that this finds you spiritually in the full bloom of spring despite the weather outside, but if you too find yourself in the grey days, take heart. Have hope. Do the work that this season allows. Warmer days are just ahead and when they come, bear the fruit this season allowed you to store up within you and praise God for the Light of the world.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI guess I need to just be still long enough for the Lord to speak to me in the way He does when I know it&rsquo;s for sharing. Like today. I made applesauce this morning. There is nothing better than from-the-tree applesauce tucked away in your freezer for a cold December day. This year was especially exciting since it was the first harvest from our own trees &ndash; supplemented by my neighbors&rsquo; windfalls.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don&rsquo;t know if you have ever made applesauce, but it is a labor of love. And I do mean labor. Apples from the tree are not supermarket apples. What you get from your common backyard apple tree are wormy apples, bruised apples, apples that have been sampled and passed over, and knobby, crooked apples. That means that even with a chopper/peeler/corer there is still a lot of work to be done to make the apples pot-ready. Bad spots have to be trimmed off. Fruit that don&rsquo;t go through the machine straight has to have the core trimmed out a bit. Sometimes the peel at the top and bottom get overlooked by the peeler and that has to go too (mostly because I don&rsquo;t like it in my sauce and I HATE having to deal with it in the ricer). And then there&rsquo;s the mess. Bags of peels (I don&rsquo;t make jelly) and cores and trimmings leaking apple juice all over everything in sight making a sticky mess on the counters, the sink, and the floor.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of these practical inconveniences were making me grumble a bit today because I have a ton of stuff to do and didn&rsquo;t really have time to be making applesauce. But fruit waits for no man. So, it wasn&rsquo;t until I got the apples peeled, potted, cooked down, and riced (is that a word) that I began to get the picture. See, after you&rsquo;ve worked the apples into a sauce, you have to sample a bit to know how much sugar to add, and I could not get enough sugar into this sauce! It just would not sweeten up. That&rsquo;s when it hit me that the applesauce was too much like me.</p>\n<p>\n\tPraise the Lord in heaven that He has already dealt with the worms, the bruises, the wobbles and the pits and has mashed me down into this new creation, which he assures me I have become&hellip;still an apple, just different&hellip;but now the work begins to sweeten and season and enhance. In my applesauce I&rsquo;ve added red-hots along with copious amounts of sugar and cinnamon and I&rsquo;ve left it to absorb those flavors for a while. When I go back, I expect the taste to be different-to be sweeter. It&rsquo;s the same with me. This new creation I&rsquo;ve become would be fine, I suppose, if nothing else was added, but how much better could I be if I soaked in the Word, stewed in His flavor and let myself become saturated with Him through and through.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;m hoping for the best with my sauce because it was a ton of work, and I do love the taste so much when it&rsquo;s just right. I know the Lord is hoping for the same thing from me. So much goes into the process on His part and there&rsquo;s so little required on my part that it seems a small thing to rest and absorb His sweet Spirit. I will take time to do that today and hopefully tomorrow you will taste and see that the Lord is good. Before I can do that, though, I&rsquo;ve got to go deal with all the garbage piled up and leaking all over my kitchen. &nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tIf a stranger walked up to you and asked you the question, \"Who will go to Heaven?\" Would you be able to give him an answer for the hope that lies within you? Would you know how to share the gospel? Do you know on what basis we are saved? The answer is something every Christian should know.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Barna Research from 2007, here are some interesting statistics regarding what people believe about how a person gets to heaven:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&bull; More than half of all adults (53%) believe that if a person is generally good, or does enough good things for others during their life, they will earn a place in Heaven.<br />\n\t&bull; 37% of born agains believe that if a person is good enough they can earn a place in Heaven.<br />\n\t&bull; 26% of born agains agree that \"while he lived on earth, Jesus committed sins, like other people,\" compared to 41% of all adults.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tNote that the first group listed covers Americans in general, and the results are not surprising. The last two statistics cover Americans who have identified themselves as a born again Christian. (By the way, as R.C. Sproul has pointed out, to call oneself a \"born again\" Christian is redundant - that&#39;s the only kind of Christian there is!) The results for this group are disturbing. Given that over one third of American Christians think good works get you to heaven, I thought it would be good to review what Scripture says about how one gets to heaven. While it&#39;s likely that for the readers of this newsletter this amounts to a review, it certainly never hurts for us to be reminded of this truth.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe simple answer to this question is given in Acts 16:31, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.\" However, when sharing the gospel, it&#39;s useful to be able to tell people why they need to believe in Jesus, because most people (if any) will not walk up to you and ask you how to be saved. There are several ways this can be done, but one I&#39;ve found very helpful involves first giving someone the Law, and then the gospel. Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron, in their ministry The Way of the Master, have been great proponents of this method. It&#39;s very simple and direct.</p>\n<p>\n\tGetting the conversation started is usually the hardest part. One way to bring up the subject is to ask someone if they think they will go to heaven when they die. Most people will say they are good persons, and will likely go to heaven. This is where you take them to the Law, the Ten Commandments in particular. You only need to ask them if they&#39;ve followed two to three of the commandments, which, if they&#39;re honest, they&#39;ll admit that they have broken these commandments.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&#39;s helpful to say you, too, have broken these commandments so as not to appear self-righteous. Remind them that to go to heaven, God requires sinlessness. Once they have convicted themselves, ask if they think whether God will send them to heaven or hell. Many times they will bring up God&#39;s forgiveness, but without a full understanding on what His forgiveness is based. Make sure they understand that God is a just judge, and that it is His nature that He must punish sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow that they know the bad news, tell them the good news. This is where you give them the gospel. Tell them God will indeed forgive them, but only if they place their faith in Jesus Christ. Let them know that Jesus did two things for them. First, on the cross, He took the punishment for their and your sin. Thus, God remains a just judge in that He punished our sin. Second, Jesus&#39; perfect righteousness is imputed (or credited), by faith, to us. Therefore, God&#39;s requirement of perfection is met in us by Christ&#39;s sinless life. In that sense, we are saved by good works, but not our own. We are saved by Christ&#39;s good works, His perfect, sinless life. In this sense, we rejoice with Jeremiah, proclaiming \"The LORD our righteousness.\"&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge (Rom 10:2)</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tIn September, the Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life released the results of their &ldquo;U.S. Religious Knowledge Survey.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tThe results were summarized in a FoxNews.com article that stated:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Atheists and agnostics scored highest, with an average of 21 correct answers [out of 32 questions], while Jews and Mormons followed with about 20 accurate responses. Protestants overall averaged 16 correct answers, while Catholics followed with a score of about 15.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Hispanic Catholics were the lowest scoring group with 11.6 questions answered correctly. </em></p>\n<p>\n\tFox News also reported:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The U.S. is one of the most religious countries in the developed world, especially compared to largely secular Western Europe, but faith leaders and educators have long lamented that Americans still know relatively little about religion.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough many might disagree, the proof in the Pew study is a stark reminder of the lack of interest among most Christians to understand what they claim to believe. This truth was pointedly condensed into 140 characters or less via Twitter:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>To most Christians, the Bible is like a software license. Nobody actually reads it. They just scroll to the bottom and click &ldquo;I agree&rdquo;.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis is an unfortunate truth.&nbsp;Does this mean that every believer should pursue a PhD in Theology?&nbsp;By no means!&nbsp;It does mean that believers need to understand Scripture better. Through such understanding we can come to know and love our Lord and Savior better.&nbsp;Peter uses the phrase &ldquo;Lord and Savior&rdquo; repeatedly in Scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tI believe he had it in the proper order: Lord and Savior.&nbsp;Most who would profess belief in the Messiah Yeshua (Christ Jesus) seem to have no problem with Him as their Savior. They are thankful and grateful for being saved from the consequence of their sins.&nbsp;However, this same group has (by all appearances) a major problem with Christ as their Lord. Sadly, this is not a new problem.&nbsp;The apostle Paul dealt with this same issue in the first century as he said:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase? May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it? (Romans 6:1)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHere Paul was dealing with believers who thought it was OK to continue sinning. Their thinking appears to be &ldquo;Hey, why not keep on sinning? After all, we&rsquo;re were already saved!&rdquo; Paul squashes such thoughts as unScriptural and unacceptable.</p>\n<p>\n\tChrist told the man who had been ill for thirty-eight years:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>&ldquo;Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.&rdquo; (John 5:14)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHe told the woman who was caught in adultery:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>&ldquo;From now on sin no more.&rdquo; (John 8:11)</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps we should heed the words of our Lord.&nbsp;Believers should become increasingly mature in honoring Messiah not only as their Savior but as their Lord. This maturity is reflected in our actively and intentionally turning away from sin and turning towards the deeds He would have us do.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul exhorted the believers in Ephesus.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need. Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. (Ephesians 4:28-32)</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tPaul admonished the believers in Corinth:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>Become sober-minded as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame. (1 Corinthians 15:34)</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tWorks are never required for us to earn or keep salvation. &ldquo;Good works&rdquo; are, however, the spiritual consequence of being saved.&nbsp;Paul tells the Ephesians:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. (Ephesians 2:10, emphasis added)</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tFor each of us, the life we live before and life we live after we are saved should be vastly different.&nbsp;Do you know what G-d expects of you now that He has called you to be part of His kingdom? Turn away from sin. Do what is right in the eyes of G-d. Live a life that reflects your relationship with G-d.&nbsp;He alone is the Savior.&nbsp;He alone is the Lord.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>&ldquo;You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of unprincipled men and fall from your own steadfastness, but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.&rdquo; (2 Peter 3:17-18)<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n"

In the course of our exchange, Sally described her emotionally painful reaction to learning of God&#39;s soveriegnty in salvation, so we tried to offer her some perspective from Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Part 2 of our converations follows below:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><strong>Sally:</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Thank you for your <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/wrestling_with_god/\"><strong>response</strong></a>.&nbsp; Honestly, your email did not help me at all.&nbsp; It has hurt me!&nbsp; To think that God didn&#39;t choose me or anyone in my family, or anyone in the world for that matter truly hurts!!&nbsp; God knew before He created the world that Adam would disobey. and God knew how this world would turn out yet He still chose to create us knowing He was going to send the unfortunate to hell!!!&nbsp; How is that even fair?&nbsp; How is God a loving God if He sends people to hell, when He decided not to have mercy on them??</p>\n\n<p>I always thought that GOD wanted us to come to Him and to truly love Him and to want to worship Him. If He is picking who gets saved, is God truly being loved and worshiped? Why did Jesus have to come to earth then, if God already decided who would be saved and who wouldn&#39;t, and&nbsp; how do I know my prayers are being heard?&nbsp; If I haven&#39;t been chosen then I am essentially wasting my time going to church, and trying to learn more about God.&nbsp; I always thought God had mercy on everyone and that He loved all of us! (everyone on this earth).</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t like the feelings and thoughts that I am having.&nbsp; I don&#39;t want to be rejected by God and I want God in my life and I was happy knowing or at least thinking that anyone could be saved, but now I&#39;m just sad.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><strong>VBVM</strong>:<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>You are not alone in your negative response.&nbsp; Every Christian we know has experienced this&nbsp;same struggle to accept the truth of election when they first came to know of God&#39;s sovereignty in salvation. Even Jesus&#39; disciples struggled with the concept when He taught this truth in John 6:</p>\n\n<h5>John 6:58 &ldquo;This is the bread which&nbsp; came down out of heaven; not as&nbsp; the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread&nbsp; will live forever.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 6:59 These things He said&nbsp; in the synagogue as He taught&nbsp; in Capernaum.<br />\nJohn 6:60&nbsp; Therefore many of His&nbsp; disciples, when they heard this said, &ldquo; This is a difficult statement; who can listen to it?&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 6:61 But Jesus,&nbsp; conscious that His disciples grumbled at this, said to them, &ldquo;Does this&nbsp; cause you to stumble?<br />\nJohn 6:62 &ldquo;What then if you see&nbsp; the Son of Man&nbsp; ascending to where He was before?<br />\nJohn 6:63 &ldquo; It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing;&nbsp; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.<br />\nJohn 6:64 &ldquo;But there are&nbsp; some of you who do not believe.&rdquo; For Jesus&nbsp; knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and&nbsp; who it was that would&nbsp; betray Him.<br />\nJohn 6:65 And He was saying, &ldquo;For this reason I have&nbsp; said to you, that no one can come to Me unless&nbsp; it has been granted him from the Father.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 6:66&nbsp; As a result of this many of His&nbsp; disciples&nbsp; withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Did you notice in vs.65-66 when Jesus stated that God elects Christ&#39;s followers (i.e., \"no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father...\") that then many disciples began to withdraw from Jesus? Obviously, this truth has always been a difficult thing to accept, so we are in good company.</p>\n\n<p>As the truths of God&#39;s purposes in salvation and His sovereignty over His Creation come into conflict with our preconceived notions and flawed human understanding, the effect will be uncomfortable and disorienting. We will fight to maintain our point of view, and we will search for the flaw in what we&#39;re hearing and reading in Scripture. &nbsp;We may say to ourselves, \"It CAN&#39;T be true.\" Still, we must remember that our feelings and our assumptions will lie to us, but Scripture is truth.</p>\n\n<p>Objective truth is not determined by our feelings, so even though we may feel uncomfortable or unhappy about something we learn in God&#39;s word, that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t true.&nbsp;For example, when we learn that a loved one has died, we may experience intense anguish at hearing the news, and our strong feelings may even lead us to deny the truth of the person&#39;s passing. Nevertheless, we must eventually acknowledge the reality despite our initial negative reaction.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, our initial response to the truth of election may be negative (simply because the doctrine will challenge long-held assumptions concerning aalvation and God), nevertheless we cannot reject the truthfulness of what we read in the Bible because of how it makes us feel. The truth of God&#39;s word often makes us uncomfortable, and this is as it <em>should</em> be.</p>\n\n<p>God&#39;s ways are not our ways, the Bible tells us, and so we shouldn&#39;t be surprised when we discover God works in ways that are different from what we assumed.&nbsp;God&#39;s word is intended to disrupt our blissful ignorance, so that after our false views are torn down, the Spirit can begin to refashion us into disciples who have the mind of Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can see now why many well-intentioned (but mistaken) pastors have shied away from teaching this doctrine. They don&#39;t want to offend their congregations, and they know if they teach election as the Bible presents it, they will receive many difficult questions &ndash; and perhaps some church members will leave to seek a teacher who will tickle their ears.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Church is supposed to understand these things and teach them to one another so that we will mature in our understanding of God and His plan. We encourage you to allow time for God to answer your objections and give you peace concerning His plan rather than rejecting it out of hand on the basis of your feelings. We can assure you that - in time - God&#39;s Spirit will explain the truth of these things and will give you understanding and comfort. &nbsp;We pray you won&#39;t be as one of those disciples who walked away from the Living God rather than accepting the truth of His word.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we wanted to respond directly to a few comments in your second letter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, you questioned how it could be \"fair\" that God would create a world in which He knew men would go to Hell, and the Bible answers that question. (Keep in mind that if God were truly \"fair\" to everyone, He would send all sinners to Hell without exception, so we should think twice about demanding that God be \"fair.\") &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Remember that God made all things in Creation for His glory. He designed all Creation and Man in particular so that we would have the capacity to fully appreciate Him and glorify His name and God&#39;s plan of election ensures that God receives the most glory from His creation for Who He is.</p>\n\n<p>If the world never knew judgment for sin, then Man could never know or appreciate God&#39;s perfect justice, judgment, wrath, mercy and grace. These attributes of God can only be understood and appreciated in a world that contains both saved and unsaved, sinners and saints. As God judges sinners and saves believers, the creation witnesses a contrast that allows it to appreciate both sides of God&#39;s character and thereby give Him glory for all aspects of Who He is.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, Paul anticipated that the truth of election would lead us to question God&#39;s fairness in choosing to save some but not everyone, so Paul addressed the question directly in Romans:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 9:19&nbsp;&nbsp; You will say to me then, &ldquo; Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul says we might ask why does God still find fault (i.e., condem some to judgment for their sin) since no one can resist God&#39;s will? In other words, why does God hold some people accountable for their sin when He has the power to elect everyone to saving faith? Like you, Paul asks why doesn&#39;t God save everyone from Hell? Paul knew that this question would be on our minds, so he answers by saying:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 9:20 On the contrary, who are you,&nbsp; O man, who&nbsp; answers back to God?&nbsp; The thing molded will not say to the molder, &ldquo;Why did you make me like this,&rdquo; will it?<br />\nRom. 9:21 Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel&nbsp; for honorable use and another&nbsp; for common use?<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul says we have no right to demand God explain Himself or satisfy our objections on the question of His mercy. Paul says we are answering back (i.e., blaspheming&nbsp;God) when we ask this question because we are impugning His holy and good character and implying His plan wasn&#39;t right.&nbsp; Paul asks rhetorically doesn&#39;t the God of Creation have a right to do whatever He pleases with His Creation? The obvious answer is yes. Paul ridicules our thinking by asking can the thing that is created (i.e., the clay pot) judge its Creator, God? The answer, of course, is we are in no position to judge Him.</p>\n\n<p>In His omniscience and wisdom, God created some people for honor (i.e., some \"pots\" are destined for glory) and others He destined for dishonor, and this is the Creator&#39;s sovereign right. He doesn&#39;t owe us anything, including an explanation, yet He has graciously provided us with His word so that we might understand the way God works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, He has chosen to save the elect even though all men are sinful and none deserve His mercy. The fact that a holy and just God chose to show mercy to some sinners (like us) doesn&#39;t mean He is obligated to show mercy to everyone. God is no less holy because He choose to show mercy to only some, as Paul said concerning Pharaoh:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 9:17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &ldquo; FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED&nbsp; THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.&rdquo;<br />\nRom. 9:18 So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He&nbsp; hardens whom He desires.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>To your question of why Jesus came to die, our faith must have an object, and the object of our faith is the propitiation of Christ. Christ&#39;s coming to Earth was necessary because there must be an atonement for sin, but then&nbsp;God brings faith to a person so that they will accept Christ and His work on the cross. Christ&#39;s atonement was sufficient to save all men from sin, but it only rests upon those whom the Father causes to believe in it. &nbsp;As Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>John 6:37 &ldquo; All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out.<br />\nJohn 6:38 &ldquo;For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but&nbsp; the will of Him who sent Me.<br />\nJohn 6:39 &ldquo;This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of&nbsp; all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but&nbsp; raise it up on the last day.<br />\nJohn 6:40 &ldquo;For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who&nbsp; beholds the Son and&nbsp; believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Thirdly, we can assure you that your prayers are being heard by God.&nbsp; As Scripture teaches:</p>\n\n<h5>Prov. 15:29 The LORD is far from the wicked,<br />\nBut He hears the prayer of the righteous.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>God always hears the prayers of His children. In fact, you can be sure He hears you because you are His by faith. Again, the doctrine of election does not mean God is uncaring or uninvolved in our lives. On the contrary, He is living in us by His Spirit!</p>\n\n<p>By the way, we have an extended teaching, entitled <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_sovereignty_of_god/purpose_in_prayer/\"><strong>The Purpose in Prayer</strong></a>, that explains how God works through our prayers in light of His sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, why are we called to attend church (or do any other good work of the faith)? We are called to go to church and grow in our faith so that we may please the Father and receive an eternal reward at our judgment moment. Although faith saved us from the judgment for our sin, nevertheless believers still experience a judgment moment after our death. The judgment for believers is a judgment to evaluate our good works, and it is for the purpose of assigning eternal reward.</p>\n\n<p>Paul taught concerning the judgment moment for believers in 2Cor 5:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 5:9 Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him.<br />\n2Cor. 5:10 For we must all appear before&nbsp; the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>We must all give an account to Christ concerning how we lived while in this body.&nbsp; Paul also teaches that this judgment will be a process of acknowledging our good works while discounting any selfish, unholy works. Paul used a metaphor of a building to represent our life&#39;s achievement of good works.&nbsp; Some believers will build something lasting and worthwhile while other Christians will waste their lives on earth building useless and temporary things.&nbsp; As Paul explained:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:10&nbsp; According to&nbsp; the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder&nbsp; I laid a foundation, and&nbsp; another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.<br />\n1Cor. 3:11 For no man can lay a&nbsp; foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br />\n1Cor. 3:12 Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver,&nbsp; precious stones, wood, hay, straw,<br />\n1Cor. 3:13&nbsp; each man&rsquo;s work will become evident; for&nbsp; the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test&nbsp; the quality of each man&rsquo;s work.<br />\n1Cor. 3:14 If any man&rsquo;s work which he has built on it remains, he will&nbsp; receive a reward.<br />\n1Cor. 3:15 If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet&nbsp; so as through fire.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice that even if a Christian builds nothing of value in their life, they are still saved, because their salvation came by faith alone and not by their works. Their faith made possible a life of works to please the Father. An obedient believer may earn great reward in Heaven, while the disobedient believer will receive little or no eternal inheritance in the kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>This is why we share the Gospel with unbelievers and go to church and study the Bible and seek to serve in many ways. We wish to have a good testimony when we stand before the Lord. When we do good works like sharing the Gospel and teaching the Bible and caring for the brethren and supporting Christian ministries, etc., we are acting obediently to our Master&#39;s call and pleasing Him by our faithfulness.</p>\n\n<p>You were not saved for your own sake; God chose to save you so that you might glorify Him by your good works. As Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 5:16 &ldquo;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may&nbsp; see your good works, and&nbsp; glorify your Father who is in heaven.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Finally, we cannot stress enough how valuable our <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_book_of_romans/\">Romans study</a></strong> would be for you.&nbsp; We can assure you that this study will address most if not all of your questions and help you come to grips with this Biblical truth.&nbsp; God has given us the book of Romans for this very reason: so that we could understand and appreciate His plan of salvation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Please trust us when we say that this study will bring you to an appreciation for how God&#39;s plan of salvation is a reflection of His goodness rather than an indictment of His character. Even Paul himself was overwhelmed with admiration for God once He grasped the wisdom of God&#39;s plan, as he wrote in Romans:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 11:33 &nbsp;Oh, the depth of&nbsp; the riches&nbsp; both of the&nbsp; wisdom and knowledge of God!&nbsp; How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!<br />\nRom. 11:34 For&nbsp; WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR?<br />\nRom. 11:35 Or&nbsp; WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM&nbsp; THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN?<br />\nFor&nbsp; from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.&nbsp; To Him be the glory&nbsp; forever. Amen.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5><br />\n<strong>Sally:</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Thank you for your response!&nbsp; After crying, being mad and praying, I eventually came to the realization that it is what it is.&nbsp; It is God&#39;s will.&nbsp; No matter how torn up I am inside or angry I am, nothing will change.&nbsp; I still don&#39;t fully understand, but I will read through Romans and I will listen to your recordings. I will never walk away from God! &nbsp;Of course I still have questions but I will talk to my pastor and see what he says.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t<em>Cargo cult:</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>A <strong>cargo cult </strong>is a religious practice that has appeared in many traditional tribal societies in the wake of interaction with technologically advanced cultures. The cults focus on obtaining the material wealth (the &ldquo;cargo&rdquo;) of the advanced culture through magic and religious rituals and practices. Cult members believe that the wealth was intended for them by their deities and ancestors. Cargo cults developed primarily in remote parts of New Guinea and other Melanesian and Micronesian societies in the southwest Pacific Ocean, beginning with the first significant arrivals of Westerners in the 19th century. Similar behaviors have, however, also appeared elsewhere in the world.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Cargo cult activity in the Pacific region increased significantly during and immediately after World War II, when the residents of these regions observed the Japanese and American combatants bringing in large amounts of material. When the war ended, the military bases closed and the flow of goods and materials ceased. In an attempt to attract further deliveries of goods, followers of the cults engaged in ritualistic practices such as building crude imitation landing strips, aircraft and radio equipment, and mimicking the behaviour that they had observed of the military personnel operating them.</em>&nbsp;<em>[Source: Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult].</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tMany believers in Messiah have this &ldquo;cargo cult&rdquo; mentality. They see the blessing that G-d has poured out on His chosen people, Israel, and think, &ldquo;If I do what the Jews are doing then I will also receive the blessing which they are receiving!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"Cargo Cult\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/signals.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; float: right; width: 425px; height: 237px;\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tConsider the signals shown in the graphic to the right. The Landing Signals Officer performs these movements in order to assist aircraft landings. After the aircraft lands there are &ldquo;blessings&rdquo; (food, goods, and materials) that come forth from the aircraft. Someone who was unaware of the truth might think that these movements cause the blessings to occur. &ldquo;If I make these movements then the blessings come&rdquo;, or so their thinking goes.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose with the &ldquo;cargo cult&rdquo; mentality are unaware of two things:</p>\n<p>\n\t1. The existing relationship between the person at headquarters who sends the food, goods, and materials and the person performing these signals.&nbsp;<br />\n\t2. The choice of the person at headquarters to send it.</p>\n<p>\n\tG-d has an existing relationship with Israel. He chose her as a bride from among every tribe, people, nation, and tongue (Deuteronomy 10:15). If we as gentiles are part of Israel (grafted in as Paul puts it in Romans 11) then we can participate in that existing relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tG-d also chooses who He will bless and when.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>For He says to Moses, &ldquo;I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.&rdquo; [quoting Exodus 33:19] So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy. (Romans 9:15-16)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tG-d is not required to bless us if we &ldquo;wave our arms a certain way&rdquo;. He is soveriegn and will bless whomever He chooses.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe should respond to G-d&rsquo;s commandments as part of the Commonwealth of Israel (Ephesians 2:11-13), because we have that relationship not because we expect G-d&rsquo;s blessing as a result&hellip;and not because we are acting like a cargo cult.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9)</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tNow to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

I don&rsquo;t mean a verbal altercation; I mean a down and dirty, roll-in-the-dirt fist fight?</p>\n\n<p>I was eight, and I can&rsquo;t remember the reason, but I remember the boy&rsquo;s name and how it was over before it really got started. I took the initiative and belted my opponent right in the gut. He went down on his fanny with a look on his face that I will never forget. Victory! Sweet victory!</p>\n\n<p>(I know at this point you&rsquo;re looking back at my profile picture thinking that someone posted this to the wrong person&rsquo;s link &ndash; but no, they got it right.)</p>\n\n<p>Now I&rsquo;m not advocating playground brawls. I have a 12 year-old boy and would rather he develop the intelligence to fight with his head than with his fists, and I guess that&rsquo;s the point I want to make. We Christians have to learn to fight, and fight smart, even when the fight turns ugly and requires down and dirty rolling-in-the-dirt gut-punching. Let me explain.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/man2520and2520woman2520fighting1.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 15px; width: 316px; height: 388px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>I have a friend who is in the fight of her life. Well, who am I kidding; I have several friends, as I&rsquo;m sure you do as well, who are in the fights of their lives. What frustrates me is that they don&rsquo;t know it, and I&rsquo;m convinced that even if they did know it, they wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do about it.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s face it - girls aren&rsquo;t supposed to fight. Isn&rsquo;t that what we&rsquo;ve been taught? (Alright, so maybe you&rsquo;re of the male persuasion and it&rsquo;s socially acceptable for you to fight as long as the face you put on over the puffed up chest looks sorry enough.) Would it be liberating to know that God gave you permission to fight and not feel bad about it?</p>\n\n<p>Ephesians 6:10 says that we are to &ldquo;be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.\" Ephesians 6:11 says that we are to &ldquo;take our stand&rdquo; dressed in God&rsquo;s armor. In those two verses we get our first marching orders as soldiers in God&rsquo;s army.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that it is God&rsquo;s army. We are strong in His power, not our own. We&rsquo;ll get to that in a minute. The second thing He tells us is to stand up and fight! Do you know the opposite of a fighter? It&rsquo;s a doormat!</p>\n\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about the enemy, in case you&rsquo;re making a list of car-pool offenders and thinking about that kid who pushed your little one off the swing. Ephesians 6:12 says that our fight isn&rsquo;t with them&hellip;sigh. Unfortunately, our fight is with an unseen enemy who is at work to stir up sin within us.</p>\n\n<p>You know that bad feeling you direct toward the mom who continues to talk on her phone in the carpool line, while her preschool child struggles like a packmule under the weight of a nap mat, backpack, and lunch box&hellip;well, that feeling you have is wrong. Let&rsquo;s just call it what it is.</p>\n\n<p>So, to recap: we are in a fight, we fight with all the power of the Almighty, and our fight is primarily with our own sin provoked by an enemy we can&rsquo;t see. The only way to win this fight is by putting on our armor and answering the call to battle. We are to stand up and fight.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I&rsquo;m a very practical person. I need to know what standing up and fighting looks like. Even better, I want to see it demonstrated. I suspect you too would like an explanation of how to fight in God&rsquo;s power, right? Here&#39;s where I found the answer and most of the instruction you need to get armored, stand up and fight:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Son is the radiance of God&#39;s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.&rdquo; (Hebrews 1:3)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.&rdquo; (John 1:14a)</p>\n\n<p>In order to fight with God&rsquo;s power, you must first have the word of God dwelling within you. This means we have not only God&#39;s Spirit, Who is the seal of our salvation, but truly we are also to have His word in a very tangible way.</p>\n\n<p>In John 14:26, we&#39;re told that one of the Spirit&rsquo;s purposes in our lives is to remind us of Jesus&#39; instructions to His Church. Though God can do anything, He isn&#39;t likely to remind us of His words if we haven&#39;t already taken time to consider them. Remember, nothing in, nothing out.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard all this before, and if so, I&rsquo;m probably beginning to sound like Charlie Brown&rsquo;s teacher (i.e., \"Bwah bwah, bwah bwah bwah bwah...\"), but don&#39;t overlook the truth of the familiar. God&#39;s word is all-important in our fight, and as Ephesians 6:12 says, we are securely held by our salvation, but our sword is the word of God.</p>\n\n<p>Did you get that? Without our weapon at the ready, the enemy is wailing on our heads! Though our victory is assured in the end (by God&#39;s grace), nevertheless we can only stand there and take his blows unless we fight back! Without God&#39;s word, we have no defense! (By the way, fighting without God&#39;s word in hand was Adam and Eve&#39;s battle plan against Satan in the Garden, and we all know how that fight turned out!)</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but the thought of fighting unarmed just makes me mad! I mean punch-him-in-the-gut mad!</p>\n\n<p>By God&#39;s grace, we don&#39;t have to enter the fight defenseless. Instead, I&#39;m going to take up my sword, which cuts coming and going, penetrating to my very soul and judges my thoughts and attitudes by calling them what they are (Hebrews 4:12).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;m going to take those thoughts and attitudes captive to the mind of Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5). I&rsquo;m going to look for a way out of temptation, which God promises to offer me (1 Corinthians 10:13), and I&rsquo;m going to choose it over temptation.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I&rsquo;m gonna whack my enemy on the head with my sword, &#39;cause I&rsquo;m not the kind of girl you&rsquo;d call a doormat!</p>\n\n<p>So, as I watch the oblivious soccor mom sitting in the carpool lane and hear the enemy whisper in my ear, &ldquo;Will you just look at her,&rdquo; I will be ready with my sword to remind myself &ldquo;greater love has no man than this.\" And I will beat him back.</p>\n\n<p>When the enemy tells me that revenge is sweet and can be its own form of justice, I will strike a blow by replying, the Lord says that we are to \"heap blessings on our enemy, seventy times seven.\"</p>\n\n<p>When I hear the enemy say that I am too weak for this trial, this illness, this temptation, this disappointment, I will lean on my sword remembering that God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong, and I will delight in my weaknesses and difficulties for when I am weak, then I am strong.</p>\n\n<p>Now this is fighting! I&rsquo;m fighting in the strength of God&rsquo;s word, with His word is my weapon. Every now and again I may get beat down, usually because I haven&rsquo;t been training enough, and then the best I can do is pull out the below-the-belt punch: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna tell my Daddy, and He&rsquo;s gonna crush your head!\" OK, so it&rsquo;s a little immature, but it&rsquo;s still truth as I read it in the word!!</p>\n\n<p>So let me ask the question again. When was the last time you got into a fight? I hope it was today! See you on the playground!</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For the Lord your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory.\" Deuteronomy 20:4&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tThe 2001 Walt Disney movie, The Princess Diaries, provides an unintentional picture of <strong>salvation in cinema</strong> to believers.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere is the plot summary of the movie from imdb.com:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Mia, a socially awkward but very bright 15-year-old girl being raised by a single mom, discovers that she is the princess of a small European country because of the recent death of her long-absent father, who (unknown to her) was the crown prince of Genovia. She must make a choice between continuing the life of a San Francisco teen or stepping up to the throne. While Mia makes up her mind, she&#39;s pressed into taking princess lessons from her grandmother.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/the-princess-diaries-2001.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 210px; height: 300px; \" /></em></p>\n<p>\n\tLet&#39;s take a look at some of the events of the story and see what they show us:</p>\n<p>\n\t1. Mia is born as royalty. She is a princess in the kingdom of Genovia from the day of her birth. She did nothing to merit, earn, or somehow contribute towards her royal status. Similarly, when believers are born physically they are already chosen by G-d. We are already part of G-d&#39;s eternal kingdom.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider Paul&#39;s words to the believers in Ephesus:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. (Ephesians 1:3-6)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tPlease note two things from this passage:</p>\n<p>\n\t1. G-d did the choosing. It does not say that we chose G-d but that He chose us.<br />\n\t2. The choosing occurred at the beginning \"before the foundation of the world.\" We were not present with Him at the beginning of creation to participate in any way in our salvation.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul makes a similar statement to the believers in Thessalonica:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth. (2 Thessalonians 2:13)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tSalvation does not ever depend upon our actions. As Paul puts it in Romans 9:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy. (Romans 9:16)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWhy is this so? It is because G-d does the choosing. From the moment of our creation we are part of G-d&#39;s eternal kingdom.</p>\n<p>\n\t2. Mia is unaware of her special status as royalty and lives the first fifteen years of her life in a rather unremarkable manner. She appears to be a bright but otherwise unexceptional girl.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a similar manner, those who are chosen by G-d but are unaware of it live their lives in an unremarkable fashion... doing the things of the world and walking in darkness. As Paul describes it in Ephesians 5:8, \"...you were formerly darkness, now you are Light in the Lord...\"</p>\n<p>\n\tEven if by chance Mia had performed some action that was royal in nature it would have been viewed as pretentious (at worst) or simply odd (at best) since neither she nor anyone around her was aware of her true royal status. There was no visible connection between her actions and her (as yet unknown) royalty. This brings to mind a passage in the writings of the prophet Isaiah:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. (Isaiah 64:6)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAny act of righteousness (i.e. righteous deeds/good deeds/good works) that are separated from G-d&#39;s direction to do that act are like a \"filthy garment\" [literally: a menstrual cloth].</p>\n<p>\n\tLike Mia, those whom G-d has chosen but are unaware of that election are unaware of their special status and walk in the darkness of their ignorance.</p>\n<p>\n\t3. Mia is visited by a special messenger: her grandmother, the queen of Genovia. It is her grandmother who informs Mia of her father&#39;s royal lineage and thus her own royal position of princess.</p>\n<p>\n\tBelievers are also visited by a special messenger to inform them of their special status: the Holy Spirit (Hebrew: ruach Hakodesh). As Peter notes in his first letter:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven--things into which angels long to look. (1 Peter 1:12)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tPaul also tells us that the gospel (the good news of Messiah and his kingdom) come to us by the Holy Spirit:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>...for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction... (1 Thessalonians 1:5)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t4. Mia&#39;s grandmother, the same messenger who informs Mia of her royalty, also sets forth a new set of standards for Mia&#39;s behavior and establishes new expectations for the young princess. She must conform her speech and actions to behavior that is fitting to her new found status.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a similar fashion, the Holy Spirit begins writing the Law [Hebrew: Torah] of G-d upon our hearts as the New Covenant promises:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Behold, days are coming,\" declares the LORD, \"when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them,\" declares the LORD. But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,\" declares the LORD, \"I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. (Jeremiah 31:31-33)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAs Peter exhorts us in his first epistle:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, \"YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.\" (1 Peter 1:14-16)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tJust as the queen exhorts her princess granddaughter to act like the princess she is, so Peter also exhorts believers to live like the citizens of G-d&#39;s kingdom that they are.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Acts 26 Paul relates his encounter with the risen Yeshua and shares these words of the Master:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you; rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you, to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.\" (Acts 26:15-18)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tIn this passage Paul is not commissioned to make unbelievers into believers but to teach believers of the truth of their salvation and to train them so that they may turn from darkness to light. He is being sent so that they will stop living in the dominion of Satan and start living out the truth of their existence as part of the kingdom of G-d and the commonwealth of Isra&#39;el:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called \"Uncircumcision\" by the so-called \"Circumcision,\" which is performed in the flesh by human hands-- remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. (Ephesians 2:11-13)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Holy Spirit, the same messenger that informs believers of their salvation, also testifies to the world that we are children of the King:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him. (Romans 8:16-17)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWith the help of others around her, Mia&#39;s grandmother trains Mia to live the life of a princess. In doing so she is set apart and \"sanctified\" to her position. Sanctified means \"set apart\" and Mia&#39;s behavior must be set apart in order to reflect her \"set apart\" position. Note that Mia&#39;s behavior does not make her a princess. She was a princess at birth. Her behavior is simply a reflection of the knowledge of who she is.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Holy Spirit, through the lives of other believers around us, also conforms us into the pattern established for us:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; (Romans 8:29)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. (Romans 12:1-2)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tScripture describes two realms: one of darkness and one of light. Although believers are \"Light in the Lord\" we formerly walked in darkness. Paul admonishes us that we should walk as children of Light (Ephesians 5:8). The Master, Himself, says:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.\" (John 8:12)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"I have come as Light into the world, so that everyone who believes in Me will not remain in darkness.\" (John 12:26)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tMia&#39;s training is all encompassing: how she stands, how she sits, how she walks, how she talks, how she eats, how she waves... Everything she does is adjusted and conformed to the standard of her position.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul exhorts the believers in Corinth:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. (1 Corinthians 10:31)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tHe also exhorts the believers in Ephesus:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>..for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light (for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth), trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. (Ephesians 5:8-10)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAt various points Mia despairs and nears the point of abandoning her position and seeking to avoid the responsibility that has been thrust upon her. It is a high and demanding calling and her character is tested.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a similar manner, believers are often tried, tested, and tempted. Scripture provides cautions regarding testing (e.g. 2 Corinthians 2:9, 2 Corinthians 13:5-6, 1 Timothy 3:10, Hebrews 11:17, 1 Peter 1:7, 1 John 4:1). Scripture provides observations about temptation (e.g. 1 Corinthians 10:13, Galatians 6:1, Hebrews 2:18, James 1:13-14). It also provides many exhortations to stand firm (1 Corinthians 16:13, Ephesians 6:11, 6:13-14, Philippians 4:1, 1 Thessalonians 3:8, 2 Thessalonians 2:15, 1 Peter 5:12)</p>\n<p>\n\tNobody is forcing Mia to choose this new life. Indeed, some are trying to talk her out of it. She must make her own choice. This brings to mind a famous passage from Scripture:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.\" (Joshua 24:15)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t5. Mia does not train and prepare just so she can do the things a princess does. Her training and preparation have a purpose: one day she will be queen and she must be prepared to rule.</p>\n<p>\n\tBelievers also are being trained to rule, to rule in G-d&#39;s kingdom.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny us; If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself. (2 Timothy 2:12-13).</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>And they sang a new song, saying, \"Worthy are You to take the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth.\" (Revelation 5:9-10).</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years. (Revelation 20:6).</em></p>\n<p>\n\tLike Mia in the movie \"The Princess Diaries.\" believers in the risen Messiah live the following experiences:</p>\n<p>\n\t&bull; Born as Royalty<br />\n\t&bull; Unaware of Special Status<br />\n\t&bull; Awakened to the Truth By a Special Messenger<br />\n\t&bull; Given a New Set of Standards and Expectations<br />\n\t&bull; Trained to Live as Royalty<br />\n\t&bull; Trained in Preparation to Rule</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is the conclusion of all this?</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. (Hebrews 12:1 NIV)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tMay we strive by the power of the Spirit of G-d to be conformed to the image of Christ and live our lives in the knowledge of who we are and who we have been chosen to be.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.\" (Galatians 2:20)</em></p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tThe Merriam-Webster Word of the Day for October 21st was <em>renovate</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>1: to restore to a former better state (as by cleaning, repairing, or rebuilding)<br />\n\t2: to restore to life, vigor, or activity : revive</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;Renovate,&rdquo; &ldquo;renew,&rdquo; &ldquo;restore,&rdquo; &ldquo;refresh,&rdquo; and &ldquo;rejuvenate&rdquo; all mean to make like new. &ldquo;Renovate&rdquo; suggests a renewing by cleansing, repairing, or rebuilding. &ldquo;Renew&rdquo; implies a restoration of what had become faded or disintegrated so that it seems like new (&ldquo;efforts to renew the splendor of the old castle&rdquo;). &ldquo;Restore&rdquo; suggests a return to an original state after depletion or loss (&ldquo;restored a piece of furniture&rdquo;). &ldquo;Refresh&rdquo; implies the supplying of something necessary to restore lost strength, animation, or power (&ldquo;a refreshing drink&rdquo;). &ldquo;Rejuvenate&rdquo; suggests the restoration of youthful vigor, powers, or appearance (&ldquo;she was rejuvenated by her new job&rdquo;). &ldquo;Renovate&rdquo; has &ldquo;newness&rdquo; in its origins: it ultimately derives from the Latin verb &ldquo;novare,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;to make new,&rdquo; itself a descendant of &ldquo;novus,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;new.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\tABC&rsquo;s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition series is a reality television series providing home renovations for less fortunate families, hosted by Ty Pennington. On the series, people who are unable to help themselves are given help by others to demolish their existing home and replace it with one that is far superior to the original in every respect: size, features, amenities, and furnishings.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe show was highly popular because of its themes regarding redemption, mercy, and community.&nbsp;There is a similar story told in Scripture.&nbsp;You might call it Extreme Makeover: Fallen Creation Edition.&nbsp;This story also tells about redemption, mercy, and community. G-d&rsquo;s redemption and mercy upon His community of believers.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe promotion for this series began a few thousand years ago with the prophet Isaiah:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>&ldquo;For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; And the former things will not be remembered or come to mind.&rdquo; (Isaiah 65:17)</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tand again...</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>&ldquo;For just as the new heavens and the new earth Which I make will endure before Me,&rdquo; declares the LORD, &ldquo;So your [Israel&#39;s] offspring and your name will endure. And it shall be from new moon to new moon And from sabbath to sabbath, All mankind will come to bow down before Me,&rdquo; says the LORD. &ldquo;Then they will go forth and look On the corpses of the men Who have transgressed against Me. For their worm will not die And their fire will not be quenched; And they will be an abhorrence to all mankind.&rdquo; (Isaiah 66:22-24)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tPeter also wrote about this coming attraction:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells. Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless, and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you, as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction. (2 Peter 3:13-16)</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe most recent word of Scripture about the Extreme Makeover: Fallen Creation Edition is found in the book of Revelation:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea. And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them, and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.&rdquo; And He who sits on the throne said, &ldquo;Behold, I am making all things new.&rdquo; And He *said, &ldquo;Write, for these words are faithful and true.&rdquo; Then He said to me, &ldquo;It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost. He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son.&rdquo; (Revelation 21:1-7)</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThere are generally two schools of thought regarding how this will work:</p>\n<p>\n\tThe traditional Christian teaching is that it will be much like Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. The old heavens and the old earth will be completely obliterated. Time and space will cease to exist and G-d will start over from scratch and populate the world with new creatures who are the faithful in Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe much older traditional Hebraic teaching about the new heavens and the new earth is one of renovation: G-d is going to burn the world with fire and cleanse away all of the impurities resulting from sin and leave behind what is holy, spotless, and pure. This fits with Paul&rsquo;s writings in 1 Corinthians:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man&rsquo;s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man&rsquo;s work. If any man&rsquo;s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. (1 Corinthians 3:12-15)</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tPaul is specifically speaking of our works being tested with fire and that which is good will remain, however, the Hebraic understanding of &ldquo;the new heavens and new earth&rdquo; is not the Western teaching of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. It is instead one of renovating: making all things like new&hellip; like they were at Creation. It is a simple thing to destroy a flawed construction and build something new from scratch. It is much more difficult (and more glorifying to G-d!) to take a flawed Creation and do a heavy-duty restoration job on it to make it better than it was originally.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Messiah states in Revelation 21:5 &ldquo;I am making all things new.&rdquo; If He is taking Believer Bob and making him into a completely new creation then it is no longer Believer Bob&hellip; it is someone new: Christian Chuck, perhaps. If, however, Messiah takes Believer Bob and &ldquo;renovates&rdquo; him and makes Bob as he was intended to be from Creation but without sin then that is the model that fully fits with Scripture. The flaws, the dross, is burned up and we are renewed in our faith in Messiah&hellip; spiritually regenerated now and physically regenerated upon His glorious return.</p>\n<p>\n\tOh, Lord, hasten the day!</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. (1 Tim 1:17)</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tOne of the ideas reiterated throughout this blog has been &ldquo;words have power&rdquo;. One particular example that I often share with friends and family is the expression &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\tI&#39;m Sorry</h3>\n<p>\n\tIn a literal sense saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; means &ldquo;I am wretched, worthess, poor.&rdquo;&nbsp;Why would someone say such a thing?&nbsp;Aren&rsquo;t we created in the image of G-d? (Genesis 1:26)</p>\n<p>\n\tThis &ldquo;wretched&rdquo; meaning dates back to the 13th century and a time when people would debase themselves before some nobleman or leader as a result of some offense. They would essentially say &ldquo;I am wretched, worthless, and poor&rdquo; and seek the nobleman&rsquo;s mercy and favor.&nbsp;In declaring themselves to be &ldquo;wretched&rdquo; they were giving a reason for:</p>\n<p>\n\ta) &nbsp;Why they did the thing that caused offense (i.e. I&rsquo;m a wretched excuse for a human being).</p>\n<p>\n\tor</p>\n<p>\n\tb) &nbsp;Why they deserved mercy (I&rsquo;m wretched and don&rsquo;t deserve mercy but I seek it anyway).</p>\n<p>\n\tThis approach is flawed because debasing ourselves in order to excuse our bad behavior or as a reason we should receive mercy is not consistent with Scripture.&nbsp;The idea of &ldquo;giving a reason&rdquo; or &ldquo;giving an answer&rdquo; is encapsulated in the Greek word apologia. You might recognize this word as the root of our modern English &ldquo;apology&rdquo; or &ldquo;apologize&rdquo;. The concept of &ldquo;apologetics&rdquo; (defending your faith) also stems from this Greek word.</p>\n<h3>\n\tI Apologize</h3>\n<p>\n\tPaul begins his discourse in Acts 22:1 by saying &ldquo;hear my defense&rdquo; using the word apologia.&nbsp;Instead of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; we sometimes hear people use the expression &ldquo;I apologize.&rdquo;&nbsp;In a literal sense saying &ldquo;I apologize&rdquo; means &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving an answer/excuse/defense&rdquo; for what I have done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"I did [offense] and it offended you...here is my excuse for what I did...that excuse should be a satisfactory reason for you to forgive me.\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis approach comes with the incorrect assumption that by providing an excuse or a reason (i.e. by defending my actions) I am now worthy or capable of being forgiven.&nbsp;While the approach is flawed this particular example points us to the crux of the matter: forgiveness.</p>\n<h3>\n\tPlease Forgive Me</h3>\n<p>\n\tPeter asks Messiah how often we should forgive sins against us. The Lord answers the question by saying &ldquo;seventy times seven&rdquo; (Matthew 18:22). He did not mean 490 times (as if we should keep a running tally of the number of times we have forgiven someone!), he simply meant that we should completely forgive as often as necessary, seven being symbolic of fullness or completeness.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we sin (through words, actions, or inaction) against another person there is a debt we now owe them as a consequence. It is this debt that Messiah says we should forgive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. (Matthew 6:12)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tScripture shows us the pattern of the appropriate response in these situations:</p>\n<p>\n\ta) Confess</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much. (James 5:16)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tb) Take responsibility</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. (1 John 1:8)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tc) Seek forgiveness</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions. (Matthew 6:14-15)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMy own personal pattern for dealing with my sin and offense against others:</p>\n<p>\n\ta) &nbsp;Address the person by name and confess my action hurt or offended them,<br />\n\tb) &nbsp;Take responsibility for what I did,<br />\n\tc) &nbsp;Ask the other person to forgive me.</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tInstead of saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; or &ldquo;I apologize&rdquo; the following is far more Scriptural and appropriate:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;Jeff, I realize that my words hurt your feelings.&nbsp;I spoke them in anger and I was wrong.&nbsp;Please forgive me for saying that to you and hurting your feelings.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\tDon&rsquo;t debase yourself and say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t defend yourself and say &ldquo;I apologize.&rdquo;&nbsp;Do confess your sin and seek forgiveness.&nbsp;If we approached both G-d and men with genuine humility in dealing with all of our sins in a manner such as this then believers would all be in a better state.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. (1 Tim 1:17)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tOne of the ideas reiterated throughout this blog has been &ldquo;words have power&rdquo;. One particular example that I often share with friends and family is the expression &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\tI&#39;m Sorry</h4>\n<p>\n\tIn a literal sense saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; means &ldquo;I am wretched, worthess, poor.&rdquo;&nbsp;Why would someone say such a thing?&nbsp;Aren&rsquo;t we created in the image of G-d? (Genesis 1:26)</p>\n<p>\n\tThis &ldquo;wretched&rdquo; meaning dates back to the 13th century and a time when people would debase themselves before some nobleman or leader as a result of some offense. They would essentially say &ldquo;I am wretched, worthless, and poor&rdquo; and seek the nobleman&rsquo;s mercy and favor.&nbsp;In declaring themselves to be &ldquo;wretched&rdquo; they were giving a reason for:</p>\n<p>\n\ta) &nbsp;Why they did the thing that caused offense (i.e. I&rsquo;m a wretched excuse for a human being).</p>\n<p>\n\tor</p>\n<p>\n\tb) &nbsp;Why they deserved mercy (I&rsquo;m wretched and don&rsquo;t deserve mercy but I seek it anyway).</p>\n<p>\n\tThis approach is flawed because debasing ourselves in order to excuse our bad behavior or as a reason we should receive mercy is not consistent with Scripture.&nbsp;The idea of &ldquo;giving a reason&rdquo; or &ldquo;giving an answer&rdquo; is encapsulated in the Greek word apologia. You might recognize this word as the root of our modern English &ldquo;apology&rdquo; or &ldquo;apologize&rdquo;. The concept of &ldquo;apologetics&rdquo; (defending your faith) also stems from this Greek word.</p>\n<h3>\n\tI Apologize</h3>\n<p>\n\tPaul begins his discourse in Acts 22:1 by saying &ldquo;hear my defense&rdquo; using the word apologia.&nbsp;Instead of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; we sometimes hear people use the expression &ldquo;I apologize.&rdquo;&nbsp;In a literal sense saying &ldquo;I apologize&rdquo; means &ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving an answer/excuse/defense&rdquo; for what I have done.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"I did [offense] and it offended you...here is my excuse for what I did...that excuse should be a satisfactory reason for you to forgive me.\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis approach comes with the incorrect assumption that by providing an excuse or a reason (i.e. by defending my actions) I am now worthy or capable of being forgiven.&nbsp;While the approach is flawed this particular example points us to the crux of the matter: forgiveness.</p>\n<h3>\n\tPlease Forgive Me</h3>\n<p>\n\tPeter asks Messiah how often we should forgive sins against us. The Lord answers the question by saying &ldquo;seventy times seven&rdquo; (Matthew 18:22). He did not mean 490 times (as if we should keep a running tally of the number of times we have forgiven someone!), he simply meant that we should completely forgive as often as necessary, seven being symbolic of fullness or completeness.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we sin (through words, actions, or inaction) against another person there is a debt we now owe them as a consequence. It is this debt that Messiah says we should forgive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. (Matthew 6:12)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tScripture shows us the pattern of the appropriate response in these situations:</p>\n<p>\n\ta) Confess</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much. (James 5:16)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tb) Take responsibility</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. (1 John 1:8)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tc) Seek forgiveness</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions. (Matthew 6:14-15)</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMy own personal pattern for dealing with my sin and offense against others:</p>\n<p>\n\ta) &nbsp;Address the person by name and confess my action hurt or offended them,<br />\n\tb) &nbsp;Take responsibility for what I did,<br />\n\tc) &nbsp;Ask the other person to forgive me.</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tInstead of saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; or &ldquo;I apologize&rdquo; the following is far more Scriptural and appropriate:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;Jeff, I realize that my words hurt your feelings.&nbsp;I spoke them in anger and I was wrong.&nbsp;Please forgive me for saying that to you and hurting your feelings.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\tDon&rsquo;t debase yourself and say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t defend yourself and say &ldquo;I apologize.&rdquo;&nbsp;Do confess your sin and seek forgiveness.&nbsp;If we approached both G-d and men with genuine humility in dealing with all of our sins in a manner such as this then believers would all be in a better state.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. (1 Tim 1:17)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tMy family and I just returned from a trip \"home\" for the Holiday week. I can&#39;t read in the car, or do much of anything else for that matter because I get carsick. My husband likes to drive in silence most of the time, and my son usually has his nose in a book or a video game, so that leaves me to look out the window and read the road signs. Just outside Rolla, Missouri, I noticed a sign that looked like this:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Rolla.........................48<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ............................4</em></p>\n<p>\n\tI know this stretch of road really well given that we have been traveling back and forth on it for about 15 years, but I&#39;ve never noticed this sign before. What was the second line below the entry for Rolla supposed to mean? I had no idea what was ahead in 4 miles, so I began to wonder.</p>\n<p>\n\tIs it a town too small to be worth mentioning? Is it just an exit that would take you East instead of North? As I anxiously awaited the arrival of \"4 miles,\" I worried that I might miss it, now having been appropriately informed, and in that moment I realized that this was something God wanted me to see.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/5011655.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 350px; height: 234px; \" />Have you ever been through one of those seasons of absolute blindness? As a family, we have been through three big ones (though life is full of little ones).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first was when my son was diagnosed with cancer. With very little information available pending staging and protocol, we had to make several major decisions that would profoundly affect the course of the coming year. The second was when we made our first major move which brought us to our current home. The third we just finished passing through.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust that morning my husband had turned down a wonderful job opportunity that would have required us to go blindly into the unknown. However, staying put meant remaining in an equally uncertain situation. We were absolutely unable to see the future of either situation, we only knew that a decision had to be made - and soon. That&#39;s why \"4 miles\" began to have real meaning to me.</p>\n<p>\n\tThrough the stretch of road we traveled anticipating \"4 miles,\" it dawned on me that there was no doubt that we would eventually get there. We were, after all, on the road that predetermined our arrival; we only had to follow it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as far as that goes, we really had no choice. The road required that we steered to stay on course, took the bends and twists and hills with an even speed, and that we did not stop but kept moving ever forward on the course that was already laid out for us.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe didn&#39;t choose the road (there&#39;s only one road home), we only followed it. We didn&#39;t determine its path around, over or through the obstacles that established its topography, we only watched the signs that warned us of what was ahead. Taking the next curve. Topping the next hill. Ever onward, ticking off one mile at a time to finally arrive at the unknown.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose seasons of blindness are just like the road to \"4 miles.\" The destination is uncertain, but the arrival is not. The road ahead is laid out before us; we just have to take one step forward. We only have a road sign or two to warn us of the road conditions, but they&#39;re enough to help us navigate the curves. God has paved the way, He only asks us to follow, and as we do, the destination is revealed along the way.</p>\n<p>\n\tWelcome to \"4 miles.\" It&#39;s not what you thought it would be, but then you never know until you get there!</p>\n"

This week of the year the passages that are studied are found in the book of Genesis chapters 28:10- 32:2. The chapter and verse numbers that we use to identify passages of Scripture today did not exist in the days of the Master. They identified the weekly passages, known as a parashah (&rdquo;portion&rdquo;) by the first word or two of that passage. This week&rsquo;s parashah is known as Vayetze (pronounced vye YETZ eh). This Hebrew word means &ldquo;to go&rdquo; as it is written in the beginning of our portion:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba and went toward Haran.&rdquo; - Genesis 28:10 (LITV)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>In this week&rsquo;s parashah we find the story of Jacob&rsquo;s ladder (Genesis 28:10-16) and we read that the &ldquo;angels of G-d were going up and going down on it&rdquo; (verse 12). Jacob recognized that the place where he had the vision of the ladder was an intersection between the heavenly realm and the earthly realm and so he named that place Bethel (&rdquo;House of G-d&rdquo;). In John 1:51 the Master tells Nathanael that he would see &ldquo;the angels of G-d ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; Jesus uses the words of Genesis 28 and the imagery of that intersection to describe Himself (the Son of Man). In other words, Jesus would become that point of intersection between the Father in heaven and men on earth. We find that this is true, as it is written in 1 Timothy 2:5,</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;For there is one G-d, and one mediator also between G-d and men, the man Christ Jesus&hellip;&rdquo; (NASB)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tHere in parashah Vayetze is a true portrait of Messiah.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t<strong>The story of the Exodus</strong> from Egypt is found (not surprisingly) in the book of Exodus. The story of Saul, the King of Israel, is found in 1 Samuel. The story of Purim is found in the book of Esther. These three stories are inextricably entwined in ways that may not be readily evident. Let&rsquo;s examine Scripture and see what we can find.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then Amalek came and fought against Israel at Rephidim. So Moses said to Joshua, &ldquo;Choose men for us and go out, fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will station myself on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.&rdquo; Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought against Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. So it came about when Moses held his hand up, that Israel prevailed, and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed. But Moses&rsquo; hands were heavy. Then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other. Thus his hands were steady until the sun set. So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. Then the LORD said to Moses, &ldquo;Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.&rdquo; Moses built an altar and named it The LORD is My Banner; and he said, &ldquo;The LORD has sworn; the LORD will have war against Amalek from generation to generation.&rdquo; (Exodus 17:8-16)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tNote that it does not say that Israel will have war against Amalek but that &ldquo;The LORD&rdquo; will have war against them. Why? Because Amalek sought to destroy G-d&rsquo;s bride, Israel. Where do we see this war surface again? Consider the story of Saul&hellip;</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor. He had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and handsome man, and there was not a more handsome person than he among the sons of Israel; from his shoulders and up he was taller than any of the people. (1 Samuel 9:1)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/dore_09_1sam15_the_death_of_agag.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 384px; height: 481px; \" />Saul was the son of a Benjamite named Kish. Saul becomes king over Israel and is then given an assignment by Samuel the prophet of the LORD:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then Samuel said to Saul, &ldquo;The LORD sent me to anoint you as king over His people, over Israel; now therefore, listen to the words of the LORD. &ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way while he was coming up from Egypt. Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that he has, and do not spare him; but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.&rsquo;&rdquo; Then Saul summoned the people and numbered them in Telaim, 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. Saul came to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the valley. Saul said to the Kenites, &ldquo;Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, so that I do not destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up from Egypt.&rdquo; So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. So Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, which is east of Egypt. He captured Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were not willing to destroy them utterly; but everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying, &ldquo;I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My commands.&rdquo; And Samuel was distressed and cried out to the LORD all night. Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul; and it was told Samuel, saying, &ldquo;Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, then turned and proceeded on down to Gilgal.&rdquo; Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, &ldquo;Blessed are you of the LORD! I have carried out the command of the LORD.&rdquo; But Samuel said, &ldquo;What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?&rdquo; Saul said, &ldquo;They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; but the rest we have utterly destroyed.&rdquo; Then Samuel said to Saul, &ldquo;Wait, and let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; Samuel said, &ldquo;Is it not true, though you were little in your own eyes, you were made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed you king over Israel, and the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, &lsquo;Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are exterminated.&rsquo; Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but rushed upon the spoil and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD?&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then Saul said to Samuel, &ldquo;I did obey the voice of the LORD, and went on the mission on which the LORD sent me, and have brought back Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. But the people took some of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the choicest of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God at Gilgal.&rdquo; Samuel said, &ldquo;Has the LORD as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices As in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, And to heed than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of divination, And insubordination is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has also rejected you from being king.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then Saul said to Samuel, &ldquo;I have sinned; I have indeed transgressed the command of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and listened to their voice. Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me, that I may worship the LORD.&rdquo; But Samuel said to Saul, &ldquo;I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.&rdquo; As Samuel turned to go, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore. So Samuel said to him, &ldquo;The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor, who is better than you. Also the Glory of Israel will not lie or change His mind; for He is not a man that He should change His mind.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;I have sinned; but please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and go back with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.&rdquo; So Samuel went back following Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD. Then Samuel said, &ldquo;Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites.&rdquo; And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, &ldquo;Surely the bitterness of death is past.&rdquo; But Samuel said, &ldquo;As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.&rdquo; And Samuel hewed Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal. (1 Samuel 15:1-33)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAgag was the king of the Amalekites. Here we see once more the LORD had war against Amalek. What then does this have to do with the story of Purim? The book of Esther tells us this:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Now there was at the citadel in Susa a Jew whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite, who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been exiled with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had exiled. He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, his uncle&rsquo;s daughter, for she had no father or mother. Now the young lady was beautiful of form and face, and when her father and her mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter. (Esther 2:5-7)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus to his royal palace in the tenth month which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and kindness with him more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. (Esther 2:16-17)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tHere we find that Mordecai, the hero of the story of Purim, is a descendant of Kish&hellip; just like Saul! His adopted daughter, Esther, becomes the bride of the king. A familiar pattern is beginning to emerge&hellip;</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>After these events King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and established his authority over all the princes who were with him. (Esther 3:1)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid homage to him, Haman was filled with rage. But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him who the people of Mordecai were; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus. (Esther 3:5-6)<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/esther.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: right; width: 288px; height: 384px; \" /></em></p>\n<p>\n\tHere we see Haman, a descendant of Agag (the king whom Saul spared), seek to destroy all the Jews. Once more the Amalekites are attempting to destroy G-d&rsquo;s bride, Israel. Mordecai calls upon the wife of the king to seek deliverance:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, &ldquo;Do not imagine that you in the king&rsquo;s palace can escape any more than all the Jews. For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place and you and your father&rsquo;s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?&rdquo; (Esther 4:13-14)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tEsther heeds Mordecai&rsquo;s words and seeks the mercy of the king.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then Queen Esther replied, &ldquo;If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request; for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed and to be annihilated. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for the trouble would not be commensurate with the annoyance to the king.&rdquo; Then King Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, &ldquo;Who is he, and where is he, who would presume to do thus?&rdquo; Esther said, &ldquo;A foe and an enemy is this wicked Haman!&rdquo; Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen. (Esther 7:3-6)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king&rsquo;s anger subsided. (Esther 7:10)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tEven though Haman was killed, his evil plot to destroy the Jews was still in place. The king then empowered the Jews to fight against that plan and defend themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>In them the king granted the Jews who were in each and every city the right to assemble and to defend their lives, to destroy, to kill and to annihilate the entire army of any people or province which might attack them, including children and women, and to plunder their spoil, on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar). (Esther 8:11-12)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tMordecai is lifted up (much like Joseph) to be ruler over the land.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>For Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews and in favor with his many kinsmen, one who sought the good of his people and one who spoke for the welfare of his whole nation. (Esther 10:3)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had schemed against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to disturb them and destroy them. But when it came to the king&rsquo;s attention, he commanded by letter that his wicked scheme which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. And because of the instructions in this letter, both what they had seen in this regard and what had happened to them, the Jews established and made a custom for themselves and for their descendants and for all those who allied themselves with them, so that they would not fail to celebrate these two days according to their regulation and according to their appointed time annually. (Esther 9:24-27)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWe see that in Exodus the Amalekites sought to destroy the bride of G-d and they were defeated. Saul, a son of Kish, was commanded to destroy the Amalekites but was disobedient and spared Agag. A descendant of Agag, Haman, sought again to destroy the bride of G-d (and the bride of King Ahasuerus) but it was through the plans of another son of Kish, Mordecai, that Haman was defeated. Thus we see the Exodus, Saul, and Purim are all linked&hellip; it is a story of G-d&rsquo;s people&hellip; His Bride&hellip; us.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. (1 Tim 1:17)</em></p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tThis weekend we dismantled the bunk-beds in my son&rsquo;s room and moved all the furniture around to his liking. Some of the furniture required my husband&rsquo;s help to move. As he and I finagled a bookcase into a corner of the room, he had to caution me to take it easy pushing. I was surprised, and commented that I wasn&rsquo;t aware that I was actually contributing that much to the effort. I thought it was significant to realize that I contribute more than I am aware. Let me use two other examples to show you what I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/1_-Finger-PaintingA_tcm18-49832.gif\" style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 300px; height: 216px; \" />When my son was in preschool he had an insightful teacher who was obviously plugged in when God enlightened her to his character. She told me that his main goal in school was to move through the work as quickly as possible so that he could get on with the important thing &ndash; playing. The class was finishing a unit on Indians when it became apparent to me how absolutely true this assessment was.&nbsp; Parents were invited to visit the classroom to view the work the children had done during the unit, including paper bag tee-pees that they had painted with Indian symbols, stripes, animals, etc. I could spot Wil&rsquo;s from the doorway. It was a big smear of finger-painted mud. He had made just enough effort to say that he participated.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tThe other example I want to share is one of those stories that is handed down and passed around so much that you don&rsquo;t know whether it has any foundation. It is utterly ridiculous to the point of being both believable and beyond belief.&nbsp; The story is about a man who sued his car&rsquo;s manufacturer because his car crashed when he set the cruise control and then climbed into the backseat to make a sandwich.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tAnd maybe one more idea while we&rsquo;re on the subject of cars and cruise control. What about your navigational system? When you tell it where to go, will it drive you there if you contribute nothing to the process?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tHere&rsquo;s the Sesame Street application. What do all these stories have in common as they apply to our relationship with God? The answer is&hellip; some participation is required, but we have to be careful to apply just the right amount &ndash; ease up, but don&rsquo;t climb into the backseat.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tI could leave it go right there, but I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Matthew 11:28-30:</p>\n<p>\n\t<i>Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tNot one of the examples I gave you illustrates the right amount of participation with Jesus. When we take His yoke upon us it is light and easy because He&rsquo;s bearing all the weight. We get to tag along like a child at his Daddy&rsquo;s heels, our faces upturned in devoted adoration, and pretend to work with Him. He invites us and includes us and we sweat as we move alongside Him, but we don&rsquo;t know how to hold the reigns or turn the plow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tMake it real. If Jesus had been on the other end of my bookcase, I should have been asking, &ldquo;Is this right? Do I need to lift now? Am I pushing too hard?&rdquo; If Wil had been letting Jesus paint through him, he should have been asking, &ldquo;What color? What shape? What size?&rdquo; If the man in the car&hellip;well, there&rsquo;s really no hope for that man, but when you turn on your Holy Spirit-navigational system you have to ask, &ldquo;Left? Right? How fast? How far?&rdquo;&nbsp; And you have to steer where He tells you to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tDo you see it? It is work at rest. Movement without force. Action without striving. Where my Daddy goes, I want to go too. Unfortunately too many of us have lost that tender innocence in our love for our Father and we&rsquo;ve become independent teenagers off charting our own course and determining our own destinies, captains of our fate. We&rsquo;ve pushed too hard, rushed through the work, or taken our hands off the wheel and disengaged from the process completely. And forget about a yoke, I&rsquo;ll plow my own row thank you! All by myself!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tWell I hate to belabor the point so you&rsquo;ll have to ponder all this as you walk along the furrow with the Lord. I know my shoes are already getting dusty and I can smell the fresh scent of newly tilled soil. Based on what I&rsquo;m experiencing I can reassure you that He&rsquo;ll show you what adjustments you need to make. Just don&rsquo;t wander off, try to pull ahead, or pick your feet up and hang in the yoke. I&rsquo;m thinking that would be unproductive.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tI enjoy scouring the internet looking for interesting news and opinion articles. I particularly enjoy reading news articles that reflect the reality of Scripture, even if the authors themselves are oblivious to the connection. For example, I recently read an article on the Fox News website.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe article reported a dramatic decrease in the percentage of American men and women professing to be Christians. In 2009, only 75% of the adult population describes themselves as Christians, which is the lowest point ever recorded (down 12% since 1990). The drop coincides with a slide in the number of Americans who attend church regularly, and it mirrors membership declines already experienced in most mainline Christian denominations.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"The invisible church\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/congregation_l_lrg(1).gif\" style=\"margin: 15px 10px; float: left; width: 350px; height: 200px;\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tCuriously, the decrease in professing Christians within the American population was not met with a corresponding rise in those professing belief in other world religions &ndash; or even with a rise in atheism. Instead, the \"missing\" Christians continue to profess a belief in God, yet they no longer view themselves as members of any organized religious tradition.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&#39;m sure we could posit several theories to explain this trend, including the possibility that many Christians are simply abandoning traditional denominational churches in favor of home churches or other nontraditional means of worship (some might say returning to traditional means of worship, but I digress).</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, I don&#39;t think the decline is entirely explained by disaffected Christians hiding in their homes. Instead, we&#39;re witnessing a basic Biblical truth at work: not all who claim to follow Christ are Christians.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my teaching I often take opportunity to point out the important distinction Scripture makes between the \"visible\" Church and the \"invisible\" Church. The New Testament uses the term \"church\" (Gr.: ekklesia, \"of the invited\") to describe the Body of Christ, the true, born-again followers of Jesus. All who believe the Gospel are part of this group.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul takes the definition of a Christian one step further in Romans 8:14 by declaring that the true Christian is anyone who is indwelt by the Spirit of God:</p>\n<p>\n\tRom. 8:14: For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, we refer to all true believers within the Body of Christ as the invisible Church, because we can&#39;t see the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The process of becoming \"born again\" is one of Spirit (John 3:6-8), consequently there is no universal, visible sign to distinguish the true Christian from the rest of humanity.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have approximate measures of faith, but they aren&#39;t sufficient to settle the issue. For example, water baptism was given by Jesus to the Church as our outward sign of faith, but little prevents unbelievers from making a false profession and entering the water, so baptism can&#39;t be considered an absolute proof of faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, the the Bible teaches we should expect to see some evidence of salvation as we walk in faith (called the fruit of the Spirit by Paul in Gal 5:22), but these outward conequences of faith aren&#39;t equally apparent among all Christians. Given the limits of human discernment, we simply can&#39;t use spirtual fruit as a reliable measure to distinguish believer from nonbeliever.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo on any given Sunday, many church buildings are host to a mixture of true believers and would-be pretenders masquerading as true Christians, who do not have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. These unbelievers attend church for the same reason they attend other functions like the Rotary Club: church is simply another group association they find useful in some way.</p>\n<p>\n\tTogether, we call this union of believer and unbeliever the \"visible\" Church, because we can \"see\" these two groups congregate together in the name of Christ. Though we use the term \"church,\" we don&#39;t mean that all who enter the building are believers; no more than everything that enters into a garage is a car. The visible Church includes believers and at least a few unbelievers.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen unbelievers attach themselves to a Christian congregation and participate in church functions, we naturally assume they are Christian, but during a time of testing or temptation, these counterfeits can fall away. The unbeliever will turn his back on his Christian association, because there is no true spiritual bond holding them to Christ. As they depart, they betray their true nature and reveal themselves to be lost.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn His parable of the Sower and the Seed found in Luke 8, Jesus taught the inevitability of false converts joining to the Church, who would later fall away under times of stress. Similarly, the writer to the Hebrews defines truth Christian faith as the kind of faith that perseveres until the end:</p>\n<p>\n\tHeb. 3:14 For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end...</p>\n<p>\n\tSeeing the news through Biblical eyes</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the article reported, fewer American&#39;s profess to be Christian today than in the past, but the article makes no distinction between true believers and nominal Christians (Christians in name only, i.e., unbelievers).</p>\n<p>\n\tMore importantly, the article claimed that 76% of American adults are yet still Christians. Is it reasonable to assume that that fully three-quarters of Americans today are truly Christians? I find this highly unlikely. This statistic refers (at best) to the visible Church, which includes both believers and unbelievers. So, as this number declines, which group is actually leaving the Church: believers or unbelievers?</p>\n<p>\n\tIn reality, the number of true Christians in America has never been at risk. Regardless of whether the number of true believers rises or falls, the Lord remains in control of His Church, and He will manage it as He wishes. On the other hand, the number of false believers congregating within the visible Church is declining...just as Scripture predicted.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can find a clear explanation of this trend in Scripture. Paul teaches in his second letter to Thesselonica that the Lord&#39;s return must be preceeded by two notable events:</p>\n<p>\n\t2Th. 2:1 Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him<br />\n\t2Th. 2:2 that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.<br />\n\t2Th. 2:3 Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction.<br />\n\t2Th. 2:4 who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first event that must occur prior to the Lord&#39;s return is the \"apostasy,\" Paul says in verse 3. The word apostasy means a forsaking or defecting from something previously held. For example, when a politician leaves a political party and joins another party, he has become an apostate to his original political party. Similarly, if a college football fan decides to begin cheering for the visiting team, the fan has committed apostasy to his home team.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Apostle Paul says that our Lord&#39;s return comes only after an apostasy of some kind, but what is this apostasy? The apostasy Paul describes is a falling away that takes place within the Church itself. Paul also makes mention of this coming apostasy in 1Timothy 4:1:</p>\n<p>\n\t1Tim. 4:1 But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons...</p>\n<p>\n\tI believe this falling away is already underway within the Church, and not only in the U.S. Church. Western Europe has already become a continent of empty churches, the result of Europeans drifting away to secularlism and other \"doctrines of demons.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tHow can we be sure that true believers aren&#39;t the ones falling away? First, a true believer may \"fall away\" from certain Christian behaviors. He may cease attending church or fall back into patterns of sin, but this isn&#39;t the kind of \"falling away\" that Paul is describing. He describes a falling away that results in people worshipping doctrines of demons instead of Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know from Scripture that a true child of God (i.e., a member of the invisible Church) can never fall away from a relationship with Christ, because Christ&#39;s Spirit dwells within the believer and Christ will never leave us nor foresake us (Heb 13:5). Therefore, the apostasy Paul describes must refer to the defection of the unbelievers from among the visible Church.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the Fox News story describes, we are witnessing the departure of many unbelievers from within the Church, who are leaving to pursue other beliefs or no belief at all. This departure (i.e., the apostasy) will inevitably lead to a smaller visible Church, but it will also yield a higher concentration of true believers. The Apostle John described a similar experience in his day in 1John 2:</p>\n<p>\n\t1John 2:18 Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour.<br />\n\t1John 2:19 They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.<br />\n\t1John 2:20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn describes the departure of men who \"did not really belong to us.\" These apostates were men who pretended to be Christians for a time, but at some later point departed, and when they left, they demonstrated they were not true believers. This is why John says that his readers were unlike these men in that they had the anointing of the Holy Spirit and knew the truth.</p>\n<p>\n\tKnowing the Scriptures indepth allows us to read articles like the one on Fox News with a different appreciation. While some Christians may be discouraged at the news of a shrinking Church, we can find comfort in recognizing our Lord&#39;s return is that much closer. Likewise, we need not lament the departure of those who never belonged to Christ in the first place, though we obviously hope they may one day know the Lord truly.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs someone once said:</p>\n<p>\n\t\"Everyday I read the newspaper and the Bible, because I want to know what both sides are up to!\"</p>\n"

I like the rain, but I don&rsquo;t like to drive in it, because I am frustrated by the people who drive around in the rain with their lights off. I can&rsquo;t see them! Generally speaking, I don&rsquo;t see well to begin with, but the combination of the mist on my windows, the glare on the street, and a steel-grey sky make it nearly impossible for me to see anything that isn&rsquo;t fully illuminated. Oh, I know these lightless drivers can see the road, and they can see me, but I can&rsquo;t see them and that could be tragic!</p>\n\n<p>I was fuming over this a while ago as I was returning from my errands, clutching the steering wheel in white-knuckled terror, when I ran over a spiritual truth. Sometimes, no one can see me. My lights are not on. This fact became glaringly clear as the Lord reminded me of an incident that happened some days ago.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/rain car.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 15px; width: 400px; height: 300px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>I ran into the drugstore &ldquo;real quick&rdquo; just to grab something that was on sale. The gal mistakenly rang it up without my coupon, so three registers later I stood waiting for a manager (second call) to come and make the adjustment. I felt my short afternoon becoming shorter by the minute but not my to-do list.</p>\n\n<p>I know seeing myself in hindsight that my arms were crossed, my brows were knit in barely-concealed frustration, my lips were pursed (around my tongue, which I was biting), and I was glaring in the general vicinity of the cashier who had caused all this inconvenience in the beginning. That&rsquo;s all it was really, an inconvenience, but I had turned it into one black storm, and my lights were not on as I tried to navigate through it. Consider the words of our Lord.</p>\n\n<p>No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light. &ndash; Luke 11:33</p>\n\n<p>Every driver on the street is a soul looking for light. They may be a brother in Christ looking for a ray of hope and encouragement; a sign that they&rsquo;re headed the right direction and are almost home. Often they&rsquo;re the half-blind driver beginning to squint through the gloom, hoping to see even a faint glimmer by which they can navigate. Occasionally they&rsquo;re the drivers who are so completely in the dark that they don&rsquo;t know until they see you that they are on the wrong side of the road, approaching disaster. If your lights aren&rsquo;t on, how can they know?</p>\n\n<p>So, next time you find yourself in the grey, or in a flat out pull-to-the-side-of-the-road squall, remember the drivers out there who need to see you with your lights on.</p>\n\n<p>Ahhh&hellip;there you are!&nbsp;</p>"

Occasionally, we have an opportunity to exchange e-mail with people from other religious faiths and traditions.</p>\n<p>\n\tI often engage in conversations with Catholics on the true definition of the Gospel and Biblical Christianity, and when I go my intent is always the same: to present to them the Biblical truth of salvation by grace through faith alone in Christ. As you might imagine, I receive a variety of responses, and unfortunately this exchange is typical of what I hear. Today, I want to share with you one such exchange between myself and a spokesperson for the Catholic archdiocese of a major U.S. city, who I will call \"Nancy.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tWe join the exchange toward the end of our conversation, beginning with a final question from me to Nancy regarding her belief on how we may be saved:</p>\n<p>\n\t. . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>\n<p>\n\tHi Nancy,</p>\n<p>\n\tYou said that one must &ldquo;secure&rdquo; salvation by living like Christ, by doing works, etc. To paraphrase, would you agree that one can only achieve salvation by being obedient to God (once we have believed in Christ)? If so, then is it fair to say that the Catholic church teaches that we become righteous by our obedience to Christ? I&rsquo;m just trying to clarify what [you have been] taught. Your response has been helpful, and more than I normally get.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks,<br />\n\tBrian</p>\n<p>\n\t---------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>\n\tHi, Brian,</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, by obedience, if by that you mean living according to the Gospel - to the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. We, Catholics, believe that this truth has been given to us by Christ and was entrusted by Him to the Church He founded for this purpose (to receive and understand the truth, led by the Spirit of Truth, to safeguard it and faithfully transmit it.)</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, there have been lots of theological debates around the topic of which you inquire, regarding what St. Paul meant by saved by faith, and what Luther meant by saved by faith alone, and what St. James and Christ Himself meant by works and the need for works in achieving one&#39;s salvation. I [am] no expert in these theological debates and in the terminology of each denomination (and believe me, many a misunderstanding has to do with terminology and nuance -and prejudices- rather than real belief!), but I can say that we do not believe that we \"earn\" or \"win\" or \"merit\" salvation and grace without or apart or aside from Christ, or without Him. Never! (One exception: those who, by no fault of their own, never come to know Christ, but live as best they can, according to the dictates of their consciences and the natural law written by God on our hearts: these may possibly be saved... but always and only by Christ! - thanks to the redemption He won for all.)</p>\n<p>\n\tOur whole living and \"working out our salvation in fear and trembling\" (St. Paul) is in response to Christ: a response of faith, and a response of love. If we \"merit\" anything it&#39;s in the sense in which the Lord Himself says that we will hear the Father say, \"Well done, good and faithful servant...\" - not as if we could, of ourselves and without Christ and a commitment to Him, receive eternal life. Can&#39;t! It&#39;s all about Christ for us. He&#39;s the Beginning and the End, the Alpha and the Omega, the Head of the Body, the Church! He is Our Lord and Savior, the Gate to Heaven, the Door by which we enter, without Whom we cannot see God and attain heaven, which Pope Benedict XVI has said is a Person: God! We want to be with that Person, in fact, with the Triune God, Three Persons in One, for all eternity - so we are baptized into Christ so as to become one with Him and then spend our lives striving to live like that which we are: children of God, lest He not recognize us in the end. (cf. Matthew 8:15-23 and Matthew 25: 31-46)</p>\n<p>\n\tNow... do all baptized Catholics (or Christians in general) live as they ought, as saints? No. Sadly. But Christ knew that... and made provision for that, as we see in the Gospels. He knew we would fall short. He knows we will not all be perfect or perfected by the time we die and must give an account. So... do we all go straight to hell? No. We render an account. We ask forgiveness. And we make reparation - as we all ought when we have wronged someone. Like community service for misdemeanours and \"time out\" for children who have misbehaved. Like buying flowers and mowing the lawn and taking care of old repairs and spending more time talking and listening and stuff like that for husbands who have wronged their wives and failed to live as the husbands they ought to be. Make sense? Simple examples to explain what we believe about \"purgation\" or purgatory after death: we believe we make reparation, we acknowledge our shortcomings and wrongdoing, and make up for it - before being admitted into the King&#39;s Court. We are purified by fire, as St. Paul says, and pay the last penny to the King, as Christ says in a parable about heaven. We get rid of the dross - because we do not \"deserve\" hell, but do not deserve heaven quite yet either! It&#39;s a time, place, state of mercy on God&#39;s part - a mercy won by One on the Cross!</p>\n<p>\n\tHope this helps for now.</p>\n<p>\n\tNancy</p>\n<p>\n\t--------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>\n\tNancy,</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks for your response. You really covered most of what I have read the Catholic church teaches on how to go to heaven. While there are several issues I&rsquo;d like to discuss with you, for now I would like to ask you specifically about our obedience making us righteous.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are several things I could quote regarding the Catholic church&rsquo;s teaching about the necessity for one to become inherently righteous, but I think the following, from the Council of Trent (sixth session), sums it up best:</p>\n<p>\n\tCANON XI.-If any one saith, that men are justified, either by the sole imputation of the justice of Christ, or by the sole remission of sins, to the exclusion of the grace and the charity which is poured forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inherent in them; or even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the favour of God; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p>\n\tCANON XXIV.-If any one saith, that the justice received is not preserved and also increased before God through good works; but that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of Justification obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p>\n\tCANON XXVI.-If any one saith, that the just ought not, for their good works done in God, to expect and hope for an eternal recompense from God, through His mercy and the merit of Jesus Christ, if so be that they persevere to the end in well doing and in keeping the divine commandments; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p>\n\tCANON XXXII.-If any one saith, that the good works of one that is justified are in such manner the gifts of God, as that they are not also the good merits of him that is justified; or, that the said justified, by the good works which he performs through the grace of God and the merit of Jesus Christ, whose living member he is, does not truly merit increase of grace, eternal life, and the attainment of that eternal life,-if so be, however, that he depart in grace,-and also an increase of glory; let him be anathema.</p>\n<p>\n\tClearly, Trent&rsquo;s declarations agree with what you said. Our obedience and good works, done by God&rsquo;s grace, merit eternal life for us, according to Trent. In other words, we are made righteous by our obedience. My question to you is how do you reconcile this infallible doctrine of the Catholic church (and Trent is considered infallible), with the teaching we find in Scripture that says we are made righteous by Christ&rsquo;s obedience?</p>\n<p>\n\tSpecifically, Romans 5:19 says, &ldquo;For as through the one man&#39;s [Adam] disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One [Christ] the many will be made righteous.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tI am impressed by your knowledge of Scripture. So as not to take the above verse out of context, permit me to review Romans chapters 1-5. I realize you are probably familiar with it, but a quick overview sets the context for verse 5:19 to show I have not taken this verse out of context.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIn Romans chapters 1-3, Paul lays out the case that all mankind has sinned against God, they know God exists, but they do not acknowledge Him as God nor do they seek Him. There is none righteous, no not one, not Jew, not Gentile. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Having convicted all humanity of sin, Paul now moves on to how one can be reconciled to God in chapter 4. Using Abraham (who transcends both Jew and Gentile) as his example, Paul demonstrates that a person is justified (i.e., counted righteous in God&rsquo;s eyes) by faith, not by works.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s important to mention here that Paul is not talking about works of the Law, for Abraham came before the Law; therefore, works refers to any human works. We read in v. 4:3, &ldquo;For what does the Scripture say? \"ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.\"&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s point is clear: like Abraham, we are saved by faith, and by faith, God credits, imputes, assigns to us His righteousness. More could be said, but the key point is that it is by faith that God credits righteousness to us, not works.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tHaving made his case that we are justified by faith, Paul begins chapter 5 with this conclusion, &ldquo;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; To make sure we understand this, Paul makes a comparison of how we became sinners and how we can become righteous. He does this by making a parallel comparison and contrast with Adam and Christ. Before we were born, before we did anything, we are counted sinners because of Adam&rsquo;s transgression (5:12).</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, sin was imputed, credited to Adam&rsquo;s progeny because of his transgression. We sin because we are sinners. The Catholic church rightly recognizes this as &ldquo;original sin&rdquo;. Paul then shows that, similarly, believers are counted righteous by Christ&rsquo;s obedience (as contrasted with Adam&rsquo;s transgression). This point was made in chapter 4, and Paul makes it clear that he means we are counted righteous not by what we do, but solely by Christ&rsquo;s obedience.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have always found it odd that the Catholic church recognizes original sin (i.e., the belief that Adam&rsquo;s sin is imputed to all humanity), but at the same time you reject the teaching that our salvation is solely by the imputation of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness to us (see Canon XI above). The entire point of Romans 5 is to emphasize how the two are the same principle, and if the one is true, then the other is true as well. One leads to sin and death, while the other leads to righteousness.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, in context, 5:19 clearly teaches that we are made righteous not by our obedience, as you stated, but by Christ&rsquo;s obedience. This also ties in with many other Scriptures that speak about the righteousness of God. I think 2 Corinthians 5:21 says it well, &ldquo;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&rdquo; Christ took the penalty for our sin, and gave us His righteousness, which is imputed to us by faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is on this basis alone that we are counted righteous, not by any works we do. As Paul makes clear in Titus 3, &ldquo;4 But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, 5 He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&rdquo; It is also why Jeremiah says we will call Him &ldquo;the LORD our righteousness.&rdquo; (Jeremiah 23:6)<br />\n\t<br />\n\tNow, just to make sure I&rsquo;m not reading my view into what Paul has said all the way through chapter 5, I&rsquo;d like to take the Catholic view of salvation and compares it against where Paul goes next in Romans. Throughout Romans, Paul asks the very questions he anticipates his reader will have. If salvation is by grace through faith in Christ yet still depends on our own obedience, I would expect Paul would now move into teaching us how to be obedient to ensure that we will be saved.</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead, Paul&#39;s sixth chapter begins with this question, &ldquo;What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?&rdquo; This question fits perfectly with the logical flow of what Paul has just previously taught. If I am not saved by what I do, but rather am saved solely by faith and Christ&rsquo;s righteousness imputed to me, then the most logical question for Paul to tackle next is, \"Does it matter if I continue to sin?\" Paul goes on to deal with this erroneous thought, proving that his earlier point was that we are saved apart from our own works.</p>\n<p>\n\tI really appreciate your willingness to discuss this.</p>\n<p>\n\tBrian&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tRecently the men of my congregation met and discussed several matters regarding our community. One of the matters discussed was the increase in email traffic, which focused on the activities of the current U.S. administration and the concern it was generating among some of our families.</p>\n<p>\n\tNews and rumors regarding violations of the constitution, health care rationing, socialism, geriatric euthanasia, government funded abortion, and other serious matters abound. Some emails have alleged government conspiracy. The prophet Isaiah had a few words to share about that:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>You are not to say, \"It is a conspiracy!\" In regard to all that this people call a conspiracy, And you are not to fear what they fear or be in dread of it. It is the LORD of hosts whom you should regard as holy. And He shall be your fear, And He shall be your dread. - Isaiah 8:12-13</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThese echo the very <strong>words of the Messiah</strong>:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows. (Matt 10:28-31)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tDo not mistake His point. His point is not \"the sparrows do not fall,\" but rather they do not \"fall to the ground apart from your Father.\" The same applies to us: when we fall (not if), we will not be apart from our Father. G-d is always in control.</p>\n<p>\n\tPlease do not mistake my point on this either. There are definitely matters of concern that we should address lawfully as G-d-fearing citizens of our country. What we should not do is become so absorbed in the skittering flights of fear, panic, and paranoia that have gripped conservatives since the election that we neglect our responsibilities as citizens of G-d&#39;s kingdom.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul cautioned the believers in Ephesus:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. - Ephesians 4:14-16</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis echoes Messiah&#39;s own teaching:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Many will say to Me on that day, \"Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?\" And then I will declare to them, \"I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.&#39;\" Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell--and great was its fall. - Matthew 7:22-27</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Deceiver seeks to distract us from the very One we should be focused upon: Messiah Yeshua:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Yeshua, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. - Hebrews 12:1-2</em></p>\n<p>\n\t\"Conservative\" does not equal \"Believer\"<br />\n\tWhile many conservatives commentators have expressed concern, outrage, anger, and various other emotions about the state of the union over the past six months, they often suggest by their actions that they are not believers. If so, we should weigh that possibility into whether or not we give credence to their claims of faith, especially when they appeal to the \"Christian conservative.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tI do not suggest I know whether they are saved or not. That is knowledge reserved to G-d alone. We should, however, consider these words of Scripture:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another.&#8232; - Galatians 5:19-26</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWe should examine our circumstances soberly and diligently and then move on about our Father&#39;s business. We should not be distracted or paralyzed into inaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\" - Matthew 28:18-20</em></p>\n<p>\n\tDid He not preface His instruction with \"all authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth?\" May we live in faith and trust that He does have all authority and ignore the distractions that would lead us into inaction and disobedience!</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. (1 Tim 1:17)</em></p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>When I was a kid (and not a little kid mind you, but old enough to know better), my friends and I would make prank calls to people randomly chosen from the phone book. I won&rsquo;t ask if you did that too, because I&rsquo;m sure we were the only kids in the country who were that bored.</p>\n\n<p>The best part about this mindless pastime was you didn&rsquo;t know who you had called until they answered. Would it be a cantankerous old man? Would it be an frantic mom with a screaming child in the background? Or maybe it would it be a business! The climax of the prank came at the moment they anwered and you heard, &ldquo;Hello? Hello?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I was reminded of my youthful indescretion recently as I was studying the book of Romans trying to decide who the called are, exactly. In Romans 1:6 Paul addresses his letter to all in Rome who are loved by God and are called to be saints. Later in Romans 8:28-30 comes this thorny passage:</p>\n\n<p><em>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.</em></p>\n\n<p>Theologians have begged to differ over the proper interpretation of these words, and the debate has divided denominations doctrinally since the Reformation. It is still nearly impossible for me, a simple person, to understand these verses, especially when we compare those verses to the words of the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20:</p>\n\n<p><em>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.</em></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/phone.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px 10px 0px; width: 350px; height: 330px; float: left;\" /></p>\n\n<p>We generally interpret this verse in Matthew to mean we should spread the gospel to convert unbelievers to Christianity (though I tend to dispute that interpretatoin &ndash; a subject for a different day), yet it does beg the question: why do we work to spread the gospel if God has already decided who He will call to hear it?</p>\n\n<p>I mean, if there are certain people whom God has called but He has not called everyone, then why doesn&#39;t He sift the wheat from the chaff for us so we can spread the Gospel more easily? If I knew I was preaching to the future Sunday choir, I could preach the Lord&rsquo;s praises like Billy Graham. On the other hand, just the thought of presenting the Good News to a defensive rebel who will resist the message until Jesus comes again strikes dread in my heart.</p>\n\n<p>How do I resolve this dilemma?</p>\n\n<p>Well, the memory of my childhood prank brought me an answer of sorts. I think the reason we continue to go into all the world preaching the Gospel is because we don&rsquo;t know what number God will dial, and therefore we won&rsquo;t know who He is calling until someone says, &ldquo;Hello? Hello?&rdquo; I also know God doesn&#39;t call random numbers like I did. He dials His numbers with a divine purpose, so I can be sure that when His call prompts a \"Hello?\", it will lead to a fruitful conversation.</p>\n\n<p><em>We are, therefore, Christ&#39;s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ&#39;s behalf: Be reconciled to God. - 2Corinthians 5:20</em></p>\n\n<p>What are you waiting for? Grab the white pages and get dialing!&nbsp;</p>"

There are no covenants or neighborhood restrictions, and though there is a leash-law in our tiny community, the four police officers in town have better things to do than doggie-patrol, I guess. That means that all the neighborhood dogs have developed a sort of nomadic lifestyle, wandering into and out of the yards of our subdivision. That&rsquo;s alright with most folks and their dogs, but Shalee is different.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/AmericanTreeingFeistGrommetWoods.JPG.jpeg\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px 10px 0px; width: 247px; height: 369px; float: left;\" />Shalee is a Brindle Coated American Squirrel Dog. Yeah. That&rsquo;s what I thought. She&rsquo;s a beautiful dog, resembling a smallish Greyhound, but she is by far the squirreliest dog I have ever encountered&hellip;and dumb. She will run &ndash; Greyhound speed &ndash; straight at you and will not stop until she has careened into your legs causing you to collapse on top of her. Even if you&rsquo;re standing still, it&rsquo;s a sure bet that if Shalee is around, you&rsquo;re going down. Here&rsquo;s the dumb part. Down the road a bit, there is a small horse farm where Shalee decided to branch out. Shalee&rsquo;s owners had only this to say, &ldquo;We nearly bought a horse.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s how Shalee came to be a prisoner of the invisible fence. She is, to my knowledge, the only convict in the neighborhood. It&rsquo;s not as bad as it sounds since our lots have at least one acre, and Shalee happens to own the two giant oak trees that survived from when the subdivision was pasture land. She&rsquo;s made good use of those trees now that they are her only companions. (Even the dogs won&rsquo;t go near her.</p>\n\n<p>The little Dachshund that used to live with her has taken up residence with the neighbor behind us&hellip;no kidding.) Just this afternoon as I walked past my window, I saw Shalee sitting at the foot of one of the trees in her yard staring intently into its branches. There are no squirrels there (I mentioned dumb, didn&rsquo;t I?), but you can&rsquo;t tell her that! She is so focused on every rustle of leaf and bow of branch that no distraction could tempt her eyes to wander from that tree for even a glimpse. She sits like that for hours. And in that snapshot of her today I learned something from dumb-dog Shalee.</p>\n\n<p>Shalee was engrossed in her task &ndash; the task of watching, waiting, listening. She was immersed in her undertaking, gripped by her duty, and captivated by the possibilities before her. She sat without moving (no small feat), her attention never wavering from what held her gaze. She was utterly focused on that tree, and in that moment I saw myself as I ought to be. As Jesus told Martha to be.</p>\n\n<p>As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord&#39;s feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, \"Lord, don&#39;t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!\" \"Martha, Martha,\" the Lord answered, \"you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better and it will not be taken away from her. - Luke 10:38-42</p>\n\n<p>Though I hate to admit it, I am very much like Shalee before her first jolt, and I too deserve to be restrained by a strong electrical current much of the time. I am so busy running blindly into things and people, effectively clipping them off at the knees, taking on tasks too big for my britches, and generally making a nuisance of myself that no one wants to be around me. I nag. I worry. I complain. I&rsquo;m critical and harsh. I&rsquo;m uncontrolled. I&rsquo;m unfocused. I am a whirlwind of useless activity that accomplishes nothing of eternal value.</p>\n\n<p>Look at this snapshot from the verses above. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord&#39;s feet listening to what he said (Luke 10:39). That&rsquo;s what I saw when I glimpsed Shalee out my window, and my heart longed for the ability to sit with rapt attention at the feet of my Lord. I wished for the capacity for focused, unwavering anticipation and confident expectation to the exclusion of the world around me. Dishes can wait. Laundry can wait. Work can wait. I am listening to my Lord. It is the better thing.</p>\n\n<p>Even if it takes a jolt or two, I pray that one day you might glimpse me through the window and find me sitting like Shalee, held spellbound, as if God Himself were in that tree.&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tAs we look at <strong>Psalm 18</strong>, it&rsquo;s helpful to understand the context in which David wrote this Psalm. The Psalm actually also appears in 2 Samuel 22. It&rsquo;s in this and the previous chapter (21) that we find out why David is writing this Psalm to the Lord.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2 Samuel 21:15-22, we read of David being at war again with the Philistines, against relatives of Goliath, whom David had killed. In all of these battles, David is delivered safely. At the beginning of 2 Samuel 22, then, we read, &ldquo;1 And David spoke the words of this song to the LORD in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.&rdquo; This is also the beginning of Psalm 18. So, we see that David is specifically praising God for delivering him from the hand of his enemies and from Saul, who had tried to kill David.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs an overview, the Psalm is an exaltation of God&rsquo;s deliverance and protection. We&rsquo;re told right away that it is a &ldquo;Psalm of David&rdquo;, and he uses great imagery that helps us understand how powerful is God&rsquo;s protection for His people, and His justice against His enemies. From this Psalm, we also learn about God&rsquo;s character. It is a Psalm that gives assurance and comfort to God&rsquo;s people. As we read it, we should always be looking for Messiah in these verses, for as Jesus said, &ldquo;it is these that testify about Me.&rdquo; (John 5:39)</p>\n<p>\n\tVerse 1 &ndash; As mentioned this is a Psalm of David. When David says &ldquo;I love you, O LORD, my strength&rdquo;, he does not use the typical Hebrew word for love to show human love for another (&lsquo;ahab). Rather, he uses the word &ldquo;racham&rdquo;, which means &ldquo;to love, love deeply, have mercy, be compassionate, have tender affection, have compassion&rdquo;. As far as I can tell, this word is only here translated as &ldquo;love&rdquo;; everywhere else, it is translated primarily as &ldquo;mercy&rdquo; or &ldquo;compassion.&rdquo; It has also been described as carrying the idea of cherishing, soothing, and in a gentle emotion of the mind. It&rsquo;s as if David&rsquo;s love (and likewise, ours) finds comfort, mercy, and compassion in the strength and help of the Lord.</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 2-3 &ndash; &ldquo;2The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. 3I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, And I am saved from my enemies.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis passage strongly emphasizes God&rsquo;s protection, the One in whom we can find safety. Recall that God provided David refuge and shelter in the mountains and caves while running from Saul, to which &ldquo;rock&rdquo; may refer. The words &ldquo;rock&rdquo; and &ldquo;fortress&rdquo; also refer to mountaintop strongholds, a place where it would be almost impossible for an enemy to attack. Moreover, God is our shield, our strength (horn). Given the context,salvation here refers more to safety or deliverance as opposed to salvation in the eternal sense, although that would also be true. The one who calls upon the Lord for deliverance finds the ultimate refuge, against which no enemy can conquer. For this, we praise God.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile deliverance and refuge was true for David in his earthly life, it is also true for us, sometimes in this life, but always eternally. There are times the Lord does not deliver us from our enemies; Stephen in Acts is an example. Ultimately, though, God does deliver us and is our rock. As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15: &ldquo;55O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?\" 56The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; 57but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 58Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThis brings to mind our brother in Christ, a man named Salavat. He is an Uzbekistan Christian, and is persecuted for his faith by the government. He has been imprisoned numerous times, yet when he is released, he always goes back to preaching, which is to what God has called him. Church members must meet outside of their village where they could pray and worship without fear of anyone hearing. Despite all of these troubles, Salavat says that over and over, the Lord provided for his family. He continues preaching despite the persecution because his refuge is in the Lord, and the Lord has delivered him and provided for him and his family. May we be like Salavat, our Uzbek brother in Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, this also brings to mind our Lord Jesus, as He placed His full trust in God the Father. He was delivered when He overcame death and took up His life again in the resurrection.</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 4-6 &ndash; &ldquo;4The cords of death encompassed me, And the torrents of ungodliness terrified me. 5The cords of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me. 6In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried to my God for help; He heard my voice out of His temple, And my cry for help before Him came into His ears.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid paints the picture here of someone in what is practically a hopeless situation, where you cannot see any way of surviving with your life. Destruction and death is compared to a raging river (torrents) of continual ungodliness that is pursuing David. In his desperation, he calls out to the Lord.</p>\n<p>\n\tGod hears David&rsquo;s voice, just as surely as He will hear our voice if we call out to Him. God will only hear those who have been given the gift of faith, for without faith it is impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6). Note that God heard &ldquo;out of His temple&rdquo;, which in David&rsquo;s day was God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Under the New Covenant, believers are the temple of God, whose Holy Spirit indwells us (1 Corinthians 3:16). Therefore, when we call, God is never far away.</p>\n<p>\n\tNote that sometimes, however, when we call God does not answer. This does not necessarily mean He is ignoring us. Rather, it may mean He has other plans more</p>\n<p>\n\timportant than an immediate answer to our situation. An example of this is found in Habakkuk 1. In this situation, the Lord gives Habakkuk an explanation of why He is not answering. We may not receive such an explanation. In times like that, we must simply trust that whatever the Lord is doing, it is for our good and His glory (Romans 8:28).</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 7-15 &ndash; &ldquo;7Then the earth shook and quaked; And the foundations of the mountains were trembling And were shaken, because He was angry. 8Smoke went up out of His nostrils, And fire from His mouth devoured; Coals were kindled by it. 9He bowed the heavens also, and came down With thick darkness under His feet. 10He rode upon a cherub and flew; And He sped upon the wings of the wind. 11He made darkness His hiding place, His canopy around Him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies. 12From the brightness before Him passed His thick clouds, Hailstones and coals of fire. 13The LORD also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered His voice, Hailstones and coals of fire. 14He sent out His arrows, and scattered them, And lightning flashes in abundance, and routed them. 15Then the channels of water appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare At Your rebuke, O LORD, At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tHere is an incredible scene, as David puts into words what happens when the Lord becomes angry. His creation literally trembles. Great mountains that appear immovable have their very foundations shaken. God&rsquo;s anger is so great that the devouring fire that comes from His mouth produces smoke from His nostrils. God here is pictured as coming in a great thunderstorm, out of which He brings hailstones, coals of fire, and arrows of lightning to destroy His adversaries.</p>\n<p>\n\tNote, too, that the Lord &ldquo;flew&rdquo; when He heard David&rsquo;s prayer; He did not delay to save His own. When someone attacks one of God&rsquo;s children, he is attacking God Himself. We see this in Acts 9, a passage that is not all that different from Psalm 18 when you think about it. For example, Saul (later, Paul) is &ldquo;breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord&rdquo; when he is accosted by the Lord Himself. He comes in a &ldquo;light from heaven&rdquo; (compare with God&rsquo;s &ldquo;brightness&rdquo; from Psalm 18:12), yet his companions could not see Jesus (God made darkness His hiding place, v. 11). Saul&rsquo;s companions could hear His voice, just as David&rsquo;s enemies heard God as His voice thundered (v. 13).</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother interesting parallel to vs. 18:7-15 is found in Nahum 1. Here we learn that God is &ldquo;jealous, avenging, and wrathful&rdquo; against His adversaries; He reserves wrath for His enemies. This is why we are not to seek revenge, as the Lord says &ldquo;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY&rdquo; (Romans 12:19, Hebrews 10:30). Also, although God is quick to avenge, He is &ldquo;slow to anger&rdquo;, but because He is just, He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. Such punishment and wrath is compared to a fire, just as we see here in Psalm 18.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe should always keep in mind that there is nothing that happens to us that is outside of the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign control. Even when we are afflicted and attacked, God has a purpose in it. We may not know that purpose, but it is always for good. Consider Nahum 1:12-13, &ldquo;12Thus says the LORD, Though they are at full strength and likewise</p>\n<p>\n\tmany, Even so, they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no longer. 13\"So now, I will break his yoke bar from upon you, And I will tear off your shackles.&rdquo; It is God who afflicted Israel, and it is God who will deliver them.</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, Jesus will come again in the clouds, and will destroy all of His enemies with the word of His mouth. Again, this is not unlike what we read here in Psalm 18.</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 16-24 &ndash; &ldquo;16He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. 17He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me. 18They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the LORD was my stay. 19He brought me forth also into a broad place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me. 20The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me. 21For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not wickedly departed from my God. 22For all His ordinances were before me, And I did not put away His statutes from me. 23I was also blameless with Him, And I kept myself from my iniquity. 24Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps of all of Psalm 18, we see the Lord Jesus most clearly in this passage. Jesus was &ldquo;sent from on high&rdquo;, setting aside His very Deity, humbling Himself to become a man. Although crucified &ldquo;by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God&rdquo; (Acts 2:23), Jesus was ultimately delivered from the strong enemy, from those who hated Him, because God delighted in Him (Matthew 3:17). The resurrection testifies that God rewarded Jesus, as it were, &ldquo;according to my righteousness&rdquo;, and &ldquo;according to the cleanness&rdquo; of His hands. He who has sinned must die and stays dead; the sinless Lamb without blemish has overcome death. Only Christ has perfectly followed God&rsquo;s statutes, His Law. Only Christ has perfectly kept Himself from iniquity. Therefore, Christ was resurrected, and given His bride, the church. For those who believe in Him, God has delivered them from sin and death, from His wrath. Believers are delivered from the power of Satan (Ephesians 2:2), and are now sealed with the Holy Spirit. We are rewarded not because of our righteousness (Titus 3:5), but because of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness imputed to us.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile this passage applies prophetically to Messiah, it also applies to David, and therefore, to us as believers. God indeed delivered David from his strong enemy. &ldquo;Waters&rdquo; is often symbolic of trouble or death in Scripture (in Revelation 21:1 we&rsquo;re told there is no longer any sea in the new heaven and new earth). David appeared to be hemmed in by danger and destruction on every side, but God rescued him and put into a &ldquo;broad place&rdquo;, which refers to our freedom and liberty. Rather than being trapped by our enemies, we are free to move about as we please. Likewise, before we believe in Christ, Scripture tells us we are slaves to sin; we cannot change ourselves and are therefore &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; in a life of sin, under the power of the enemy. When faith in Christ is given to us, we are free. We now have liberty to obey God, and are empowered to do so by His Holy Spirit. We see this same thought in Psalm 31 (another Messianic Psalm), when</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid says, &ldquo;8And You have not given me over into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet in a large place.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat about David&rsquo;s comments regarding being rewarded according to &ldquo;his righteousness&rdquo; and &ldquo;the cleanness of his hands&rdquo;? Aren&rsquo;t we all unrighteous (except for Christ), as Scripture says (Romans 3:10)? Yes, we are all unrighteous, so unless we think Scripture contradicts itself (which it does not), then David cannot mean that he is perfectly righteous, nor does he mean he is sinless. Indeed, we see that David is not sinless (e.g., commits adultery with Bathsheba, then murders her husband Uriah). What David refers to here is that he has followed God&rsquo;s law before men. Charles Spurgeon comments on this as follows:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;David&#39;s early troubles arose from the wicked malice of envious Saul, who no doubt prosecuted his persecutions under cover of charges brought against the character of \"the man after God&#39;s own heart.\" These charges David declares to have been utterly false, and asserts that he possessed a grace-given righteousness which the Lord had graciously rewarded in defiance of all his calumniators. Before God the man after God&#39;s own heart was a humble sinner, but before his slanderers he could with unblushing face speak of the \"cleanness of his hands\" and the righteousness of his life. He knows little of the sanctifying power of divine grace who is not at the bar of human equity able to plead innocence. There is no self-righteousness in an honest man knowing that he is honest, nor even in his believing that God rewards him in providence because of his honesty, for such is often a most evident matter of fact; but it would be self-righteousness indeed if we transferred such thoughts from the region of providential government into the spiritual kingdom, for there grace reigns not only supreme but sole in the distribution of divine favours. It is not at all an opposition to the doctrine of salvation by grace, and no sort of evidence of a Pharisaic spirit, when a gracious man, having been slandered, stoutly maintains his integrity, and vigorously defends his character. A godly man has a clear conscience, and knows himself to be upright; is he to deny his own consciousness, and to despise the work of the Holy Ghost, by hypocritically making himself out to be worse than he is? A godly man prizes his integrity very highly, or else he would not be a godly man at all; is he to be called proud because he will not readily lose the jewel of a reputable character? A godly man can see that in divine providence uprightness and truth are in the long run sure to bring their own reward; may he not, when he sees that reward bestowed in his own case, praise the Lord for it? Yea rather, must he not show forth the faithfulness and goodness of his God? Read the cluster of expressions in this and the following verses as the song of a good conscience, after having safely outridden a storm of obloquy, persecution, and abuse, and there will be no fear of our upbraiding the writer as one who sets too high a price upon his own moral character.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 25-27 &ndash; &ldquo;25With the kind You show Yourself kind; With the blameless You show Yourself blameless; 26With the pure You show Yourself pure, And with the crooked You show Yourself astute. 27For You save an afflicted people, But haughty eyes You abase.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce again, we see characteristics of humanity that, elsewhere in Scripture (e.g., Romans 3), we are told no one possesses. Yet, for example, we also see that Job and Abraham were called blameless. Since Scripture cannot contradict itself, the only thing that makes sense is to understand this in an earthly sense. For example, the Hebrew word for blameless can mean &ldquo;without blemish&rdquo;, but it also can mean &ldquo;integrity&rdquo;. We do, in fact, speak this way of others. We&rsquo;ll refer to someone as being full of integrity, while at the same time realizing that all are sinners. So, when we see these descriptions, we need to view them from an earthly rather than spiritual perspective.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this passage, God shows how He deals with various kinds of people. In other words, how we deal with men is how God deals with us. This is similar to what our Lord tells us when teaching us how to pray: &ldquo;forgive us for our sins as we forgive those who have sinned against us&rdquo; (Matthew 6:12). To the kind or merciful, to the pure, to those with integrity, we reciprocate.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn verse 26, God likewise says He deals with the crooked the way they deal with others. The two words, crooked and astute, are different Hebrew words. Crooked means perverse, twisted. Astute means to twist, wrestle, or to be twisted. A similar passage is in Leviticus 26, where God lays out for the Israelites the blessings and curses of following or not following His Law. Regarding the curses, He says in vs. 23-24, &ldquo;And if by these things you are not turned to Me, but act with hostility against Me, then I will act with hostility against you; and I, even I, will strike you seven times for your sins.&rdquo; So, God disciplines those who act in crooked and perverse ways in ways that they behave. Note two important things here. First, God&rsquo;s desire is to turn the rebellious heart back to Him (as in Leviticus above: &ldquo;and if by these things you are not turned to Me...&rdquo;). Only if the response is one of hostility does God then exact vengeance. Even in our crookedness, God seeks reconciliation first. Second, we see here God&rsquo;s mercy and justice. Because His nature is holy, although He first shows mercy, ultimately, He will bring about justice, for a holy God always punishes sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome might see here a contradiction to Jesus&rsquo; command to love our enemies, because here we see God punishing His enemies. This isn&rsquo;t a contradiction, because while we are to show mercy, as well as love our enemies, Scripture specifically tells us to leave vengeance and wrath to God (Romans 12:19). We are to show love, mercy, kindness to all, and leave justice to God.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, David says God saves an afflicted people but brings down the haughty. Proverbs 3:34 puts it this way, &ldquo;Though He scoffs at scoffers, yet He gives grace to the afflicted.&rdquo; Afflicted means those who are poor, needy, humble, lowly, wretched. Does this not describe all humanity? And so it is that by grace, God is pleased to give salvation to those He chooses, never to those who deserve it, for no one deserves God&rsquo;s grace.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven those of us who have been saved can be afflicted, just as surely David was afflicted. This may seem to contradict the earlier verse that says God shows mercy, kindness and purity to those who demonstrate such behaviors, which believers should do. Yet there is no contradiction, for although we may be afflicted now, ultimately, God will save us. In the end, the afflicted are saved and the haughty, or arrogant, will be abased. As our Lord said in Matthew 23:12, &ldquo;Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.&rdquo; Indeed, this applies directly to our Lord, who humbled Himself by becoming a man and taking the punishment that was due to us. From this humility, He has been exalted above all things, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings. Since we are to be imitators of our Messiah, we, too, should humble ourselves, knowing that our affliction will ultimately be rewarded when we go to be with God.</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 28-29 &ndash; &ldquo;28For You light my lamp; The LORD my God illumines my darkness. 29For by You I can run upon a troop; And by my God I can leap over a wall.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we consider a lamp, it&rsquo;s a vessel for holding light, the purpose of which is to allow one to see, to overcome darkness. Obviously, lamp here is figurative. Scripture tells us, however, what is meant by a lamp. In Proverbs 20:27, we read &ldquo;The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, Searching all the innermost parts of his being.&rdquo; Our spirit is the vessel, so to speak, of the Lord when He indwells believers. It is God who gives our dark spirit light, for before we are saved, Proverbs 21:4 says, &ldquo;Haughty eyes and a proud heart, The lamp of the wicked, is sin.&rdquo; When God saves us, we are literally brought into His light, as 1 Peter 2 says, &ldquo;9But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God&#39;s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; 10for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tBy God&rsquo;s strength, David, a mighty warrior, is able to overcome an army. A wall, which was typically meant to keep people out of a city, is also no obstacle for David by God&rsquo;s power. So, too, it is with all believers. Only by God&rsquo;s power can we overcome the trials we face, the persecutions and the difficulties of life.</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 30-34 &ndash; &ldquo;30As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. 31For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God, 32The God who girds me with strength And makes my way blameless? 33He makes my feet like hinds&#39; feet, And sets me upon my high places. 34He trains my hands for battle, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider again vs. 21-23, where David speaks of God&rsquo;s ways, how he followed them, and how God then considered him blameless. Here, David speaks specifically of God&rsquo;s way, which refers to His course of life, or how He conducts Himself. His way is perfect, complete. When he says God&rsquo;s word is tried, it refers to it being tested and proven. It&rsquo;s like silver or gold that has been refined and has no impurities in it; it is perfect, and those who follow it perfectly are blameless.</p>\n<p>\n\tOver and over in Scripture, we read that God is a shield and refuge for the believer. He is our protector, and it is in Him alone that we find true safety. This passage is very similar to Proverbs 30: &ldquo;5Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. 6Do not add to His words Or He will reprove you, and you will be proved a liar.&rdquo; Throughout the church&rsquo;s history, there have been times when she has departed from God&rsquo;s word. We live in such a time today. The church is no longer content with God&rsquo;s word alone. People desire to have their ears tickled; they don&rsquo;t really want to dig deep into God&rsquo;s word. Instead, they want to be entertained, and have either added to God&rsquo;s word or departed from it completely. They do this for comfort, for finding out how to cope with life, how to be a good parent, how to have your best life now.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe irony is that God&rsquo;s word has been tested, proven that it works. It is only in Him and His word that one truly finds answers, protection, refuge. Yet today, the church only marginally preaches the Word. The church seeks to be &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; by being like the culture, and instead of changing the world into Christian disciples, the church becomes like the world. Once again, God&rsquo;s word is proven true, and men are proved to be liars.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust as in our day, in David&rsquo;s time, men made their own gods. David makes clear that there is no God other than Jehovah, the one true and living God. To take refuge or have confidence in any other god is foolishness, but all unbelievers do not seek God nor honor Him as God. As Romans 1 says, &ldquo;21For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.&rdquo; But no one will find help in a false god, for only God is our rock. Ultimately, our Rock is Christ, who provides spiritual refuge for all who believe in Him.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid ends this passage with a description of how God surrounds and binds (girds) him with strength. Note David&rsquo;s complete dependence on God, and how this makes David&rsquo;s way like God&rsquo;s way: blameless. When we trust in the Lord (His promises, His word) and do not lean on our own understanding, we are made strong in Him. In our weakness, God&rsquo;s power is made perfect (2 Corinthians 12:9, 13:4). Remember, David began the Psalm with cries for help. God not only answered, but He answered in His power. Having feet like hinds feet refers to a deer, or a wild mountain goat, whose feet have no problem in rocky, difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a picture of David conquering mountain strongholds of his enemies. Despite being hemmed in on all sides by his enemies, God puts David in an open and spacious place of strength and safety (high places). Finally, note that it is God who trains David&rsquo;s hands for battle; He is the one who provides the supernatural ability and strength that made David a great warrior. Are we to take it literally that David could bend a bow of bronze? I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s very possible. We have the example of Samson, who was also given supernatural strength by the Lord. While God may not give us supernatural strength, the point is that we can accomplish all things by God&rsquo;s power. As the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.&rdquo; (Philippians 4:13)</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 35-36 &ndash; &ldquo;35You have also given me the shield of Your salvation, And Your right hand upholds me; And Your gentleness makes me great. 36You enlarge my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tBy shield of salvation, David here means God&rsquo;s protection and deliverance, saving David out of many physical battles. Calvin says it well: &ldquo;if God had not wonderfully preserved him, he would have been exposed unprotected to many deadly wounds; and thus God&rsquo;s shield of salvation is tacitly opposed to all the coverings and armor with which he had been provided.&rdquo; Spiritually speaking, this could refer to the commandment for believers to put on the full armor of God, which includes &ldquo;the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.&rdquo; (Ephesians 6:16) By &ldquo;right hand&rdquo; is meant that God is on David&rsquo;s side. To stand on someone&rsquo;s right hand side is to aid that person. It could also be a reference to the Lord Jesus, who sits at the right hand of God.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe word &ldquo;gentleness&rdquo; means &ldquo;humility, meekness&rdquo;. At first glance, this seems a somewhat strange statement; how does God being humble make us great? Upon reflection, however, if we understand that God stoops low to make us &ldquo;great&rdquo;, then humility makes sense. Consider that the all powerful Creator of the universe would, out of love, be so humble as to make His creatures great. No doubt, this is personified in the Lord Jesus Christ, as Philippians 2 says, &ldquo;5Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, 6who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, 7but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond- servant, and being made in the likeness of men. 8Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. 9For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name.&rdquo; Truly, Jesus&rsquo; humility for our sake has made us &ldquo;great&rdquo;!</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, the Lord created a wide space in which David could walk. Having had to hide from his enemies in caves and mountains, having to travel along rocky paths, God makes a clear and wide path for David. His footsteps are sure, and his feet will not slip. When God&rsquo;s ways are followed, He provides smooth paths (although they are not always without troubles). Psalm 37:31 says, &ldquo;The law of his God is in his heart; His steps do not slip.&rdquo; Likewise, Psalm 121:2 says, &ldquo;My help comes from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth. 3He will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber.&rdquo; A slipping foot typically refers to calamity that&rsquo;s about to befall sinners, as in Deuteronomy 32 (which, by the way, is the text for Jonathan Edwards&rsquo; famous sermon, &ldquo;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&rdquo;):</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;35&#39;Vengeance is Mine, and retribution, In due time their foot will slip; For the day of their calamity is near, And the impending things are hastening upon them.&#39; 36\"For the LORD will vindicate His people, And will have compassion on His servants, When He sees that their strength is gone, And there is none remaining, bond or free. 37\"And He will say, &#39;Where are their gods, The rock in which they sought refuge? 38&#39;Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let</p>\n<p>\n\tthem rise up and help you, Let them be your hiding place! 39&#39;See now that I, I am He, And there is no god besides Me; It is I who put to death and give life I have wounded and it is I who heal, And there is no one who can deliver from My hand.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tNote the similarity to this Psalm. God is the only true God; He vindicates His people, punishes His enemies, wounds and heals. Similarly, believers in Christ are given sure footing. The ultimate calamity, death, has no power over us, for there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). Although the sting of sin is death, 1 Corinthians 15:55 says, &ldquo;O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?&rdquo; Christ has truly provided the ultimate victory.</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 37-42 &ndash; &ldquo;37I pursued my enemies and overtook them, And I did not turn back until they were consumed. 38I shattered them, so that they were not able to rise; They fell under my feet. 39For You have girded me with strength for battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. 40You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, And I destroyed those who hated me. 41They cried for help, but there was none to save, Even to the LORD, but He did not answer them. 42Then I beat them fine as the dust before the wind; I emptied them out as the mire of the streets.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tClothed with the power of God, David is able to utterly destroy the enemies who, at the beginning of the Psalm, looked as though they were ready to kill him. Previously in distress as his enemies were closing in on him, David now pursues his enemies; they flee from him. Notice how completely his enemies are destroyed: they are consumed (annihilated, cease to exist); subdued (made to bow down); they turn their backs (as they run in fear); they are destroyed (annihilated, exterminated); they were beat as fine as dust (pulverized); they were emptied as mire (like mud poured out). Though God&rsquo;s enemies called, there was none to save; and the Lord did not answer. Those who reject the true and living God are not honored with an answer; He rejects them (1 Samuel 8:18; Proverbs 1:23-29; Micah 3:4).</p>\n<p>\n\tThis passage also prefigures what Christ will do to His enemies when He comes again (Revelation 19:20-21; 20:9-10). Because He humbled Himself, God exalted Him: &ldquo;9For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, 10so that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE WILL BOW, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&rdquo; (Philippians 2) Just as David&rsquo;s enemies were made to bow down, everyone will bow down before the great and glorious Lord Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 43-45 &ndash; &ldquo;43You have delivered me from the contentions of the people; You have placed me as head of the nations; A people whom I have not known serve me. 44As soon as they hear, they obey me; Foreigners submit to me. 45Foreigners fade away, And come trembling out of their fortresses.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid faced confrontation both from within and without Israel. Yet, again, God delivered him from his enemies. Not only did the Lord restore Israel, delivering them from the nations that often ruled over them, but He also gave those nations into David&rsquo;s hands. They submit to David at the sound of his voice, having heard of his success as a warrior who was empowered by God.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce again, this is a passage that refers to Christ. As we saw earlier, all will bend the knee to the Lord Jesus Christ. He will rule over all nations; His enemies will be His footstool. Better yet, many nations (which refers to Gentiles) will be made Christ&rsquo;s servants when they hear the gospel. It is by hearing that faith comes (Romans 10:17), and it is by faith that we are obedient. Once they hear, they believe; once they believe, they obey. All who are &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; could refer to those who are do not believe, in which case they will no longer exist (&ldquo;fade away&rdquo;). Alternatively, it could mean there will be no foreigners because those who hear will believe, and all unbelievers will eventually fade away. This should give us confidence and boldness to preach the gospel, knowing that the Lord will build His church, and we can participate in helping Him build it.</p>\n<p>\n\tVerses 46-50 &ndash; &ldquo;46The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation, 47The God who executes vengeance for me, And subdues peoples under me. 48He delivers me from my enemies; Surely You lift me above those who rise up against me; You rescue me from the violent man. 49Therefore I will give thanks to You among the nations, O LORD, And I will sing praises to Your name. 50He gives great deliverance to His king, And shows lovingkindness to His anointed, To David and his descendants forever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid closes this Psalm with praise to God. Saying the Lord &ldquo;lives&rdquo; can be seen as an oath (similar to those God gives when He swears by Himself that He will do what He says He would do), that as surely as God lives He will certainly protect His own and execute vengeance for His children. It can also be seen as true that He lives by the evidence of what He has done for David, as He said He would. Because of this, He is exalted for providing protection, salvation, and deliverance.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile David appropriately again gives God credit for executing vengeance for him, Calvin rightly points out that David becomes the very instrument that God uses to exact His vengeance. This is because David is on the throne, and, as such, holds the authority to use the sword, an authority God has ordained that governments should have. As Calvin says,</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;David, therefore, has put the word vengeance for the just punishments which it was lawful for him to inflict by the commandment of God, provided he was led under the influence of a zeal duly regulated by the Holy Spirit, and not under the influence of the impetuosity of the flesh. Unless this moderation is exemplified in performing the duties of their calling, it is in vain for kings to boast that God has committed to them the charge of taking vengeance; seeing it is not less unwarrantable for a man</p>\n<p>\n\tto abuse, according to his own fancy and the lust of the flesh, the sword which he is allowed to use, than to seize it without the command of God.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause of what God has done for him, David gives thanks among the very nations (Gentiles) he rules over. Paul refers to this passage in Romans 15:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;8For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises given to the fathers, 9and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, \"THEREFORE I WILL GIVE PRAISE TO YOU AMONG THE GENTILES, AND I WILL SING TO YOUR NAME.\" 10Again he says, \"REJOICE, O GENTILES, WITH HIS PEOPLE.\" 11And again, \"PRAISE THE LORD ALL YOU GENTILES, AND LET ALL THE PEOPLES PRAISE HIM.\" 12Again Isaiah says, \"THERE SHALL COME THE ROOT OF JESSE, AND HE WHO ARISES TO RULE OVER THE GENTILES, IN HIM SHALL THE GENTILES HOPE.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat a beautiful picture David is here as a type of Christ! Surely, Christ expounded this verse to His two disciples on the road to Emmaus. As Paul reveals by the Holy Spirit to us, this passage in Psalm 18 clearly refers to Christ. Knowing that God has shown us Gentiles mercy, let us praise and glorify God in all that we do.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid finishes his song of praise with yet another praise for God&rsquo;s deliverance. While this applies specifically to David, it also is Messianic, and therefore, prophetic. The words &ldquo;great salvation&rdquo; refer to a magnified deliverance. In fact, the word for salvation is &ldquo;yeshua&rdquo;, which is the Hebrew name for our Lord. In Christ, God shows His lovingkindness (checed), which means His grace, favor, mercy. This word indicates that it is constant and abiding, meaning God&rsquo;s grace and mercy never departs from Christ and His church. The reference to David and his descendants also refers to Christ, as Revelation 22:16 says, &ldquo;I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tTo summarize, this great song of praise not only applied to David in a literal and even physical sense, but it also clearly prophetically applies to Christ. From this application, there is much comfort we can receive.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>Ladies, this one is for you. The hype of the Valentine&rsquo;s Day season usually ends with all the disappointment of real life compared to a romance novel. In light of that, maybe this will be a balm to your wounds.</p>\n\n<p>Do you remember how it was to be about 16 years old? Maybe that was the official &ldquo;car-date&rdquo; age for you as it was for me. Leading up to this monumental freedom was a period of time where your girlfriends were your all in all. There was nothing better than time with your best-friends, (besties or BFFs in today&rsquo;s language). You giggled and laughed. You shared deep-dark secrets and swore to never tell (and didn&rsquo;t, imagine that). You cried about the mean girls and exchanged everything from socks to hairstyles. There was nothing you didn&rsquo;t know about each other and you knew that nothing would ever separate you. Then came car-dating.</p>\n\n<p>Remember how it was? From across the class room, or basketball court, or chess-board (OK probably not), you saw him. He glanced at you. Your knees turned to jelly and your heart was set ablaze. You could think of nothing else, talk of nothing else, and your besties were kind enough to indulge your fantasies of true love. Then he asked you to go to the movies and the romance began. Remember what else happened? You dropped your friends like a handful of hot rocks.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/swisscake.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 15px; width: 200px; height: 132px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Yep. We all did it. Even if we didn&rsquo;t intend to do it, the focus of our lives shifted from lip-gloss to lip locks. And let&rsquo;s face it ladies, lip locks win out every time. Yeah, we probably felt some remorse, and when our beloved was not around, we longed for a good heart-to-heart with our best girl friends, but we were willing to make the sacrifice for true love. My point? Well, it might take some explaining so bear with me.</p>\n\n<p>When I was about seven and a half months pregnant, I ate an entire box of Little Debbie Swiss Rolls. The entire box. In one sitting. That&rsquo;s 6 twin packs, or (count &lsquo;em) 12 Swiss Rolls. I ate them sitting in my car in front of the Target store where I had stopped to buy&hellip;you guessed it, Little Debbie Swiss Rolls. I could blame the episode on pregnancy, but truthfully that would just be an excuse to cover up what was really going on. I was scared. I was unbelievably insecure in my ability to be a good mother (And stuffing twelve Swiss Rolls through to my unborn son was a great start, don&rsquo;t you think?).</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to have a complete emotional flip-out, but needed, for the sake of my own sanity, to cram those fears and insecurities down as far as I could get them so that I could remain in control. Twelve Swiss Rolls did the trick, and in the way all best friends do, they soothed my tears, patted my back, stroked my hair, and whispered reassuring words to me as I cried in the dark.</p>\n\n<p>You may not have the same best friends that I do (and I have more than one, because I am very popular in this regard) but I bet you have a handful of your own. As women, we tend to be drawn to friends like say, romance novels, dishing-the-dirt, and shopping. Maybe your best friends include sleep that comes from a pill or a bottle, TV, exercise, or compulsive work. Maybe your best friend is your great big house and all your pretty dishes, or the fancy car you drive. I don&rsquo;t know your best friends, but I certainly know my own. I love them. They make me feel good. They make me feel safe, and accepted, and loved. They give me security and identity and a sense of power. They will be my Best Friends Forever!</p>\n\n<p>Until I fall in love. I don&rsquo;t mean settling for a car date with my BFF in the back seat. Christ, my beloved, is coming for me! He is riding on His white horse and His name is &ldquo;Faithful&rdquo; and &ldquo;True&rdquo;. His eyes are blazing with fire, and He has come to take His bride to the banquet. Be still my heart!! Be quiet my besties!! I don&rsquo;t need you anymore, for my True Love has come. He will never leave me or forsake me. He draws my eyes away from everything that has been His shabby substitute. He has captured my heart, my mind, my soul. He leaves no room for thoughts of others, leaves no open invitation to other friends.</p>\n\n<p>He completely satisfies me with His great romance. He will never leave me with a sugar headache and guilt (or an extra two pounds). He will never leave me trying to find a new anesthesia. He will never leave me alone with my friends crowding around clamoring for attention, demanding I descend from my &ldquo;high&rdquo; so that they can build me back up. &ldquo;Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 13:7-8a)</p>\n\n<p>Oh wait! That&rsquo;s my best friend&rsquo;s ring tone&hellip;I gotta get&hellip; &ldquo;How beautiful you are my darling! Oh, how beautiful!&rdquo; (Song of Solomon 4:1)&hellip;never mind, I&rsquo;ll call her back later. Maybe. Now what was that you were saying, my love?</p>\n\n<p>Like I said ladies&hellip;a handful of hot rocks!&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tOn August 3rd the Merriam-Webster Word of the Day was levigate. They provided this definition:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>1 : polish, smooth<br />\n\t2 (a) : to grind to a fine smooth powder while in moist condition<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) : to separate (fine powder) from coarser material by suspending in a liquid</em></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\tPolish</h3>\n<p>\n\tThe idea of polishing brought to mind the thought of a mirror. Mirrors are polished to make the reflection clearer and more accurate. We were created in the image of G-d to reflect His glory (Genesis 1:26-27). It seems as though He polishes our lives and removes the dust and smudges to make us better reflect who He is. The very first mention of mirrors in Scripture is found in Exodus 38:8 when Moshe is making the furniture for the tabernacle:</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, he made the laver of bronze with its base of bronze, from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the doorway of the tent of meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe midieval French commentator Rashi provides some explanation:</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the difficult times of the Egyptian bondage the Israelite men separated from their wives. They believed it was improper to bring children into a world of suffering. Their wives disagreed. They faithfully believed that G-d would soon bring an end to their suffering. It was best in their opinion to have children and preserve the continuity of the Israelite people. They used these mirrors to beautify themselves before their husbands in an attempt to persuade them to have children. Their arguments and actions prevailed and they succeeded in raising a new generation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs instruments of faith these mirrors were incorporated into the order of worship that G-d ordained for His people. Whenever the priests would bend over to wash their hands and their feet during their service in the temple, they would see the reflection of the sky and be reminded of the One Who is over all mankind. They were also reminded of the great faith of their ancestresses and encouraged to walk in that great degree of faith (2 Cor 5:7).</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\tSmooth</h3>\n<p>\n\tThis word brought to mind a passage from Luke.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Luke 3:3-6:</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>And he [John] came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins; as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, &ldquo;THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, &lsquo;MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT. &lsquo;EVERY RAVINE WILL BE FILLED, AND EVERY MOUNTAIN AND HILL WILL BE BROUGHT LOW; THE CROOKED WILL BECOME STRAIGHT, AND THE ROUGH ROADS SMOOTH; AND ALL FLESH WILL SEE THE SALVATION OF GOD.&rsquo;&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>\n\tIf this passage were spoken in Hebrew or Aramaic then the concluding phrase would be &ldquo;AND ALL FLESH WILL SEE THE YESHUA OF G-D&rdquo;. It is a play on words&hellip;a pun. &ldquo;Yeshua&rdquo; is the Hebrew name that G-d gave to Jesus in Matthew 1:21. Yeshua means &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; in Hebrew. John is quoting from the Septuagint and declaring that all humanity will see the Yeshua of G-d.</p>\n<p>\n\tMay that day spoken of in Isaiah 45:23 when &ldquo;every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear&rdquo; come to pass speedily and in our days. Amen.&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tIn 1994, several well-known Christians signed a document with leaders of the Roman Catholic Church (RCC) called &ldquo;Evangelicals and Catholics Together,\" or ECT for short. Much has been written about this unholy union that does not need repeating here, but one of the motivations for ECT was that the RCC agrees with Christians on many &ldquo;moral&rdquo; issues (e.g., abortion, homosexuality, etc.).</p>\n<p>\n\tTogether, the signers of the document reasoned, we can be a united force to shape American society, to make it more &ldquo;moral;\" together, we can have a greater voice in these discussions. The RCC, as she plows down the slippery slope of ecumenism, actively seeks such unions, and increasingly, so do some Christian denominations. On the surface, we might ask what&#39;s wrong with such a union? After all, shouldn&rsquo;t Christians seek to influence the morality of society? Implicitly (and sometimes explicitly, as we will see), these unions have a larger political agenda than meets the eye.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is in this context that I want to make Christians aware of a sermon that was recently preached by a United Methodist, Dr. William J. Abraham, entitled, &ldquo;Striving for Holiness and Peace in a World of Abortions.\" This sermon was reproduced in the newsletter Lifewatch &ndash; Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality (for those wishing to read the entire sermon in context, you may do so here). This is a pro-life organization, one that actively supports the RCC due to their similar stance on abortion. What caught my eye were a few statements made by Dr. Abraham, which I quote below:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Second, we sally forth in the company of our brothers and sisters in other faiths. Of course, there will be differences between, say, Christians, Jews, and Moslems. Here we need to be theologically clear, if controversial. Contrary to what is commonly said, Christians, Jews, and Moslems believe in the same God.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>We all believe in one and only one Creator of the universe. And we all believe that human agents are precious creatures that come from the hand of God. Such claims are not a matter of political expediency. They are a matter of conceptual fact. Of course, Christians, Jews, and Moslems differ radically. We disagree on the content of divine revelation. We disagree on what God has done for the salvation of the world. And we disagree on how to articulate how God is best understood doctrinally. </em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>However, these differences should in no way undermine the crucial theological point that Christians, Jews, and Moslems share a common, if minimal, vision of God and human agents. It would be theologically wrong-headed and politically imprudent to ignore this. On the issue of life and abortion, we can work in peace together with other robust theists in our midst.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tClearly, Dr. Abraham believes it is politically prudent to work with those of other faiths. While that may or may not be true, the real question for us as Christians is should we join with other faiths simply to make society a better, more &ldquo;moral\" place. I believe we will see more and more of this kind of thinking leak into &ldquo;mainline&rdquo; Christian denominations.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider this: Dr. Abraham is the Albert Cook Outler Professor of Wesley Studies at the Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University. He is a prominent professor at a mainline Christian seminary teaching soon-to-be pastors. Certainly, he is not the first seminary professor to teach false theology, and he certainly won&rsquo;t be the last, but an increasing number of professing Christians are willing to become yoked together with those who do not believe in the Biblical gospel of Jesus Christ for the sake of &ldquo;morality.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile we may assume their intentions are good (and even acknowledging that American society continues to decay at an alarming rate), is joining hands with those who do not believe the Gospel truly the best way for Christians to reverse America&#39;s moral decay?</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, let&#39;s consider some of Dr. Abraham&rsquo;s statements in light of Scripture:</p>\n<h3>\n\tAre Jews and Moslems Brothers and Sisters with Christians?</h3>\n<p>\n\tDr. Abraham makes clear he believes people of other faiths are &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; to Christians. This implies that we are of the same family, and therefore, we have the same Father. Are we brothers and sisters with Jews, Moslems, Jehovah Witnesses, Roman Catholics, etc.? To answer this, let&#39;s turn to the Scriptures.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Bible says all people are sinners (Romans 3:23), but more importantly we are told that all men prior to faith in Christ are not God&rsquo;s children; instead, they are called children of the devil:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others.&rdquo; (Ephesians 2:1-3)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you want to do.&rdquo; (John 8:44)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said, &ldquo;You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right!&rdquo; (Acts 13:9-10)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tClearly, all people, prior to faith in Christ, are not God&rsquo;s children. The good news for those who believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior is we are born again, born into a new family, the family of God. Believers (and only believers) are God&rsquo;s children, born of the Spirit and not of the flesh; only those who are born again are Christians. The Bible makes this clear.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; (John 1:12-13)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;Now this he did not say on his own authority; but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.&rdquo; (John 11:51-52)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs&mdash;heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.&rdquo; (Romans 8:15-17)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;But it is not that the word of God has taken no effect. For they are not all Israel who are of Israel, nor are they all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, &ldquo;In Isaac your seed shall be called.&rdquo; That is, those who are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted as the seed.&rdquo; (Romans 9:6-8)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.&rdquo; (1 John 3:1-3)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God. In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.&rdquo; (1 John 3:8-10)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tConsequently, Dr. Abraham is wrong. Christians are not brothers and sisters with those of &ldquo;other faiths.\"</p>\n<h3>\n\tDo Christians, Jews and Moslems Believe in the Same God?</h3>\n<p>\n\tDr. Abraham calls the answer to this question &ldquo;a matter of conceptual fact.\" Keeping in mind that Dr. Abraham teaches future church leaders, is he correct about his \"facts?\" Again, let&rsquo;s look to Scripture and reason to see if this is so.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore Christians, Jews and Moslems can claim to believe in the same God, they would first need to agree on Who God is and where that knowledge is found. As Christians, our source for this revelation is Scripture. On the other hand, the Muslim worshipper find his divine revelation in the Qur&#39;an. The Bible itself teaches that there is no other source of revelation concerning the true God except that which came from the Jews and Jesus Himself. Obviously, Christians believe this and reject the Qu&#39;ran, which which came hundreds of years later and without divine inspiration nor authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf Muslims and Christians receive their revelation concerning the Person of the Diety from different, mutually exclusive sources, then it is not \"factual\" to say Muslims and Christians believe in the same God, since we know the Muslim god is a false one found in the Qur&rsquo;an while the Christian God is the true Deity revealed in His own words through the writers of the Bible.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, the Bible and the Qur&rsquo;an contradict each other in many ways, which would innevitably create confusion if we were to believe they are both inspired by the same God. Yet the Scripture says, &ldquo;For God is not the author of confusion but of peace.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 14:33)</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, the Bible reveals that God is found in the person of Jesus Christ; Jesus is God in the flesh. Anyone who rejects Jesus as God also rejects God entire. We see this clearly in several verses:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;He who hears you hears Me, he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.&rdquo; (Luke 10:16)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;He who believes in Me, believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me. And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.&rdquo; (John 12:44-45)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son. And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.&rdquo; (1 John 5:10-11)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son, that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.&rdquo; (John 5:22-23)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tBoth Jews and Muslims reject Jesus as God, therefore they reject Who He said He is. If Scripture tells us that Jesus is God and that to reject Him is to reject the Father (i.e., God), then it is impossible to conclude that Jews and Muslims believe in the same God as Christians. Obviously, the professor&rsquo;s statement is not &ldquo;conceptual fact.\" It is no fact at all.</p>\n<h3>\n\tDo Christians, Jews and Moslems Share a Common View of God and Humanity?</h3>\n<p>\n\tDr. Abraham states that it is a &ldquo;crucial theological point that Christians, Jews, and Moslems share a common, if minimal, vision of God and human agents.&rdquo; To this list, I would add (following Dr. Abraham&rsquo;s logic) Jehovah Witnesses, Roman Catholics, and any other &ldquo;faith&rdquo; that believes in one God but presents a false gospel. Is Dr. Abraham correct to say that these faiths share a common view? Once again, this is not logically possible if we reason out of the Scriptures.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristians believe that man is sinful and cannot, in and by himself, do anything to be reconciled to a holy God, yet all of the above groups believe that man not only can but must do something to be reconciled to God. Christians believe that it is God who does it all through Christ&#39;s work and that we are reconciled to God only through faith in His Son. Our works count for nothing!</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Christian view of salvation through faith and apart from works is hardly the &ldquo;common&rdquo; view among these religions. In fact, the view of God offered by Dr. Abraham is of a god created in his own image, and that is the ultimate outcome of ecumenism &ndash; bible idolatry.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you can see from the above Scriptures, Christians are not brothers and sisters to followers of these other faiths, nor do we worship the same God they worship, nor do we share even a common view of God them. So the question remains: should Christians join hands with religions that do not believe in the gospel? Scripture again provides the answer:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) and find out what pleases the Lord. Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.&rdquo; (Ephesians 5:8-11)</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>&ldquo;Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness? And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: &ldquo;I will dwell in them And walk among them. I will be their God, And they shall be My people.&rdquo; Therefore &ldquo;Come out from among them And be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, And I will receive you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will be a Father to you, And you shall be My sons and daughters, Says the Lord Almighty.&rdquo; (2 Corinthians 6:14-18)</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we join hands with those who are enemies of the gospel, we legitimize their false religion and bring disgrace to our Lord. We put &ldquo;moral&rdquo; issues on a higher plane than the gospel itself, and therefore, than Jesus. This is not to say these issues aren&rsquo;t important nor that we shouldn&#39;t be active in our own way on certain issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tNonetheless, let us all be bold in sharing our faith, in presenting the words of life to those who are in other faiths or of no faith at all knowing that we were once just like them. The certain way to true revival and a more &ldquo;moral&rdquo; society is one in which there are more Christians, children of the living God. May God forgive us for not sharing the gospel as we should, and may He be merciful to our country and bring a true revival.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>No doubt, though, we will continue to see the lines between religions blur as the way is paved for the antichrist. THough the world desires &ldquo;unity,\" idolatrous people create gods in their own image and teach a lie to be truth. Our Lord warned us about the false teachers that would arise: &ldquo;Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.&rdquo; (Matthew 7:15) </em></p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, in Acts 20:28-30, Paul through the Holy Spirit says:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which He bought with His own blood. I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock. Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.&rdquo; </em></p>\n<p>\n\tBut all of this simply means our Lord&rsquo;s coming is nearer still. \"Even so, come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; (Revelation 22:20)&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>My son&rsquo;s toilet overflowed the other day.</p>\n\n<p>As I was running to grab the old towels, I slipped and fell right into the middle of the mess. Do you ever find yourself in the middle of a mess, looking around wondering how you ended up sitting there with wet sweats and soggy slippers?</p>\n\n<p>In my case, the mess was caused by my son&#39;s backed-up toilet, and I feared the obstruction was pretty serious judging by the roll-sized clumps of toilet paper lying in soggy piles all around me - not to mention what may have gone before the paper. Ugh!</p>\n\n<p>While considering the probably cause of the toilet&#39;s overflow, I was struck by a sense of irony, because this incident came on the heels of recent argument I had with my husband. Leave it to the Lord and His wisdom to arrest me using such vivid imagery! Surrounded by toilet water, I was indisputably in the right place to receive His lesson.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus said in Matthew 12:34 that \"out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks.\" Well, the illustration of that truth was certainly becoming clearer from my vantage point on the floor. I was forced to recognize that the overflow of my heart had been equally unpleasant as the one I was now sitting in.</p>\n\n<p>The source of my foul overflow was a violation of Ephesians 4:26-27 which instructs:</p>\n\n<p><em>In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.</em></p>\n\n<p>I had been given ample opportunity prior to our argument to \"flush\" my anger away, but I waited too long. By the time the next opportunity came along, a \"clog\" had accumulated in my heart causing an overflow of epic (or should I say septic?) proportions.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking through His word in Proverbs 29:8 and again in 29:11, God reminded me that a wise man turns away anger, and a fool gives vent to it. Verse 22 of the same Proverb says, &ldquo;An angry man stirs up dissension, and a hot-tempered one commits many sins.&rdquo; Ecclesiastes 7:9 says it too: &ldquo;Anger resides in the laps of fools.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>OK. I think I got that. Stirring and venting are off the list.</p>\n\n<p>Anger was in my lap, alright, and when you ignore God&#39;s instruction to get \"un-angry\" before you see the sun set, you&rsquo;ve set the stage for a big, nasty mess.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus offers a simple way to keep the pipes clear in Matthew 18:15:</p>\n\n<p><em>If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over...</em></p>\n\n<p>Alternately, if we remember that a brother has something against us, we should go to him and make that right too (i.e., Matthew 5:23-24) - and we should do it before the sun sets.</p>\n\n<p>As I mopped up the mess in my son&#39;s bathroom, gagging on the smell, I had a new appreciation of the stench of my own sin from God&rsquo;s perspective. I took a minute to thank Him, again, for the grace of Christ and the mercy He shows me when my mess overflows.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I was faced with the clean-up of the aftermath my mess created. That&rsquo;s the inevitable product of our sin: a mess. And you can&rsquo;t wade around in it pretending it&rsquo;s not sloshing over your boots.</p>\n\n<p>Our bathroom is clean once again, and my 12-year-old has been reminded of proper paper practices. It&rsquo;s time for me to go clear my own pipes.</p>\n\n<p>Right after I take another shower.&nbsp;</p>"

She and her little boys were coming in from school, and as they entered the kitchen through the garage, she happened to glance into the family room and notice the absence of their flat screen TV, its cords dangling from the wall outlet. In the wake of that split second where she examined the possibilities and landed on the truth, she grabbed her boys and fled.</p>\n\n<p>You can flee a scene like that but it never really leaves you. It is a violation of the most personal sort; a violence to your peace. When you study the etymology of the words violate and violence you find at their root the idea of impetuous, irreverent injury that has the effect of irreparable harm. As I have prayed for her and her family I&rsquo;ve begun to realize that most of us have been burglarized in ways we may not even understand. We have suffered the violence of impetuous, irreverent, irreparable injury.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/13_04_65_web.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 15px; width: 200px; height: 300px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Have you ever left the house of a morning feeling fine and blessed and happy only to get on the road in front of a guy in a giant gas-hogging SUV who would apparently like to ride to work with you via your trunk? By the time he careens around you at break-neck speed he&rsquo;s left you with nothing but dangling cords where your feelings of well-being were concerned.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever taken special time and effort to dress up for a date with your spouse, only to have your teenaged daughter quip, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wearing THAT?!&rdquo; Or arrived at work feeling pretty good about having gotten there at all considering how many breakfasts and lunches you just made, permission slips you signed, last minute homework you reviewed, and carpool lines you sat in, only to discover that you&rsquo;re wearing two different colored shoes (because you were interrupted 14 times while trying to decide)? Yep. You&rsquo;ve been robbed of your confidence and left with a giant gaping hole of self-doubt and humiliation.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe today you had a &ldquo;near-miss&rdquo; in your car or at the Doctor&rsquo;s office that has stolen your sense of security and left fear and uncertainty in its place. Maybe someone having a bad day themselves has cheated you of kindness with a sharp word instead. Maybe a boss has deprived you of recognition for your hard work and loyalty. It&rsquo;s the little things that give us a common understanding of the feeling of violence. You have your own stories of violent loss at the hands of someone with impetuous irreverence for what was stolen from you. Those common stories make us kindred spirits with my friend who was left with nothing but dangling cords.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe as we all consider this today it will cause us to think carefully about our words and deeds. Hopefully it will increase the value we have for those things we take from others without a thought &ndash; things like confidence, hope, encouragement, self-satisfaction, and happiness. In this world, such things are tenuous and treasured. If we could insure them for their replacement value we certainly would. But I can steal them from you without a care, walk away, and never know that I too have left you with dangling cords.&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t<strong>Words for thought</strong>: The Merriam-Webster Word of the Day for July 27th was verbatim. This was their definition: in the exact words; word for word.</p>\n<p>\n\tAn interesting anecdote came to mind when I saw this word. Some friends went to Israel on a mission trip to visit the Holy Land and to evangelize there. While they were there they attempted to teach a group of a dozen Hebrew youths the game of \"telephone.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tTelephone is a game where a line of children whisper a phrase from one person to the next. Each person must repeat the phrase exactly as they heard it spoken by the previous person. Obviously, mistakes and distortions are introduced along the chain as the phrase is heard and then repeated. By the time the phrase reaches the last person on the chain, it will have changed substantially from the original. The object of the game is to show how gossip results in distortions and inaccuracies.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the telephone game was explained to the Hebrew children, they were confused at first: the children couldn&#39;t understand the point of the exercise.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs they finished playing a round of the game, an amazing thing happened. The child at the end of the line repeated exactly the same phrase that had started the game with the first child. For obvious reasons, my missionary friends were startled by the perfect result, so they decided to make the children play another round of the game. Yet again, the phrase was repeated perfectly through the entire line of children.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat these Western missionaries experienced was a distinction between Hebraic eastern culture and American western culture. In Hebraic culture it is considered honorable to quote someone exactly. As a result, children are usually trained to quote others with a degree of precision unimaginable to most Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is part of the cultural heritage of the Hebrew people. So, when unbelievers claim that Scripture was transmitted by word of mouth for centuries before it was written down and therefore must be corrupted over time, I share two things with them:</p>\n<p>\n\t1. Exodus 24:3-4 and Deuteronomy 31:9 which make the point that Moshe wrote down the words of Scripture.<br />\n\t2. This anecdote that illustrates that for millennia exact repetition has been a hallmark of Hebrew culture and society, not only in speaking but in writing as well.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>Early on in my Christian life I was blessed to study in Joshua 4 how God led His people into the Promised Land (finally!). God gets a \"do-over\" with this generation, since most all the faithless generation before them died while they were wandering...and wandering. When this new generation reaches the Jordan River, they discover it&rsquo;s at flood stage, so God must part the water to allow the nation to cross over on dry ground. That&rsquo;s something these children hadn&rsquo;t seen during the first go-round at the Red Sea.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what history records in Joshua 4:1-3:</p>\n\n<p><em>Now when all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying, \"Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe, and command them, saying, &#39;Take up for yourselves twelve stones from here out of the middle of the Jordan, from the place where the priests&#39; feet are standing firm, and carry them over with you and lay them down in the lodging place where you will lodge tonight.&#39;\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Why, you ask? The answer comes in Joshua 4:6-7:</p>\n\n<p><em>Let this be a sign among you, so that when your children ask later, saying, \"What do these stones mean to you?\" then you shall say to them,\"Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.\" So these stones shall become a memorial to the sons of Israel forever.</em></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Stones-49630.jpeg\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px 10px 0px; width: 350px; height: 219px; float: left;\" />I don&rsquo;t like navel gazing. You know - the pastime of pure self-examination. Asking what happened to me in the past and how that baggage will hang around me forever is just not a productive activity for me, so when I first began to consider the Lord&rsquo;s command to take up those stones, I was as stubborn as Balaam&rsquo;s donkey! I thought He was telling them (and me) to remember all the fruitless years of wandering in the desert made necessary by someone else&rsquo;s sin.</p>\n\n<p>No way was I interested in remembering my personal desert wandering. In fact, my favorite verse in the Bible is Philippians 3:13-14:</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>But as the Lord began to deal with me, I saw more here than I had at first.</p>\n\n<p>This account in Joshua is such a cool story and you should read the whole thing, but one important concept to get here is this: the priests were standing in the middle of the river bed holding the Ark of the Covenant - the mercy seat from where atonement was made every year for the sins of the people. The Ark and its Mercy Seat are also pictures of Christ&#39;s saving work, and the people took stones from under the Ark and built them up on the bank of the river to be stones of remembrance.</p>\n\n<p>The gist of this to me was that I should look back on my life and see what I could take from \"under Christ\" as a remembrance of His faithfulness to me. Think about it: the priests were standing firm on dry ground with water piled up around them as the people hurried across! That&rsquo;s a picture of how God acts on behalf of His people, and it&#39;s His faithfulness He wants remembered. How He cutoff the waters of the Jordan is worth remembering!</p>\n\n<p>My faith has been - and I suspect will always be - one that demands a demonstration. Don&rsquo;t just tell me what I&rsquo;m supposed to do; show me what that looks like in my reality. If I can&rsquo;t use something to get through my day, it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything more to me than trivia. Now I like trivia, but I can&rsquo;t find the meaning of life in it.</p>\n\n<p>So, to help this story mean something useful in my life, I sat down and began to recall all the ways God acted faithfully to me and to my family. I discovered that I had quite a list. I wondered how I could create stones of remembrance and share these things with my then 7-year-old son without eliciting eye-rolling boredom. It occurred to me I should do just what God said to do (imagine that!).</p>\n\n<p>So, one rainy afternoon I took a bucket and collected stones from a river bed not far from my house. I wrote an example of God&rsquo;s faithfulness to my family on each stone, and then I piled them all in a big glass jar and placed it next to my kitchen sink. Guess what happened? My son arrived home from school that afternoon and asked, &ldquo;What are those rocks for, mom?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Now I ask you, how faithful is our God?</p>\n\n<p><em>Samuel then took a large stone and placed it between the towns of Mizpah and Jeshanah. He named it Ebenezer &ndash; the stone of help &ndash; for he said, \"Up to this point, the LORD has helped us!\" - 1 Samuel 7:12&nbsp;</em></p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tThe Merriam-Webster Word of the Day for July 27th was quaff. They provided this definition: to drink deeply.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the definition they provided this:</p>\n<p>\n\tNowadays, \"quaff\" has an old-fashioned, literary sound to it. For more contemporary words that suggest drinking a lot of something, especially in big gulps and in large quantity, you might try \"drain,\" \"pound,\" or \"slug.\" If you are a daintier drinker, you might say that you prefer to \"sip,\" \"imbibe\" or \"partake in\" the beverage of your choice. \"Quaff\" is by no means the oldest of these terms &mdash; earliest evidence of it in use is from the early 1500s, whereas \"sip\" dates to the 14th century &mdash; but it is the only one with the mysterious \"origin unknown\" etymology.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/3manna.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: right; width: 300px; height: 377px; \" /></p>\n<p>\n\tThis brings to mind a passage of Scripture taken from John 4:10-14:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Jesus answered and said to her, \"If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, &#39;Give Me a drink,&#39; you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.\" She said to Him, \"Sir, You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep; where then do You get that living water? You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle?\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\tJesus answered and said to her, \"Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is indeed a beverage worthy of a deep drink!</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother passage also came to mind from John 6:48-59:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread also which I will give for the life of the world is My flesh.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying, \"How can this man give us His flesh to eat?\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>So Jesus said to them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him. As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also will live because of Me. This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever.\" These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tCatholicism would have us believe (contrary to G-d&#39;s declaration that both blood and human flesh are unsuitable for consumption- Leviticus 11, Deuteronomy 14, Acts 10:14) that the bread and wine of the Lord&#39;s Supper is transformed into human flesh and blood. Messiah was definitely not expecting the Jews in Capernaum to start cannibalizing Him. So what then was He saying?</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the context of the passage Messiah was talking about manna that was given to the Isra&#39;elites when they left Egypt. It should come as no shock to anyone that Yeshua was not the original \"Gingerbread Man\" and was not actually made of bread. He was using a metaphor to illustrate His point: just as physical manna fell from heaven and provided physical sustenance to the Isra&#39;elites, so also the spiritual manna (Yeshua) came from heaven to provide spiritual sustenance to the Isra&#39;elites.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider the context of the words He has already spoken to them after the crowd finds him on the other side of the sea (John 6:25):</p>\n<p>\n\t- This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent. - John 6:29<br />\n\t- Believe in Messiah - John 6:35-40<br />\n\t- Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me. - John 6:45<br />\n\t- Whoever believes has eternal life - John 6:47</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Jewish literature the concept of \"eating the bread from heaven\" is a metaphor for the daily study and application of Scripture to a person&#39;s life. In other writings like the Babylonian Talmud (in tractate Sanhedrin 98b, 99a), we find references to \"eating [the messiah] in the days of Hezekiah,\" which is an idiom for \"they enjoyed his blessings.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tThe First Fruits of Zion ministry makes this observation that we are:</p>\n<p>\n\t\"...more acquainted with the metaphor of eating and drinking than we sometimes allow; we &#39;devour&#39; books, &#39;drink in&#39; a lecture, &#39;swallow&#39; a story...&#39;ruminate&#39; on an idea or poem...\"</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>May we quaff the drink that Messiah offers to us and eat of the food that He ate: \"My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work.\" - John 4:34&nbsp;</em></p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>I live in a semi-rural area. What I mean by that is that my house is built in a subdivision, which was formerly a cow pasture and is still surrounded by farm land that has not been sold off piece by piece to encroaching developers. The whole county is made up of this patchwork of growth and resistance. It makes for a weird amalgam of city and country which appeals to my somewhat schizophrenic nature.</p>\n\n<p>On the way home from my errands today I drove by a particularly idyllic pasture which sits at the foot of the local spillway. As the pasture fence and the road merged and ran side by side for a bit, I noticed one big black cow bent down on its forelegs, rear end in the air, with its head stuck sideways through the barbed-wire fence trying vainly to reach a tiny patch of green grass just beyond its grasp. It was awkward and embarrassing.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/930660427_ab76c3de6a.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 15px; width: 250px; height: 165px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now isn&rsquo;t that just like me,\" I thought. See, I had just come from errands, but also from a new thrift store that had opened nearby, where I bought four sweaters that I do not need. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that I paid less than $10 total for all four (I know, right?), I don&rsquo;t need them.</p>\n\n<p>And as I compared myself to the cow (not for the first time) I realized that the problem is really even bigger than buying sweaters that I don&rsquo;t need. It extends to every area of my life.</p>\n\n<p>I am not content.</p>\n\n<p>I am not content with what I have or who I am. I am not content with my current level of success or visibility. I am not content to serve in one particular area but seem to flit about and never land. I am not content with my number of friends or my social status, the car I drive, my hair, my purse, my shoes, my nose&hellip;I am not content.<br />\n<br />\nThe writer of Hebrews says:</p>\n\n<p>Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, \"Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.\" (Hebrews 13:5 NIV)</p>\n\n<p>Begging the Lord&rsquo;s pardon, I would add that we should keep our lives free of the love of anything which interferes with being content in the Lord. He will never leave us nor forsake us, and so we should, and can, be content with His presence and His provision.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the whole scenario calls to mind another story where two people living in a beautiful garden with everything they could ever want or need, including the presence of the Lord Himself, decided they wanted just a little bit more. They took from the tree what was not given to them. Everything but that fruit had been given freely, but it was that fruit they wanted. They were not content with anything less than all they could see.</p>\n\n<p>Now here is where I&rsquo;m tempted to speak for the whole human race, but must be content (pun intended) to speak for myself alone. I am constantly reaching for more, bigger, better, faster, newer, cooler, and adjective on end, just something&hellip;else. Constantly straining for, reaching for, and taking what has not been given. I&rsquo;m in debt to the bank and in debt to the devil because I&rsquo;ve reached beyond the Lord&rsquo;s provision. Look at who the \"giver\" is in the verse below:</p>\n\n<p>\"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. (Acts 17:24-25)</p>\n\n<p>God made the world and everything in it. It is all His to give, or not. Did you notice what it said He gives &ldquo;life and breath and everything else?\" I think that might include four new sweaters&hellip;when I need them. That&rsquo;s the rub and the struggle that Jesus speaks to in this verse:</p>\n\n<p>So do not worry, saying, &#39;What shall we eat?&#39; or &#39;What shall we drink?&#39; or &#39;What shall we wear?&#39; For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. (Matthew 6:31-33)</p>\n\n<p>Why do I run after what I do not need, when I have a God who owns the cattle on a thousand hills and everything else? It is only when I lose sight of the abundance of the kingdom and the joys set before me that I become discontent and begin to act like a cow with its rear end on display, head in the barbed wire fence, reaching for what is always just beyond my grasp when there is a field of abundance beneath me!</p>\n\n<p>I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. Philippians 4:12</p>"

Messiah gives us words of warning in Matthew 24:9:</p>\n<p>\n\tThen they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd words of comfort in John 16:33:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Paul gives us words of encouragement in Romans 5:3-5:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance; and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope; and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tJohn tells us of himself in Revelation 1:9:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tIf you feel that you are under attack and are suffering tribulation because of your faith in the Messiah, Yeshua, then know that you are in the company of many faith-filled men of Scripture and in the company of Messiah Himself.

I&rsquo;ve never met this young man or his wife, but have taken an instant liking to them both because of their faith stories, our common bond in the Spirit, and in particular, his sense of humor. He&rsquo;s a witty young man who has gifted to me a wonderful metaphor.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/BooOutOfWindow.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px 10px 0px; width: 350px; height: 263px; float: left;\" /></p>\n\n<p>In a recent email he wrote, &ldquo;I&#39;ve mentioned to a few of you that I feel like a dog in a car. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re going to the park or to the vet, but I know God&#39;s driving, so it&#39;s going to be OK. Right now, it just feels more and more like we are heading to the vet.&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t that the best?! He&rsquo;s caught between uncertainty and a sense of anticipation; it&#39;s enough to make him pace between windows in the back seat!</p>\n\n<p>Aren&rsquo;t we all there with him? I know if you stop to picture this you can imagine yourself there too. It&rsquo;s the story of our faith! One day the Master grabbed the leash and headed for the driveway. Our hopes rose! We grabbed our ball and jumped in the backseat. With our nose pressed against the glass as it slowly descended, we waited for that first tantalizing scent carried by the breeze.</p>\n\n<p>Then it occurred to us! Maybe we aren&rsquo;t going to the park! Maybe&hellip;we&rsquo;re&hellip;going to&hellip;the VET! But&hellip;maybe not! Maybe we&rsquo;re going to the park. And the ensuing inner struggle begins. We know that the park is in our future, eventually, but maybe it comes only on the other side of the Vet. It makes me think of this exchange between Peter and our Lord:</p>\n\n<p><em>&ldquo;I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.\" Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, \"Follow me!\" - John 21:18-19</em></p>\n\n<p>Did you catch that last part? Follow me - with an exclamation point! Can&rsquo;t you just see it? He&rsquo;s already been to the Vet, and He knows we&rsquo;re headed there too. But now He&rsquo;s got His ball and He&rsquo;s at a dead run, ears back, leash trailing behind, eyes squinted in bliss. The park is worth it! &ldquo;Follow Me!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, give us strength each day to endure the Vets of life, to always be looking forward to the joy that is before us and to follow you to the park! Until then we&rsquo;ll just hang our heads out the window, put our noses in the air and let the breeze take our tongues!</p>\n\n<p><em>Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. - Hebrews 12:1-3</em></p>\n\n<p>In memory of Tacha Palmgren who went to the park on October 27, 2009, after having been at the Vet for a very long time. And for Jeff, who is still there. Take heart&hellip;the park is just around the bend!&nbsp;</p>"

I&rsquo;ll get to that in a minute.</p>\n\n<p>First let me tell you that it has been my very great privilege over the past couple of weeks to reconnect with an old friend. I have been dumbfounded by the way God has orchestrated this reunion at the perfect time, and how He has drawn my friend toward Him, and how He positioned me &ndash; the worst of sinners &ndash; to be able to speak a word of encouragement to her, to tell her about God&rsquo;s promises and the wonder of walking with Him.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/1flag-shadow-box.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 15px; width: 351px; height: 235px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>As my friend and I have conversed, one of my main concerns has been to paint a realistic picture of what it means to give your life to Christ. I don&rsquo;t want it to be a deceptively rosy picture of ease and comfort that would be contrary to the Word. There is a violence in our salvation that can not be denied. To pick up your cross and follow Him is no small thing - enter my DJ&rsquo;s story.</p>\n\n<p>The DJ on my radio told a story of how he had been in a doctor&rsquo;s office waiting room with an older man, who had served in the Navy for 20 years (hats off!). The man confessed to the DJ that he didn&rsquo;t really like his time in the service, but nudging the DJ with his elbow he said with a grin, &ldquo;But the retirement is great.\"</p>\n\n<p>It is, isn&rsquo;t it? For us I mean. Just as this man didn&rsquo;t always like the work he did defending what he believed in, we don&rsquo;t always enjoy what is required of us in order to bear the name &ldquo;little Christ.\" God never promised that it would be easy or that we would always like the path He leads us down, but the retirement is beyond description.</p>\n\n<p>Consider these Biblical contrasts:</p>\n\n<p>John 16:33 says: &ldquo;In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Matthew 5:11-12 says: \"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Matthew 19:29 says: &ldquo;And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Those are just a few. And then consider these nuggets:</p>\n\n<p>Revelation 20:11: &ldquo;Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Revelation 21:1- 4: &ldquo;I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, &#39;Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.&#39;\"</p>\n\n<p>Revelation 21:23-25: &ldquo;The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>As I talk with my friend about what it means to surrender to God, these are the things I want her to know. It&rsquo;s a long hard walk in the mud up to your ankles, but the rewards are so much more than your service can earn. There are days when you&rsquo;ll wonder what exactly you signed up for (and if you don&rsquo;t have those days you might want to check your walk to see if it has wandered).</p>\n\n<p>Some days feel like you&rsquo;re in boot camp with no end in sight. It takes all your effort to maintain the posture, to run the next mile, to slug through the slough, to not just lie down and give up. On those days you can remember our soldier friend and what he discovered about his retirement package - and then remember your own. No more death. No more crying, no reason to. A hundred times as much reward as what it cost us. God with us &ndash; Emmanuel &ndash; in the flesh. Light, glorious light, and no more darkness.</p>\n\n<p>So, I&rsquo;ve gotten preachy as I tend to do when the promises of scripture take over. One more thought. What was the last great hurt you felt? When were you recently disappointed? Did your bones ache when you got up this morning? Do the mundane tasks of your day seem pointless or beyond your ability to manage? Are you feeling unloved, unappreciated, unworthy, useless? The promises of God tell you that it will all be over soon and what you have waiting on the other side of this life is the antithesis to all that in a degree that can&rsquo;t be measured. That&rsquo;s enough for me to take one more step and shout &lsquo;oorah&rsquo;!</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade-kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by God&#39;s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.&rdquo; 1 Peter 1:3-6</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For in just a very little while, \"He who is coming will come and will not delay.&rdquo; Hebrews 10:37</p>\n\n<p>Hallelujah! Keep your gold watch; I have a better retirement package!</p>\n\n<p>(Dedicated to the memory of all our &lsquo;retired&rsquo; heroes who paid the ultimate price for our lives and way of life.) &nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tThe Merriam-Webster word of the day for Friday May 22nd was carrefour. They provided this definition:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>1 : crossroads<br />\n\t2 : square, plaza</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe following etymological information was also provided:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>An interesting thing about &ldquo;carrefour&rdquo; is that even though the second half of the word contains the number &ldquo;four,&rdquo; it is actually the first half of the word that derives from the Latin word for &ldquo;four.&rdquo; &ldquo;Carrefour&rdquo; derives via Middle French from Late Latin &ldquo;quadrifurcus,&rdquo; an adjective meaning &ldquo;having four forks,&rdquo; formed by combining Latin &ldquo;quadri-&rdquo; (&rdquo;four&rdquo;) and &ldquo;furca&rdquo; (&rdquo;fork&rdquo;). &ldquo;Carrefour&rdquo; has been a part of the English language since the 15th century. It once referred to an intersection of four roads at a single point, but later came to refer to any public square or plaza. &ldquo;Carfax,&rdquo; a similar word that also derives from &ldquo;quadrifurcus,&rdquo; can be found in some British place names, such as the primary intersection in the city of Oxford, England.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis brings to mind the stories in Scripture about men being left in the square without a place to stay.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first such story is found in Genesis 19:1-13 with the story of the angels that entered into Sodom and met Lot. The angels indicated they would stay in the square but Lot begged them to come and stay with him. Later that evening the men of the city surrounded Lot&rsquo;s house and called for Lot to send out the men so they could have &ldquo;relations with them&rdquo; as the NASB phrases it. Lot stood firm and called for the men of Sodom not to act wickedly.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe find an eerily similar story in the book of Judges 19 where a man of the tribe of Levi stopped and stayed in the town of Gibeah. In verse 22 and later another group of men from the city came and asked for the man to be given to them so they could &ldquo;have relations&rdquo; with him.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough the sin involved in both situations was one of homosexuality and sodomy it was not for this specific sin that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. Ezekiel 16:49-50 tells us</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>&ldquo;Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy.&nbsp;Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them when I saw it.\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe specific sin mentioned here is the sin of failing to help the poor and needy. It is a reflection of the hearts of the men of those cities that they did not fear G-d and take care of the poor and needy (including the angels of Lot&rsquo;s day) among them. This heart attitude led them into additional sins that included the abomination (Lev 18:22) of homosexuality. As verse 50 notes &ldquo;Thus [as a result/consequence] they were haughty and committed abominations before Me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tTo G-d be the glory and power and honor forever. Amen.</p>\n"

                 "body": "<h4>\n\t<em>&ldquo;Houston, we have a problem...&rdquo;</em></h4>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tI have been reluctant in the past to join the ongoing debate within Christian circles on the merits and drawbacks of megachurches. It&rsquo;s not that I lack an opinion on the subject; as you will see from this article, I have given considerable thought to the phenomenon and its effect on the church. My concern has been that I would make the same mistake so many others have made before me: throwing out the good with the bad. In our rush to highlight the significant problems associated with the megachurch movement, we risk treating every large congregation as automatically bad and every small congregation as inherently good.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe truth is good and bad churches come in all sizes, and in fact, small churches are still dominant in America. Over 50% of the churches in the United States claim less than 100 regular attendees, and only 6% of U.S. churches count over 1,000 weekly attendance (Hartford Seminary, 2000). Still, the trend is for ever larger churches, with studies showing that the number of people attending church has been rising in recent years even as the total number of churches in existence has been declining.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, I&rsquo;ll begin with a disclaimer: not all large churches are bad, and not all small churches are good. All churches should be evaluated on their own merits using scripture as our guide. This essay examines a phenomenon commonly associated with large churches, but it could be true of small churches as well.</p>\n<h4>\n\t<br />\n\tReason #1: &nbsp;Big church brings big expense</h4>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIt&rsquo;s hard to imagine a church thriving and growing without a permanent building &ndash; but that&rsquo;s exactly what the early Christian church did. In fact, the early church existed for several hundred years before the idea of the church owning its own property took hold. As reflected in the second chapter of Acts, the early believers met in homes and in public places, like the the temple. Obviously, smaller gatherings could met virtually anywhere, while larger groups needed the larger public spaces of the temple or the &ldquo;large room&rdquo; highlighted in Acts 20.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt took the marriage of the church to the state under Constantine in the 4th century to establish the association between a congregation and its church building. Today, churches are largely defined by their building, and while no one can argue with the need for a suitable meeting place, when does a building become more of a liability than an asset to a church?</p>\n<p>\n\tIn an &ldquo;average&rdquo; megachurch today (i.e., churches consisting of 2,000+ weekly attendance), the costs associated with operating and maintaining a large physical plant are staggering. For example, the monthly utility bill at any one of these churches is often more than the annual budget of most smaller churches. When we factor in the cost of staff salaries, insurance, equipment, building funds, maintenance, office supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses, megachurches can consume tens of millions of dollars annually merely serving the needs of a few thousands worshippers.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat&rsquo;s wrong with a congregation spending so much on itself? Simply put, the church doesn&rsquo;t exist for its own sake. The church is Christ&rsquo;s bride, the light and salt of the earth, the caretaker of the less fortunate, the carrier of the Gospel to the nations. Therefore, its priority ought to be on reaching those outside the church walls rather than lavishing its wealth on those who meet inside. Megachurches bring to their ministries unparalleled resources, yet they are equally great consumers of resources.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsequently, for all their wealth and prominence, the megachurches&rsquo; impact for Christ in the world is disproportionately small. One statistic says it all: in most megachurches today, the advertising &amp; media budget usually dwarfs the budget for missions and outreach.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat if instead of concentrating so many resources in a single megachurch, we distributed those same resources among two dozen small churches? Since the overhead of a smaller church tends to be lower per capita than the overhead to operate a megachurch, fewer megachurches and more small churches would lead (at least theoretically) to more resources available for the work of the ministry outside the walls of our church buildings. Of course, smaller churches aren&rsquo;t necessarily more effective than larger churches in spreading the gospel, but at least they aren&rsquo;t shackled by an all-consuming appetite for resources.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>(Continue to <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/the_megachurch_phenomenon_part_2/\">Part 2</a></strong>...)&nbsp;</em></p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tMany Christians realize that Jesus was not born on December 25th, as many theologians place the likely time of Christ&rsquo;s birth sometime between March and May. In fact, the early church didn&#39;t celebrate Jesus&rsquo; birthday, or at least there is no historical mention of it being observed as a special or holy day.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, how did December 25th become the day we celebrate Jesus&rsquo; birth? The leaders of the church in Rome, seeking to supplant the pagan holiday of Saturnalia (a multi-day, licentious celebration that culminated on December 25th), decided to designate the last day as the day of Jesus&rsquo; birth. The tradition was instituted in early fourth century after Constantine came to power.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the holiday&#39;s questionable roots, Christians today understand that we observe December 25th to celebrates Jesus&rsquo; birth, <img alt=\"The real meaning of Christmas\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/santa_as_satan.gif\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px; float: right; width: 200px; height: 278px;\" />God becoming a man bringing redemption to all who believe. The question I want to address here, however, is whether Christians should lead their children to believe in Santa Claus as part of their celebration of Christmas. Is he part of the <strong>real meaning of Christmas</strong>?</p>\n<p>\n\tSanta has become an integral part of most Christmas traditions, and it seems harmless enough. The story of Santa Claus ties together many elements that have since become treasured parts of our celebration like gift-giving, Christmas trees, flying reindeer, elves making toys, the North Pole, etc. We all probably share many good memories of such traditions from our youth, so how can Santa be a bad thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, remember Scripture&rsquo;s warning in 2Cor 11:14-15:</p>\n<p>\n\tNo wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile this verse refers to false apostles within the Church, it can also be understood as a model for the way Satan and his servants (i.e., the demons) will work in other situations as well. For example, injecting a mythical character who brings gifts to good children into a celebration focused on Christ&#39;s birth seems like the kind of tactic an \"angel of light\" might employ to remove our focus off Christ and create a competitor for our affections.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis strategy is especially effective against young believers (or potential believers), at the very time they are so impressionable. Who needs a Christ Child...we have Santa!</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, what should we make of the way parents encourage their children to believe what is essentially a lie? Under any other circumstances, we would condemn Christian parents (or any parents) who intentionally lied to their children for many years about something important, all the while knowing their child must eventually learn the truth. Unfortunately, when it comes to Santa many have come to believe that such a deception is acceptable and even preferrable. Aren&#39;t we teaching our kids not to trust us?</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead, we should be teaching our children to love the truth, not to accept lying. Ephesians 4:17-25 puts it this way:</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, 18being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another.</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps the most important reason we should not lie to our children about Santa is that we lose an opportunity to help them stand apart from the world in their Christian witness. Instead, instruct them in Christ, and they can be a witness to their friends explaining to them the real meaning of Christmas. Rather than becoming like the world, the Lord says:</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect - Romans 12:2</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, 1Peter 1:14-16 says:</p>\n<p>\n\tAs obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, \"YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, I offer a personal reason for telling your kids the truth, based on my own experience. I still remember the day when I finally told my first daughter that Santa Claus wasn&rsquo;t real. She was approaching the age when most kids already know the truth, so on theis day when she said something that caused me to think she had figured out that Santa wasn&#39;t real, I took the opportunity to confirm that there was no Santa Claus.</p>\n<p>\n\tMuch to my surprise (and shock), she started crying. She hadn&#39;t known the truth after all, and I felt awful for crushing her belief so carelessly! I will remember this moment for the rest of my life, yet I continued to lie to my second daughter about Santa, still thinking it was the best thing to do. As a result, I endured a repeat of this emotional scene with her a few years later.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese experiences occured prior to (or just after I began) my Christian walk, so my wife an I were making decisions based on what the world taught us was best. While I&rsquo;m not saying that the Bible specifically prohibits us from including Santa Claus in our Christmas traditions, I do hope I&rsquo;ve shown how telling the truth is a better way and a better witness, which is the way I believe Scripture guides us.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know that if I had to do it over again, I wouldn&#39;t lie to my kids about Santa. Just as our holy Father in heaven has graciously bestowed His truth on us, let us be parents worthy of our Christian calling. In so doing, we and our children can show that Christ is indeed what the real meaning of Christmas is all about.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Does it seem, especially in the U.S., that our morals have eroded to the point that we almost have no shame?</p>\n<p>\n\tMore specifically, it seems there is an all-out assault on the sanctity of life (e.g., abortion, end of life assisted suicides), marriage (e.g., the push for gay marriage), and religious freedom (e.g., increasing attacks on the Christian faith).</p>\n<p>\n\tIn an effort to create a unified push back against the secular culture, on November 20, 2009, a document entitled The Manhattan <img alt=\"Secular Trends: Lipstick on a Pigs\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/lipstick-on-a-pig.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 15px; float: right; width: 290px; height: 380px;\" />Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience was released. The declaration was signed by a number of prominent Christian leaders, names you will likely recognize.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe group&#39;s goal was to join together in defense of the specific areas of life, marriage, and religious liberty. The paper presents strong, reasoned arguments against society&rsquo;s current views of these issues, encourages Christians to speak out against the <strong>secular trend,</strong> and to not obey any laws that would cause us to go against what God has revealed about these issues. In a nutshell, the declaration states:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"Because we honor justice and the common good, we will not comply with any edict that purports to compel our institutions to participate in abortions, embryo-destructive research, assisted suicide and euthanasia, or any other anti-life act; nor will we bend to any rule purporting to force us to bless immoral sexual partnerships, treat them as marriages or the equivalent, or refrain from proclaiming the truth, as we know it, about morality and immorality and marriage and the family. We will fully and ungrudgingly render to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s. But under no circumstances will we render to Caesar what is God&rsquo;s.\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAlmost all Christians would likely agree with this declaration. However, I have a problem with it. If you&rsquo;ve read it, you might say, &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s not to like here?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not the issues per se, it&rsquo;s the fact that the declaration was jointly signed by Orthodox, Catholic and Evangelical Christians.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Yeah, so what?\" you may be wondering. Well, the problem is the signers joined together to fight the secular decline of our culture, and admirably stated their reasons for doing so. Therein lies my problem, and I hope yours too.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe signers all identified themselves as Christians. In fact, they state:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"We, as Orthodox, Catholic, and Evangelical Christians, have gathered, beginning in New York on September 28, 2009, to make the following declaration, which we sign as individuals, not on behalf of our organizations, but speaking to and from our communities.\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, they go on to say:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"We are Christians who have joined together across historic lines of ecclesial differences to affirm our right &mdash; and, more importantly, to embrace our obligation &mdash; to speak and act in defense of these truths. We pledge to each other, and to our fellow believers, that no power on earth, be it cultural or political, will intimidate us into silence or acquiescence. It is our duty to proclaim the Gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in its fullness, both in season and out of season. May God help us not to fail in that duty.\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem is the signers have said they are all Christians. While they acknowledge their differences, these differences are made to be simply &ldquo;historic lines of ecclesial differences.\" Yet, despite these implicitly differences, they say it is their duty to proclaim the gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. This is the heart of the matter: the Gospel.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Reformation was all about the Gospel. Through the reformers (i.e., Protestants, as they came to be known), God restored the Biblical gospel. The reformers and &ldquo;Evangelical&rdquo; [although this term does not necessarily mean what it used to] Christians proclaim a gospel that is different than that of the Catholic church. So, when the declaration says it&rsquo;s their duty to proclaim the gospel, it begs the question which gospel?</p>\n<p>\n\tMore importantly, should we as Christians, who proclaim the true gospel, join together as brothers and sisters in Christ with those who proclaim a different false gospel? As always, we need to look to God&rsquo;s word for the answer. First however, it will be useful to know how Christians define the gospel compared to the Catholic definition.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere has always been only one Gospel. While a discussion of how the gospel became corrupted is beyond my purpose here, suffice it to say that over time the Biblical gospel was changed. In general, the Catholic church (the only church in existence at the time, apart from the separation of the Orthodox church in 1054) turned the gospel from one of salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, to one of grace through faith plus works. Indeed, the church itself became necessary for salvation as only the church could administer the sacraments that were also supposedly necessary for one to be saved.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Scripture, we see that God always keeps a remnant. Despite the Gospel being corrupted, God always had a remnant of true believers who denied the corrupted Gospel. There were plenty of people who believed the true Gospel, even before the issue came to a head in the early 1500s when Martin Luther kicked off the Reformation. The Reformation brought about another church split, one based primarily on the gospel.</p>\n<p>\n\t(As a side note, I truly believe there are many people in the Catholic church today who are Christians. By definition, however, these believers cannot adhere to the official teachings of the Catholic church, since official Catholic doctrine is contrary to the Gospel. This means believing Catholics are also \"bad\" Catholics, as they violate official Catholic teaching. Historically, Catholics who come to know and follow the true Gospel have always been persecuted and even killed for their contrary views, which is how the Reformation started.)</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the Council of Trent (which culminated in 1564 and was the official Catholic response to the Reformation), the Catholic church officially and &ldquo;infallibly&rdquo; denied the Biblical gospel. Some of the key canons from that council include the following:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>THE COUNCIL OF TRENT, SIXTH SESSION</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>CANON XI</strong>.-If any one saith, that men are justified, either by the sole imputation of the justice of Christ, or by the sole remission of sins, to the exclusion of the grace and the charity which is poured forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inherent in them; or even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the favour of God; let him be anathema.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>CANON XII</strong>.-If any one saith, that justifying faith is nothing else but confidence in the divine mercy which remits sins for Christ&#39;s sake; or, that this confidence alone is that whereby we are justified; let him be anathema.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>CANON XX</strong>.-If any one saith, that the man who is justified and how perfect soever, is not bound to observe the commandments of God and of the Church, but only to believe; as if indeed the Gospel were a bare and absolute promise of eternal life, without the condition of observing the commandments ; let him be anathema.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>CANON XXIV</strong>.-If any one saith, that the justice received is not preserved and also increased before God through good works; but that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of Justification obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof; let him be anathema.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>CANON XXVI</strong>.-If any one saith, that the just ought not, for their good works done in God, to expect and hope for an eternal recompense from God, through His mercy and the merit of Jesus Christ, if so be that they persevere to the end in well doing and in keeping the divine commandments; let him be anathema.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>CANON XXX</strong>.-If any one saith, that, after the grace of Justification has been received, to every penitent sinner the guilt is remitted, and the debt of eternal punishment is blotted out in such wise, that there remains not any debt of temporal punishment to be discharged either in this world, or in the next in Purgatory, before the entrance to the kingdom of heaven can be opened (to him); let him be anathema.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>CANON XXXII</strong>.-If any one saith, that the good works of one that is justified are in such manner the gifts of God, as that they are not also the good merits of him that is justified; or, that the said justified, by the good works which he performs through the grace of God and the merit of Jesus Christ, whose living member he is, does not truly merit increase of grace, eternal life, and the attainment of that eternal life,-if so be, however, that he depart in grace,-and also an increase of glory; let him be anathema.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tLike Scripture, the Catholic church teaches that salvation is by grace through faith, and that one must become righteous in order to be saved. Unlike Scripture, the Catholic church teaches that a person must become inherently righteous through good works (works done by God&rsquo;s grace); that is to say, the person becomes righteous in and of himself.</p>\n<p>\n\tStated another way, the righteousness a person has is truly his own righteousness rather than Christ&#39;s righteousness imputed to him. This is what they mean by salvation being conditional upon one&rsquo;s obedience to the commandments (Canon XX), and that the justice received by faith is preserved and increased through good works (Canon XXIV), and that good works merit the increase of grace, eternal life, and the attainment of that eternal life (Canon XXXII). There are other unbiblical things required for one to be saved according to the Catholic church, but these alone clearly teach another gospel.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, this should bother every single Christian reading this. Why? Because the true Gospel says that we are counted righteous by the imputation of Jesus&rsquo; righteousness (see Romans 4 in particular). Since no one can ever perfectly obey all of God&rsquo;s commandments, we need a sinless Savior Who can, and that is exactly what Jesus did for us. Just as we were made sinners by Adam&rsquo;s transgression, we were made righteous by Jesus&rsquo; obedience. Romans 5:12 states it this way:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned--</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Romans 5:18-19:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. For as through the one man&#39;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe difference between the Catholic gospel and the true, Biblical Gospel is strikingly clear. We are made righteous not by our obedience (whether by God&rsquo;s grace or not). Rather, we are made righteous by Jesus&rsquo; obedience, and this righteousness is imputed or credited to the believer through faith. Anything added to this Gospel is another gospel.</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving compared the true, Biblical Gospel with the Catholic gospel, we can now look at what God&rsquo;s word says about Christians joining with those who proclaim a different gospel, as the signers of the Manhattan Declaration did. Perhaps the clearest discussion of this is found in Galatians.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this epistle, Paul is writing to the Galatians in response to the Judaizers who have crept into the Galatian church and were preaching another gospel. Specifically, the Judaizers were saying that to be saved, one had to believe in Jesus by faith, but they also needed to become circumcised, and even obey the Law. In chapter 1:6-9, we read Paul&rsquo;s response:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; which is really not another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed! As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWhat gospel did the Galatians receive? The same one Paul gave to the Romans, as quoted above. Read Galatians 3, which makes this even more clear. What of those who preach another gospel? Paul says they are to be &ldquo;accursed.\" This is about as serious as you can get, for accursed means to be divinely condemned. Therefore, because the Catholic church preaches another gospel, Paul would say they are accursed. Clearly, we are to have no part (as \"brethren&rdquo;) with those who preach another gospel.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to the &ldquo;other&rdquo; gospel the Galatians received (i.e., follow the Law,) in chapter 5:2-6 Paul says:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you. And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law. You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tNote that the Catholic church says the same thing, that salvation is conditional upon obedience to the commandments (Canon XX). Thus, following the Catholic gospel, according to Paul, will sever you from Christ, because that gospel teaches that one must be justified by works, by obeying the commandment to seek inherent righteousness.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul feels so strongly about the true Gospel that he makes one of the harshest criticisms in the Bible. In Galatians 5:12, speaking about those preaching circumcision, Paul says in 3:12:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I wish that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Greek word for mutilate means to literally cut off, to castrate; think about a male dog being neutered. Ouch!</p>\n<p>\n\tScripture further tells us in 2Corinthians 6:14-15:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness? Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?</em></p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, while we can certainly agree on the issues in the Manhattan Declaration, in no way should we join with those who preach another gospel in such a declaration. It would have been much better for Christians to have signed this declaration separately and let the Catholics sign it on their own. They could have united on a common moral belief while keeping separate their theological views.</p>\n<p>\n\tThankfully, a few leading Christians have come forward recently and denounced the joint signing of the Manhattan Declaration, including John MacArthur, R.C. Sproul, Alistair Begg, and James White, to name a few. They essentially make the same point I am making here. I am thankful for these bold voices reminding Christians that the Gospel is what matters the most. We can&rsquo;t sacrifice our theology for the sake of ecumenical morality. Theology does indeed matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the declaration may make a few good points, by itself it will be completely ineffective in changing unbelievers&rsquo; hearts. We can make public stands, perhaps even becoming salt and light to the world through our words and deeds, but it will never prompt faith apart from the Word fo God and power of the Spirit. In fact, if this approach produces any societal benefit through a change in behavior and thought among unbelievers, it amounts to nothing more than lipstick on a pig.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy our efforts the world may look better on the outside, but on the inside there has been no real change. This is what Jesus meant when He called the Pharisees &ldquo;whitewashed tombs.\" That&rsquo;s why, as Christians, we need to preach the gospel &ndash; the true, Biblical gospel. Only the gospel has the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes. Only the true gospel will change hearts and minds, which will bring about a true transformation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, what should we do as Christians to fight against the moral decline that the Manhattan Declaration so clearly points out? We should do what Scripture says:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, 20teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. - Matt 28:19-20</em></p>\n<p>\n\tMaking disciples begins with preaching the gospel, and it is by our preaching that God is pleased to bring faith to those He chooses (Romans 10:17). Once a person becomes a believer, the church is to help us grow in our sanctification. How? By preaching the word of God (John 17:17; 2 Timothy 4:1-5). As we grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, we are to live holy lives, and by our works God is glorified.</p>\n<p>\n\tMatthew 5:16 instructs us to:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when some in the church behave like the world, we need to judge them and discipline them (Matthew 18:15-20). Scripture tells us to judge ourselves (i.e., as Christians in the fellowship of the church); let God will judge the world. By keeping ourselves pure, our light can shine before men and God will be glorified, and perhaps He will use us to change others...eternally!&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tMy wife and I recently drove to Florida to visit her mother, and while getting gasoline in Mississippi, a billboard caught my eye: \"Give God a Chance.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tSurely, our brothers and sisters at this church have the right intentions with this billboard. All Christians want others to become believers. Scripture even calls us to &ldquo;beg&rdquo; others to come to Christ, as we read in 2Corinthians 5:20, &ldquo;Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"Give God a Chance\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/sign(1).jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px; float: left; width: 400px; height: 188px;\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a couple of important words in 2Corinthians 5:20 that we should consider. The word appeal means to &ldquo;call to one&rsquo;s side,\" as in Christians calling unbelievers to become believers. It also means to &ldquo;exhort, admonish,\" as in warning others. The word beg means &ldquo;desire, long for.\" So, as Christians, we are to warn others to come to Christ and be reconciled to God, as that should be our desire. Surely those who posted this billboard desire that others be saved, but does this mean that God simply wants others to &ldquo;give Him a chance?\"</p>\n<p>\n\tThink about what this implies. Just give God a chance; you may not like Him, but, hey, you just might! As though God were like crawdads (we also went to Louisiana, so crawdads came to mind). How will you know if you like it if you don&rsquo;t try it?</p>\n<p>\n\tIs this what God&rsquo;s word says? The very notion that we simply ask someone to give God a chance is un-Biblical. Look again at the verse above. Paul commands that we be &ldquo;reconciled to God;\" it&rsquo;s not an option. Likewise, we read in Acts 17:30-31:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Paul here is &ldquo;pleading&rdquo; with the pagans at Mars Hill, he is not asking them to simply &ldquo;try out&rdquo; this other god they have not yet tried. No, he is telling them God has declared that all should repent and believe in Jesus Christ. Again, unlike crawdads, God is not something you should try because you may like it. We are commanded to be reconciled to God through His Son, Jesus Christ. To not repent and believe means you will not be reconciled to God, which means you will go to hell for all eternity.</p>\n<p>\n\tToo often today, I find that we have watered down God&rsquo;s word trying to soften its impact. It seems we do this in order to not offend others. The political correctness of our day appears to have invaded the church and its salvation message. We do not find this in Scripture, however. Indeed, our Lord tells us in His word that He and His gospel are an offense, as in 1Peter 2:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>For this is contained in Scripture: \"BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\" This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, \"THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,\" and, \"A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE;\" for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, rather than watering down God&rsquo;s word by asking people to give God a chance, let&rsquo;s give unbelievers the pure, unadulterated truth, that they must repent and believe! This is what the apostles did, and it is what we should do as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tDoes this mean we should scream and yell at people? Should we hit them over the head with our Bible (e.g., &ldquo;You think that hurts? Wait until you get to hell!&rdquo;...not a recommended tactic!)? No, Scripture tells us in 1Peter 3:14-16:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED, but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence; and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tNote that while we are to give the gospel with &ldquo;gentleness and respect,\" we are to give the truth. In addition, because we give the truth we are told we may suffer, but we are not to fear what others may do to us, knowing that we serve Christ. Even if we are killed for the sake of the gospel, we know that our eternity is with Christ in heaven.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, brothers and sisters, let us be bold in sharing our faith, preaching the truth in love. It is better for others to know that salvation is by faith in Christ alone, and to not believe means eternity in hell. The pure truth is better than a watered down message. Although some will surely take offense at the gospel, some will not be offended. As our Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed is he who does not take offense at Me.&rdquo; (Luke 7:23)</p>\n<p>\n\tLet&rsquo;s share the blessing with which we have been blessed.&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tRecently, I began reading a fascinating book by Dr. Nabeel T. Jabbour, entitled The Crescent Through the Eyes of the Cross. Though I&#39;ve only finished the first few chapters, I&#39;m already hooked. Dr. Jabbour is an Arab Christian, who grew up in the Middle East and now resides in Colorado, and in this book he offers the western Christian a chance to see Christianity and the West through the eyes of an Arab Muslim.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"The Crescent Through the Eyes of the Cross: Christian Soldier\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/crescent.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px; float: right; width: 143px; height: 215px;\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tI am finding Dr. Jabbour&#39;s unique perspective insightful, and I&#39;m sure it will be helpful to me as I have opportunity to minister to Muslims in the future. The real gems in this book, however, come from Dr. Jabbour&#39;s remarkable observations on the American Church itself. Specifically, I cheered Dr. Jabbour&#39;s careful examination of the distinction between \"Christendom\" and the kingdom of God:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"There has been an evolution in our \"Christian\" history. In the beginning, those who believed in Christ were known as followers of the Way. In time, they were called Christians. In the fourth century, the emporer Constantine institutionalized Christianity, and it evolved into \"Christendom.\" The church entered into a \"holy matrimony\" with the state.\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"In contrast to Christendom, the kingdom of God has to do with the invisible rule of God, the expansion of the gospel irrespective of who rules the land and living with Christlike attitudes and behavior...\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"...The kingdom of God has to do with the eternal rule of God.&nbsp;For Christians, our primary citizenship is the kingdom of God, not Christendom or Western culture.\"</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \">\n\t- Excerpts taken from \"The Crescent Through the Eyes of the Cross,\" page 51</p>\n<p>\n\tAmen!!</p>\n<p>\n\tThe misson of the Church and of every Christian is to build the kingdom of God by seeking the lost and living out the Gospel. As Jesus said in Mark 5:16:</p>\n<p>\n\tLet your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead of pursuing this kingdom, too often Christians seek to build Christendom, which is Dr. Jabbour&#39;s term to describe the West&#39;s affinity for the Judeo-Christian ethic and general promotion of a Christian worldview within society. This is cultural Christianity, and it should never be confused with the kingdom of God.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristians in the West (particularly the United States) often champion and defend Christendom rather than supporting the spread of the kingdom of God through the message of the Gospel. Ironically, Christians may win the battle of promoting Christendom by electing conservative politicians and pro-family judges, outlawing sinful behaviors and obtaining governmental protections for religious practices &ndash; yet in the end gain nothing for the kingdom of God. Our victories for Christendom will never - by themselves - advance the kingdom of God. For that, Christians must be prepared to preach and live out the Gospel.</p>\n<p>\n\tDr. Jabbour observes that the kingdom of God often flourishes in places like China, where Christendom is weak or nonexistant and persecution is common. Conversely, in most Western countries where Christendom is strong, the kingdom of God is stagnant or even shrinking. Could it be that our cultural support for Christendom is an impediment to the growth of the kingdom of God???</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead of working to bolster Christendom, Christians should work to recruit and train new citizens for God&#39;s eternal kingdom. Along the way, we may take steps to support Christendom within society, but only so long as Christendom&#39;s existence furthers the Gospel, which as Dr. Jabbour points out, isn&#39;t necessarily the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the final analysis, God&#39;s kingdom cannot be found in this world (at least not until Christ returns to establish it Himself), so neither should we form personal allegiences nor establish ministerial objectives that seek to substitute earthly achievements for God&#39;s spiritual purposes. As Jesus said in John 18:36:</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus answered, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are not Americans who practice Christianity. We are Christians who happen to live in America (or wherever we may reside), but our true home is in Heaven. With that in mind, we should make it our goal to devote ourselves to the mission Christ handed us - without becoming distracted by the affairs of this world.</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps Paul said it best in his instructions to Timothy concerning the discharging of his pastoral duties:</p>\n<p>\n\tSuffer hardship with me, as a good <strong>Christian soldier</strong>. No Christian soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier. - 2Tim 2:3-4</p>\n"

While many businesses and vitually all charities are struggling to maintain services in the face of diminishing revenues, prosperity gospel preachers are doing remarkably well, according to the article.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Times article focused on the Southwest Believers&#39; Convention in Fort Worth, Texas, where the usual cast of prosperity gurus delivered their predictable pitches to an estimated 9,000 followers seeking a share of the financial success clearly enjoyed by the event&#39;s headliners.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Symptoms</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe speakers, many dressed in expensive designer clothing, paraded across the convention stage making frequent references to their country club lifestyle and their private jets. While crediting God for their \"blessings,\" the prosperity teachers intentionally provoked envy among their followers, who eargerly responded by funding a \"seed\" for their own future properity.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"Prosperity Gospel Preachers: The Antidote to Apostasy\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/donations1.jpg\" style=\"margin: 15px 10px; float: left; width: 250px; height: 250px;\" />Sadly, for all the attention this conference generated, there&#39;s truly nothing new here. The love of money is the root of all evil, as Paul declared long ago, and a love for money combined with a talent for manipulating the na&iuml;ve and gullible have long been the calling card of conartists the world over. Regrettably, the Church has been a favorite target of this heresy over the centuries as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tCenturies ago, Martin Luther famously initiated the Reformation when he objected to Rome&#39;s acceptance of indulgences, or donations offered by grieving relatives hoping to hasten a departed loved one&#39;s acceptance into Heaven.</p>\n<p>\n\tIndulgences were big business in Luther&#39;s day, because the Church had discovered that preying on fear and grief could be hugely profitable. When Luther exposed the heresy, he threatened much more than Catholic dogma or authority: he was meddling in the Church&#39;s financial lifeblood.</p>\n<p>\n\tCenturies later, itinerant preachers and salesman traveling across nineteenth century America perfected many of today&#39;s methods for parting a fool from his money. Peddled bogus medicinal cures and promising miraculous Holy Spirit healing in tent revivals, these charlitans showcased their own wealth and success to validate their message, and eager crowds readily accepted what they saw. Few victims ever recognized the obvious: the personal wealth enjoyed by prosperity preachers wasn&#39;t the product of a truthful message but of dishonest methods.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo be fair, the Bible - and particularly the New Testament - does have much to say on the topic of wealth, but the message is far different than the one preached by prosperity gospel proponents. From the parables of Jesus to the Apostles&#39; letters to the warnings in Revelation, the Bible consistently refutes the claims of these false teachers.</p>\n<p>\n\t(If you are interested in what the Bible says on the topic of money, I recommend you listen to The Love of Money Part 1 &amp; Part 2).</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Diagnosis</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIf the Bible&#39;s teaching on money clearly denies the prosperity gospel&#39;s claim that God desires to make believers rich in material terms, then why have so many people in our \"enlightened age\" fallen prey to this nonsense?</p>\n<p>\n\tBesides the message&#39;s obviously seductive appeal, the real answer is found in the Church&#39;s growing ignorance of the Bible. Greed and materialism have always existed, of course, but as George Barna and others have documented, the Church has experienced an alarming erosion of Biblical knowledge over the past fifty years among professing Christians, and a fool and his money are soon parted.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany churches are facilitating this trend by downplaying within their programs the importance of a deep and abiding knowledge of God&#39;s word, thus becoming satisfied with (at most) a superficial understanding of Scripture in their congregations. Even more alarming, ignorance of the Bible is now moving beyond the pews and into pulpits, as increasingly pastors themselves are becoming unfamiliar with the core doctrines and history of our faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis trend is largely to blame for the remarkable inroads prosperity preachers have made into many prominent congregations around the country, and it almost certainly explains many other ills within the Church.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Church&#39;s ignorance of Scripture has done much to prove true the old adage that \"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.\" Dangerous, indeed, and costly.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Cure</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, God isn&#39;t taken by surprise over all this. The writer to the Hebrews warned specifically of just such a situation, when he wrote in Chapter 5:</p>\n<p>\n\tConcerning [Melchizedek] we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing. For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food. For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant. But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil. - Heb 5:11-14</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this passage, the writer clearly connects the Christian&#39;s ability to discern good and evil (e.g., to discern good teaching from false teaching) with seeking a deeper understanding of God&#39;s word (i.e., the \"meat\"). Conversely, when a Christian fails to progress in this way, he will never acquire this important ability, and eventually he becomes a willing victim for the enemy&#39;s schemes - including the fleshly appeal of the properity gospel.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is the best antidote against the Church&#39;s slide into apostasy? Again, the Bible gives us the answer:</p>\n<p>\n\tI solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths. - 2Tim 4:1-4</p>\n<p>\n\tDon&#39;t you wish that every problem in life had such an easy answer? On second thought, maybe they do.</p>\n"

Can you imagine having the Lord God explain the entire Old Testament to you?! How incredible that must have been; it had to be the best Bible study those two disciples ever had!</p>\n<p>\n\tAn important lesson in that passage of Luke is how Jesus tells us that the Old Testament Scriptures testify of Him. I remember when I first became a Christian, I didn&rsquo;t like reading anout Jesus in the Old Testament very much. Many Christians still don&rsquo;t like to read it. However, once the Spirit showed me that the entire Bible is about Jesus and that He is pictured throughout the Old Testament, I came to love reading the Old Testament. It&rsquo;s exciting to look for Christ in every book, even on every page.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile I&rsquo;m no expert in this area and there are certainly several books written on this very subject, I thought it would be edifying to point out one of the most beautiful pictures of our Lord given in the Old Testament. What follows is from my own study, but I also relied heavily on a teaching by A.W. Pink on this subject. I highly encourage everyone to read Pink&rsquo;s discussion of types of Christ in the Old Testament.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Noahs_Ark-Memberger.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 500px; height: 384px; \" /></p>\n<p>\n\tWe find a type of Christ in the story of Noah. Both Noah and the ark itself are types, or symbols, of Christ. First, Consider the state of the world at the time of Noah. Genesis 6 tells us:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. The LORD said, \"I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tGod is about to bring His judgment and wrath on mankind for their evil ways. He was going to destroy everything He had made, except v.6 tells us &ldquo;But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.&rdquo; It is in this context that we begin to see both Noah and the ark as types of our Savior. Consider the following ways we find Christ in this story:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>1. Noah&rsquo;s name means &ldquo;rest.\" </strong> Genesis 5:29 tells us why Lamech, Noah&rsquo;s father, named him thus: &ldquo;Now he called his name Noah, saying, &ldquo;This one will give us rest from our work and from the toil of our hands arising from the ground which the LORD has cursed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tLamech was referring back to the promise God made to Adam and Eve in Genesis 3:15, prophetically speaking of the One who would ultimately deliver mankind from the curses that resulted from Adam&rsquo;s sin. Furthermore, Noah and his family were able to &ldquo;rest\" in the ark, as they were spared from God&rsquo;s wrath.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, Jesus is our rest, our Sabbath. In Him, we cease toiling and relying on our own works to save us. Only in Christianity do we find God doing all the work of salvation and providing rest for His elect. All false religions require man to &ldquo;do&rdquo; something to work their way to salvation. Praise God for providing a Savior in whom we can rest!</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. Of all the people in the entire world, Scripture tells us that God found favor in Noah.</strong> By God&rsquo;s sovereign choice, He would bring &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; to His elect through one man and one man only: Noah. Likewise, God has chosen from before the foundation of the earth to bring salvation to all of His elect through one man: His Son, the God-man, Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause of the work of obedience done by one man, Noah, he and his family were spared from the wrath of God. Similarly, because of Jesus&rsquo; work in His perfect, sinless life and in His obedient death on the cross, He was raised and all His family of believers will be spared from God&rsquo;s wrath on judgment day.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. God made everything subject to Noah</strong>. Genesis 9:2 says:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, Hebrews 2:8 says of Jesus:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>YOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tJesus, being God, is sovereign over all created things.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4. The ark itself is a symbol of Christ</strong>. Note that God&rsquo;s wrath was implemented through a great flood, and only those in the ark were kept dry, thus escaping God&rsquo;s just wrath. An important observation about the ark is found in Genesis 6:14:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the ark with rooms, and shall cover it inside and out with pitch.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Hebrew word for &ldquo;cover&rdquo; is kaphar, which means &ldquo;to cover, purge, make an atonement, make reconciliation, cover over with pitch.&rdquo; The Hebrew word for &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; is kopher, which means &ldquo;price of a life, ransom, or pitch.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, we could read this verse as &ldquo;covering the ark inside and out with an atonement that is the price of a life.&rdquo; Indeed, the ark got wet; it suffered the wrath of God while protecting those inside of it. What a beautiful picture of Jesus this is! He took the battering, the punishment we deserved, which was God&rsquo;s wrath poured out on Him in our place, yet all believers who are &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; will never experience God&rsquo;s wrath themselves, just as Noah and his family did not. Let us not take this blessing of salvation for granted.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>5</strong>. <strong>God established His covenant with Noah</strong>, and this covenant was an everlasting covenant. Genesis 9:16 says:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>When the bow is in the cloud, then I will look upon it, to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, the covenant in Christ is ever lasting, as Hebrews 13:20 states:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus our Lord</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Noahic covenant pre-figured the New Covenant, which is also eternal.</p>\n<p>\n\tI hope you found this analysis useful, and hopefully the Spirit has sparked in you a renewed interest in reading God&rsquo;s word, looking all the time for His Son. Let us be diligent to search the Scriptures, for they testify of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, in whom we have salvation.&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>When Moses stepped off Mt. Horeb carrying the stone tablets of the Law, he descended into a scene of debauchery within the Jewish camp. Aaron had failed miserably in his appointed role as shepherd over the recently emancipated Jewish tribes, and on his watch the people had forsaken their Lord for a golden calf they fashioned with their own hands.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Law.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:170px; margin-bottom:10px; margin-left:15px; margin-right:15px; margin-top:10px; width:400px\" /></p>\n\n<p>The sin of Israel was great that day, and for their offense against God and liberty, Moses responded by ordering the deaths of 3,000 men at the hands of the loyal Levite tribe. Ultimately, God put to death all the people who participated in idol worship on that day (Num 14:27-35) as a reminder that the sin of unbelief always brings judgment and death.</p>\n\n<p>In his anger and disappointment over witnessing the Israelites worshipping the golden idol, Moses shattered the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments at the base of the mountain. Through his immortal act, Moses captured perfectly the nature of man&rsquo;s sin in relationship to God&rsquo;s holy standard: when men sin, they break God&rsquo;s perfect law.</p>\n\n<p>The Apostle Paul taught that when men sin, they declare by their actions that they do not wish to be bound by God&rsquo;s perfection, but rather they believe they are a law unto themselves (Rom 2:1-2). In the end, man&rsquo;s sin is a rejection of the Lawgiver Himself.</p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h3><strong>Why the Law?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>There are at least four principle reasons for God giving men His Law. First, until the Law had been given, men could not fully comprehend nor appreciate how lofty God&rsquo;s standard of holiness truly was. The giving of the Mosaic Law gave men a glimpse of God&rsquo;s holiness.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the Law of Moses came to reveal sin to mankind. Without the Law, men could not fully appreciate the depravity of their condition nor the degree of offense God found in it.</p>\n\n<p>Third, the dietary and societal rules of the Law of Moses provided grace to men in their everyday lives, as it protected them from many of the afflictions common to the pagan world.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Law of Moses was God&rsquo;s instrument to drive men to know the true source of their salvation, that is Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Scripture tells us clearly and repeatedly that the Law was not intended to provide men justification (i.e., the establishment of righteousness before God) nor sanctification (i.e., the process of living out righteousness in our daily walk). The law of Moses was powerless to accomplish either of these things.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of justification, Paul says in his letter to the Romans that although the Law came to reveal unrighteousness, it was not to be a means for obtaining righteousness. Paul says that the righteousness of God was manifested apart from the Law (Rom 3:21); meaning righteousness comes by a means other than the Law, that being by faith (Eph 2:8).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the writer of the letter to the Hebrews says that the Law of Moses cannot make men perfect (i.e., sanctify them), but instead a &ldquo;better hope&rdquo; was needed to accomplish this purpose (Heb 7:19). So, the Law was given to reveal the penalty of sin, to reveal the need for atonement, and to reveal the Person of the atonement &ndash; but not to produce nor promote righteousness among men.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the strongest statement in Scripture declaring the Law of Moses should never be considered a mean to salvation nor holiness is found in Paul&rsquo;s second letter to the church at Corinth. In drawing a contrast between the Mosaic Law and the Law of Christ, Paul refers to the Law of Moses as the &ldquo;ministry of death&rdquo; and as the &ldquo;ministry of condemnation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>These are strong terms. Paul teaches that the result of seeking to find justification and holiness through doing the Law is condemnation and death. James tells us why this is so: if you endeavor to keep the whole Law yet break just one, God considers you to have broken them all (James 2:10).</p>\n\n<p>Compare those words to Paul&#39;s description of the terms of the New Covenant, which he calls the Law of Christ. This better Law Paul calls the &ldquo;ministry of righteousness&rdquo; and &ldquo;ministry of the Spirit&rdquo; (2Cor 3).</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/gavel.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:175px; margin-bottom:15px; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; margin-top:15px; width:175px\" />You could condense all the Bible says concerning the Law of Moses into a simple statement: the Law was given to show men their unrighteousness, but Jesus came so that He might make men righteous. Therefore, one naturally leads to the other. Paul says the law of Moses is a schoolmaster (or tutor) that drives us to Christ (Gal 3:24).</p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h3><strong>One At A Time, Please</strong></h3>\n\n<p>As simple as this concept may be, Christians throughout the centuries have consistently misunderstood the relationship between the Law of Moses given in the Old Testament, and the Law of Liberty (James 2:12) or Law of Christ (Gal 6:2) given in the New Testament scripture.</p>\n\n<p>More specifically, Christians often have been taught it is necessary to submit again to life under the yoke of slavery (as Paul refers to the Law of Moses in Gal 5:1). Such teaching mistakenly believes that observing the law of Moses in some form is a requirement for (or at least a means to) righteous Christian living.</p>\n\n<p>Such a view, however, fails to appreciate the mutual exclusivity of the two Laws (i.e., the Law of Moses and the Law of Christ). Theologically speaking, they are not intended to coexist or complement one another in the Christian experience.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, the scriptures make clear that the law of Moses and the law of Christ are mutually exclusive; they work together only in the sense that one leads to the other. We can never be subject to both simultaneously. Rather, we must leave one to join the other (Gal 3:25).</p>\n\n<p>The law of Moses and the law of Christ are, by God&rsquo;s design, opposites in most every respect. One brings judgment while the other brings mercy. One reminds us of our bondage while the other grants God and liberty. One is according to the flesh while the other is according to the Spirit. One reveals our unrighteousness while the other leads us to righteousness. One is powerless to cover for our sin while the other has the power to cover all sin for all time. (see Heb 7-10).</p>\n\n<p>The writer of the letter to the Hebrews uses several illustrations to make this point to his readers, none more compelling than the argument he makes in Chapter 7. In verse 12 he teaches that the priesthood is patterned and governed by the law that establishes it.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Levitical priesthood was established by the Law of Moses, but since we now look to a new High Priest in Christ (v. 26), then by necessity there must also be a new Law in effect.</p>\n\n<p>More to his point, the writer teaches in verse 18 that the Law has been &ldquo;set aside,&rdquo; and then in Chapter 8 the writer concludes that the Law was imperfect (v. 7), which therefore required God to replace it with something better (v. 13). Clearly, scripture teaches the Law of Christ replaces the Mosaic Law and does not work along side it.</p>\n\n<p>Paul illustrates the principle of exclusivity of law in the seventh chapter of his letter to the church at Rome. Borrowing from the nature of marriage, Paul declares that we were once all &ldquo;married&rdquo; to the Law of Moses, in that all men were judged by God according to the Law. Once we come to faith in Christ, however, we &ldquo;died&rdquo; with Christ to the Law.</p>\n\n<p>Now, having been &ldquo;born again,&rdquo; we are free to remarry (Rom 7:1-4), and consequently we are united in a new marriage to our groom, Christ. Paul&rsquo;s point in Chapter 7 of Romans is the same as the writer of Hebrews: a man may be bound by the Law of Moses or by the better, New Covenant of Christ, but he can never be bound by both simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>Once a man is saved by faith in Christ, the Law of Moses ceases to exist for that person. He has died to the old Law and now lives according to a new Law: the Law of Liberty (James 2:12).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/on_law_and_liberty_part_2/\">Continue to Part II...&nbsp;</a></strong></p>"

                 "body": "<p>In the <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/on_law_and_liberty_part_1/\">first part</a></strong> of my essay on God and Liberty, I explained how we are never under more than one law at times in God&#39;s economy. Before we go further in examining the nature of our new Law under Christ, it&rsquo;s important to understand that the law it replaces is a single entity in scripture.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>The Indivisible Law</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Contrary to what you may have been taught, the Bible never divides the Law of Moses into separate parts. In truth, there are not &ldquo;parts&rdquo; or divisions to the Law of Moses, nor do some of the Mosaic Laws remain in effect today while others have disappeared. The Law was given to the Israelites as a single unit consisting of 613 commandments, and Scripture always refers to the Law as an indivisible whole.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the clearest explanation of this principle comes from Dr. Arnold Fruchtenbaum of Ariel Ministries when he teaches:</p>\n\n<p><em>It is the principle of the unity of the Law of Moses that lies behind the statement found in James 2:10: &ldquo;For whosoever shall keep the whole law; and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.&rdquo; The point is clear: a person needs only to break one of the 613 commandments to be guilty of breaking all of the Law of Moses. This can only be true if the Mosaic Law is a unit...To bring the point closer to home, if a person eats ham, according to the Law of Moses he is guilty of breaking the Ten Commandments, although none of them says anything about eating ham.&rdquo; &#8232; - Excerpt from MBS006</em></p>\n\n<p>A Christian can&rsquo;t pick a few elements from the Law (e.g., the Ten Commandments) and place them in a special category apart from the rest of the Mosaic Law, especially if our purpose in doing so is an attempt to preserve them alongside the Law of Christ. Rather, the Mosaic Law is an all or nothing proposition: either a man lives under the Law of Moses and keeps all 613 laws, or he lives by faith and dispenses with the Mosaic Law entirely in favor of the newer, better law of Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this clear teaching of scripture, Christians are too often drawn toward combining the two laws in practice, if not in theology. Generally, these combinations are subtle, especially at first, and they usually begin with improper teaching on the purpose of the Mosaic law itself.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a man might one day hear his pastor teaching that Christians should observe a Sabbath by avoiding all work on Sundays. Since the idea seems sensible (and without proper teaching concerning the purpose of the Mosaic Law and the Sabbath), the man may be persuaded to put what he heard into action.</p>\n\n<p>The next week, he refuses to work any future Sunday shift at his factory job. Though he may feel good for his decision (and though it might be sensible for other reasons), the man has instituted a needless restriction for himself based on a false premise (i.e., God&rsquo;s word obligates the believer to avoid work on Sundays). In reality, the Sabbath restriction was instituted for the Jewish nation under the Law of Moses while the Christian who has God and liberty has no such restriction given in Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Later the man learns from his Sunday school teacher that Jewish culture observed the Sabbath on the last day of their week (Saturday) and not on Sundays. After further consideration the man decides to change his day of rest from Sunday to Saturday: he begins attending Saturday night worship services and refuses to work Saturday shifts at his job. Through it all, he grows increasingly self-satisfied that his strict adherence to God&rsquo;s word has pleased God.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming this man&#39;s decisions were not prompted by the leading of the Holy Spirit, he has merely performed a work of his flesh (i.e., following his own plan to obtain or display righteousness), and therefore he has pleased no one but himself.</p>\n\n<p>Under the Law of Christ, it doesn&rsquo;t concern God what day we attend worship services or if we cease working on one day of the week (Col 2:16). On the other hand, the reasons we choose to do such things do matter to God.</p>\n\n<p>If our actions are based on a mistaken belief that God requires us to adhere to the Mosaic Law, then we are acting like the unbelieving Jews of Paul&rsquo;s day who displayed a zeal for God but not in accordance with knowledge (Rom 10:2). We are repeating the sin of the Galatian church who desired to return to a yoke of slavery (Gal 4:9-10; 5:1; 5:4).</p>\n\n<p>Since that Law no longer exists for a Christian, we cannot look to it for a defense of our actions. God cannot approve our behavior according to a standard that He Himself has removed for us (Rom 8:3-4). Rather, we are to be led by the Spirit, and must take our direction from Him (Gal 5:18).</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Legalism</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The real danger for any Christian&#39;s misguided attempts to \"keep\" the Law is in its subtle and inevitable progression toward legalism, a lifestyle that views righteousness in terms of strict rules and limitations on freedom. Left unchecked by the counsel of Scripture and the leading of the Holy Spirit, living the Law often leads to neo-Pharisaical thinking and a life burdened with rules and restrictions designed to please God by works of our flesh. Sadly, works of the flesh neither please God nor make us holy.</p>\n\n<p>Paul points out the fruitlessness of attempting to become holy through restrictions on living in his letter to the Colossian church, when he writes:</p>\n\n<p><em>These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body but are of no value against fleshly indulgence. - Col 2:23</em></p>\n\n<p>Paul condemns legalistic restrictions again in his letter to the Galatian church, when he insists that those Christians who have acquired a desire to live by the Mosaic Law (and to be circumcised as well) were &ldquo;boasting in their flesh&rdquo; (Gal 6:12-13).</p>\n\n<p>Paul reminded the Galatians that they were saved by God&rsquo;s Spirit, not by their own efforts, yet their flesh still desired to take credit for God&rsquo;s work. The Galatians were attempting to stack their good works on top of grace in a futile attempt to increase their righteousness before God and, if it were possible, participate in their own justification or define their own path to sanctification.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I believe many Christians are unwittingly following in the Galatians&rsquo; footsteps, seeking to please God through works of the flesh, so that they might boast in their own righteousness.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>A Better Law</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Righteousness before God is so much more than simply keeping the Ten Commandments or even the entire Law of Moses. Paul himself said that righteousness was manifested apart from the Law and that no one will be justified by working the works of the Law (a statement he repeats in Galatians). Not only does this mean we can&#39;t be saved by working the Law, but neither can we manifest holiness in our lives as Christians by pursuing the Law.</p>\n\n<p>Both our justification and our sanctification are found only in Christ&#39;s life and Spirit living in us, since if we have broken one commandment, we have broken them all. Therefore, everyday we break all the Law, but thankfully God provided a better way to pleasing him: faith in Christ and reliance on the Holy Spirit means through faith in Him we have established or upheld the Law (Rom 3:31).</p>\n\n<p>The principle reason that the New Covenant is called &ldquo;good news&rdquo; is because of how it addresses all the weaknesses and deficiencies of the Old Covenant. Among its many improvements, the New Covenant we have in Christ provides a means of living a holy life, where before the Law was powerless to accomplish the same (Heb 7:18-19).</p>\n\n<p>Rather than attempting to keep a set of laws written on stone, which neither adjust nor grow to address our changing circumstances, Christians are to be guided by the Spirit indwelling us (Gal 5:13-18). As the Spirit convicts us of wrong behavior and instructs us concerning the ways of righteousness, we grow more Christ-like (e.g., 1Cor 2:16; Col 2:6-7).</p>\n\n<p>In submitting to the Spirit, we are living according to the Law of Christ (e.g., Rom 8:4; 12:1; Col 1:10; 2John 4-6). Walking according to the Spirit is now the law guiding all believers, and it&rsquo;s the only law we need.&nbsp;</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\t(This is Part 2 of the <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/the_megachurch_phenomenon/\"><strong>Megachurch Phenomenon</strong></a>.)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\tReason #2: Leadership Driven by Numbers<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tIn my introduction, I noted that the term megachurch refers to the size of the congregation, not the size of a building, but since large congregations require large buildings, this definition begs a question. Which came first, the large congregation or the large facility to hold the people? In many case, the answer isn&rsquo;t an easy one, because the size of the building and the size of the congregation share a complex relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf church attendance continues to increase, it first fills and then outgrows its facility, necessitating a move to larger quarters. In fact, a growing church often makes several facility changes over its lifetime, moving first from a home or school to a small rented space and then later to a larger rented or purchased building and finally to a permanent campus.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt some point, a church&rsquo;s growth plateaus, but in some cases, the growth skyrockets into megachurch territory. Any church on the verge of reaching megachurch size will suddenly find it can&rsquo;t accommodate the growth easily, so the emerging megachurch will often respond by constructing its own megabuilding, doubling or even tripling its current square footage in one step.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen designing the new space, the first question a megachurch faces is how big is big enough? Most church growth consultants will agree that the worst mistake a growing megachurch can make is to under build. Consequently, mega-churches typically build 50% more space than is immediately necessary in anticipation of continued &ndash; or even increased &ndash; growth rates in the future. This &ldquo;bigger is better&rdquo; philosophy can be summed up by that famous line from the hit Kevin Costner movie, &ldquo;If you build it, they will come.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this way, the relationship between congregation size and building sizes resembles a game of leap frog. First the congregation size surges forward filling the current space, then the building size is increased well beyond the current needs of the fellowship to accommodate future growth. The new building triggers additional growth, which then results in a need for additional new construction, and so on. In a few short years, a successful megachurch may invest millions or even several tens of millions of dollars in new construction, often amassing huge debt obligations and crushing overhead expenses along the way.</p>\n<p>\n\tLarge monthly debt and overhead payments increases pressure on the church leadership to keep the church seats - and tithe boxes - filled each week. The inevitable result is the megachurch must not only hold onto its current congregation, it must also grow attendance rapidly just to make ends meet. The staff becomes laser focused on measuring and tracking weekly attendance, so even a slight drop in in the numbers sets off alarms in church staff meetings. Consequently, packing in the crowds quickly becomes the number one goal of the megachurch ministry.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is where the trouble really begins. Since the megachurch must find a way to keep the church seats filled every weekend, there is an unhealthy pressure to make ministry decisions based primarily on what will yield the highest attendance and greatest enthusiasm among the faithful. In extreme cases, a megachurch may rely on a time-proven technique for attracting the crowds: give the people what they want.</p>\n<p>\n\tScripture tells us that the mission of the church is to be a witness of the gospel to unbelievers and a source of discipleship for believers in living a life of holiness and service to the Lord. These goals are in opposition to the &ldquo;If it feels good, do it&rdquo; culture of today, so megachurches will soften their image and adapt their message to keep the crowds coming back for more. After all, empty theater-style seats won&rsquo;t pay all those bills, now will they?</p>\n<p>\n\tGiving our congregations what they want rather than what they need is shameful, and this trend reminds me of the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s second letter to Timothy when he wrote, &ldquo;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires&rdquo; (2Tim 4:3).</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the context of today&rsquo;s megachurches, tickling ears takes the form of upbeat, jingoistic motivational sermons, Las Vegas-style worship spectacles; and youth &ldquo;sports parks&rdquo; and MTV rock concerts. Such techniques are not neutral in their impact; they are the telltale signs of churches shamelessly pandering to the fleshly desires of their spiritually immature congregations. Left unchecked, this numbers-driven philosophy is a cancer within the Body of Christ, ultimately bringing fulfillment to Paul&rsquo;s prophecy in 2Tim 4.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s worth remembering Christ&rsquo;s words in Matthew 16, when He told the apostles He will build His church. In fact, the entirety of Scripture teaches that Christ will build the church one believer at a time, through His word, and not based on man&rsquo;s work (Eph 2:8-10). Rather, we are to be like the sower, spreading the seed. As Paul said in 1Cor 3:6, men may plant the field or water it, but it is God &ndash; and God alone &ndash; who causes true, lasting growth. When men try to produce growth in their own power, using man-made ways, they stand to do little more than attract a church full of unbelievers.</p>"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tThere are three terms used in the Greek New Testament to describe the roles of church leadership. We can&#39;t understand one without also understanding the other two, since they all work together to provide leadership over Christ&#39;s sheep. What&#39;s the difference between a pastor, an elder, an overseer, and a deacon?</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>Episkopos</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis word episkopos (from which we get Episcopal) is used a total of 5 times in the New Testament, always in reference to someone who has authority to lead in ministry. It is usually translated \"overseer\" or \"bishop.\" Clearly, it is a position of leadership, most commonly thought to refer to the position of pastor. The dif&#64257;culty in understanding the full meaning of this word comes when we try to compare it to the second word used in scripture for leadership: presbuteros.<img alt=\"Presbuteros, Episkopos, Diakonos\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/elders.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px; float: right; width: 399px; height: 278px;\" /></p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>Presbuteros</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe word presbuteros occurs 72 times in the New Testament, and it has a range of meanings. The majority of the time (57 times) it is translated \"elder\" and means a position of leadership in the church, like a pastor or other member of church leadership. Importantly, it differs from episkopos in that it also assumes the quality of old age. In other words, elders are leaders, in part, due to the wisdom and spiritual maturity they have obtained through a life-long walk with Christ. In fact, the word presbuteros is also translated at times to mean \"older man\" (10 times) and even once as \"older woman\" (1Tim 5:2).</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there is yet still another term for leadership in the Bible we must consider: diakonos.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>Diakonos</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe word diakonos means &ldquo;one who serves in ministry&rdquo; or more generally, \"servant.\" The word appears 29 times in the New Testament. Of those 29 times, it is translated (by the NASB) as \"deacon\" three times, as \"minister\" seven times, and as \"servant\" 19 times. Consequently, the best de&#64257;nition of the duties of a diakonos is one who ministers to the church through their service.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsidering how Paul uses the term in Phil 1:1 and in 1Tim 3, it&#39;s fair to say that he viewed diakonos as playing a leadership role in the church, albeit a lessor role compared to epsikopos or presbuteros. For example, Paul expected that the determination of who may serve as diakonos would fall to the other leaders in the church (1Tim 3:10), clearly suggesting that diakonos answer to the other two positions.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, diakonos are part of the leadership within a church, and they express their leadership primarily through acts of service for the bene&#64257;t of the entire congregation (including other leaders). The best example of the appointment of diakonos within the church is found in Acts 6 where Stephen and six other men are appointed to positions of service by the primary leaders in that church.</p>\n<p>\n\tNotice that several of these men eventually became evangelists themselves (e.g., Stephen, Philip), demonstrating that those who begin ministry in positions of service as diakonos are not precluded from eventually taking other roles in leadership. To summarize then, diakonos are lessor leaders focused on service, while episkopos and prebuteros are primarily pastoral leaders over a congregation.</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, several questions remain: what is the difference between episkopos and presbuteros, especially in regard to their roles, and what is their relationship to the diakonos? There are three places in scripture we need to consult for the answers to these questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe &#64257;rst passage is Acts 20:17&ndash;28. In that passage, the Apostle Paul is nearing the end of his ministry, when he gives a &#64257;nal word of exhortation to the church in Ephesus. He begins in verse 17 by addressing the presbuteros (elders) of the church, yet a few verses later in the passage, Paul refers to these same men in verse 28 as episkopos, or overseers. By describing the same group one time as presbuteros and a second time as episkopos, Paul seems to consider the two words to be synonyms for church leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second passage of scripture to consider is Titus 1. In verse 5, Paul reminds TItus that he left him in Crete with instructions to appoint presbuteros (i.e., elders) over every city. In this context, an elder is clearly a position of leadership over a church, yet just a few verses later Paul begins to describes the quali&#64257;cations for an elder using the word episkopos (i.e., overseer) to describe this same group. Once again, Paul seems to use these two words for leader interchangeably.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt seems fair to conclude from these two passages that scripture makes no clear distinction between a prebuteros (elder) and an episkopos (overseer) in terms of their role in leadership. Therefore, we should consider these two terms to refer generally to leaders over a church, whether they serve as a pastor, an elder or both.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis fact also suggests that Paul was not especially concerned over the particular organizational form that church leadership assumed, though he does make clear he expects a plurality of leadership (i.e., overseers, elders) rather than just a single leader.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore we conclude this examination, we need to consider one &#64257;nal passage in 1Tim 3. In this chapter, Paul begins in verse 1 by stating the quali&#64257;cations for an episkopos (i.e., overseer). Later in the chapter, Paul switches to describing the quali&#64257;cations for a man to serve as a diakonos (1Tim 3:8). By these verses, we learn an important additional piece of information. We can see that Paul envisions a clear break in leadership between overseers/elders on the one hand and deacons on the other hand. While both groups are considered leaders in the church, the &#64257;rst group (e.g., overseers/elders) appoints and rules over the second group (deacons).</p>\n<p>\n\tIn conclusion, a classic New Testament church ought to be led by a plurality of overseers, including older, more mature elders who guard the &#64258;ock, together with a cadre of secondary leadership called deacons focused on serving the body. Though churches often depart from this ideal form, that certainly doesn&#39;t preclude God from working through those churches nonetheless, as every church has its &#64258;aws and God accomplishes His work through us in spite of our form, not because of it.&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tAfter listening to many of your teachings, I would like to know what you do when studying the Bible? &ndash; M.M.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I&#39;m<strong> studying the Bible</strong> I&#39;m using an inductive technique, which means I allow scripture to interpret scripture. The inductive study process involves three steps: observation, interpretation and application. The main tool for each step is the Bible itself, meaning that when there is a question in my mind as to a passage&#39;s meaning, I first look to other scripture to provide the answer.</p>\n<h3>\n\tObservation</h3>\n<p>\n\tAs I approach a text for the first time, I start with a careful observation of the passage. Even before studying the Bible passage, I try to obtain a good understanding of how the passage fits into its chapter thematically and into the entire book (and even the Bible) theologically. This means many hours of reading of scripture related to the passage under study. If I skip this step, I will often misunderstand the meaning of the passage or overlook some of its subtleties. I believe the failure to appreciate a passage&rsquo;s context is the primary reason there is so much poor interpretation of scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"Studying the Bible: Observation\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/eyeglasses.jpg\" style=\"margin: 19px 15px; float: left; width: 300px; height: 208px;\" />Having developed a good overall idea of the author&rsquo;s purpose in writing the passage, I then go through the text carefully noting the W&#39;s in the text (e.g., who, what, when, where, why). I note any names and places, and I look for the most important words (typically action words or key adjectives). Then I spend time studying a little on those items I observed, especially trying to understand any historical or geographical references found in the text, references to Old Testament scripture as well as any Hebrew and Greek words that I found especially interesting.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can&rsquo;t overemphasize the importance of learning the history and customs of the times in which the author wrote as part of a good study process. Too often we try to move the events and words of the Bible into our present day experience before we have completely understood them in their own historical context. This would be similar to a teacher living in the first century trying to explain the meaning of a Tom Clancy novel without an understanding of our technology and culture. It would result in utter nonsense.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou may have wondered if I know Hebrew and Greek, and the answer is no. Nevertheless, I have a method for understanding the meaning of specific words in these languages. Again, I use an inductive style of research to identify the meaning of these words. Specifically, I find every occurrence of a given Greek or Hebrew word in the Bible and arrive at an understanding of all possible meanings from the context of its various uses. I have some other techniques and resources for understanding the underlying meaning of the original languages as well, and taken together I can usually get to the heart of a word&#39;s meaning without actually knowing the language.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, a working knowledge of the languages is preferable, but a student of scripture shouldn&rsquo;t let their language limitations hold them back from studying in this way. The Holy Spirit will bring you what He wants you to know.</p>\n<p>\n\tOf the three steps in inductive study, the observation step is the most important, because it will guard against confusion, misunderstanding or the misconceptions brought by poor teaching you have heard in the past. I usually don&#39;t read commentaries or other teaching texts (other than for language studies), because I don&#39;t want my view of the text to be biased. I trust the Holy Spirit to guide me to what are the key points He wants me to find. I also know I can&#39;t learn it all the first time (or even the fifth time!), so I don&#39;t worry if I miss something.</p>\n<h3>\n\tInterpretation</h3>\n<p>\n\tWhen I have completed the observation step, I move on to interpretation. This is the step most often neglected by teachers, in my experience. I frequently hear sermons where the speaker gives some brief observations of the text and jumps directly to application (i.e., making his point for the day) without spending even a minute interpreting the text. By interpretation, I mean the speaker makes no attempt to explain what the original author actually meant when he wrote the text. Remember, the author didn&#39;t have a three-point sermon in mind when he wrote his book or letter. Nor did the author expect the text to be applied to a wide range of meanings many centuries later (though God did, obviously).</p>\n<p>\n\tRather, the author had only one meaning and one purpose in writing, and unless we properly identify that one meaning in our study, we are bound to misinterpret the text. The fact that a given passage can be applied in ten different ways doesn&#39;t automatically mean that the author had all ten applications in mind when he wrote the text. So, I work very hard to determine (as best I can) what the author actually meant by what he wrote.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy favorite example of misusing a text this way can be found in Romans 10:13-15. This well-known passage is often used to support the application that Christians need to go out and evangelize, otherwise some people won&#39;t receive the gospel and be saved. Obviously, the need for Christians to go out and proclaim the Good News is a worthwhile point to make at any time, however those verses from Romans 10 have nothing to say on that point.</p>\n<p>\n\tIronically, Chapters 9-11 of Romans actually teach an opposite perspective in some sense (in that they explain why the Jewish people are not prone to receiving the Gospel), so to use these verses to support the idea that salvation is on the line for those who haven&#39;t heard the Gospel is actually an incorrect use of scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul didn&#39;t have Christian evangelism on his mind when he wrote those words, so neither should we when we teach from them. We should seek to understand what Paul actually meant and then teach the passage in that way. If we want to preach on evangelism, we should seek out other passages which directly address that issue (and there are plenty), rather than misusing these verses in Romans.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason passages like Romans Chapter 10 are misused in this way is because men don&#39;t take time to properly understand the argument Paul was making in Romans 9-11 and then understand the text in the context of that argument. That is the step of interpretation, and it takes patience and a willingness at times to teach against conventional wisdom when such convention is a product of denominational bias or tradition rather than sound Biblical scholarship.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"Studying the Bible: Interpretation\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/bible2.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px; float: left; width: 420px; height: 280px;\" /></p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>Application</strong></h3>\n<p>\n\tFinally, I try to incorporate an appropriate application into all my teaching. Not all teaching needs to have a direct application, since the Holy Spirit is ultimately the One responsible for making the application in the hearts of believers. Nevertheless, a good teaching can become a good preaching with an appropriate exhortation to the listeners to live a more Christ-like life in response to the lessons found in God&#39;s word.<br />\n\tThe temptation in this step is to make every application a personal one, meaning relying on personal experience for every example. I&#39;ve come to learn that this is not a good technique, as it makes the teaching sound very self-centered and it can become difficult for the audience to see themselves in the teaching. They become passive listeners unaccustomed to relating the teaching to their own lives.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the better use of application is to consider the most common or destructive patterns of behavior common to all men and women and allow those examples to come through in the teaching. In this way, people will more often see themselves in the text, and the conviction of the Holy Spirit will have its full effect.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my own estimation, application is probably my weakest area, as it is not a natural aspect of my gifting. The observation and interpretation steps are often much easier for me, but I can struggle to find a good application, leading me to skip this step altogether. I nevertheless continue to work on my technique in the hope that God will make good use of me despite my weaknesses (or maybe because of them!).</p>\n<p>\n\tI hope my answer has been helpful and worth the wait. I encourage you to build your own study disciplines, since the rewards of studying the Bible for yourself are far greater than any to be found in the teaching of others.</p>\n<p>\n\tMay the Lord bring you many opportunities to serve Him in the knowledge you have gained through your studies.&nbsp;</p>\n"

                 "body": "<p>\n\tAs Scripture tells us and as I&rsquo;ve written recently, God&#39;s word testifies about Jesus in the Old Testament. I want to again look at how we see Him. It&rsquo;s my hope that in looking at how the Old Testament gives us numerous pictures of Jesus, you will be encouraged to (re)read the Old Testament Scriptures in a new and exciting way, looking for our Lord&#39;s portrayal. It is amazing to consider how God is able to weave historical events in such a way that they might perfectly picture the Lord Jesus.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/David.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 350px; height: 354px; \" />We find a type of Christ in the story of King David and Mephibosheth. The context for this story is 2Samuel. In chapter 1, David learns of the death of Saul and Jonathan (Saul&rsquo;s son) at the hands of the Philistines. There also had been a long war between Saul and David (due to Saul&rsquo;s jealousy of David), but now that Saul was dead, David has been made king, as God had promised he would be.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn those days, when a king who had not been part of the family of the previous king took the throne, it was typical for the new king to track down all of the prior king&rsquo;s family and kill them to ensure there was no one remaining that could usurp the throne. Therefore, Saul&rsquo;s family became afraid and began to flee.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2Samuel 4:4, we read:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Now Jonathan, Saul&#39;s son, had a son crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the report of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened that in her hurry to flee, he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tBut David was a man after God&rsquo;s own heart, and he did not pursue Saul&rsquo;s family. After conquering some of the surrounding nations, we read in 2Samuel 9:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then David said, \"Is there yet anyone left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan&#39;s sake?\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\tDavid did this because of the close relationship and the covenant he had with Jonathan (1Samuel 18:1-3; 1Samuel 20:15-17). In 2Samuel 9:3-11, we read what happens next:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The king said, \"Is there not yet anyone of the house of Saul to whom I may show the kindness of God?\" And Ziba said to the king, \"There is still a son of Jonathan who is crippled in both feet.\" So the king said to him, \"Where is he?\" And Ziba said to the king, \"Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.\" Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and prostrated himself. And David said, \"Mephibosheth.\" And he said, \"Here is your servant!\" David said to him, \"Do not fear, for I will surely show kindness to you for the sake of your father Jonathan, and will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul; and you shall eat at my table regularly.\" Again he prostrated himself and said, \"What is your servant, that you should regard a dead dog like me?\"</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Then the king called Saul&#39;s servant Ziba and said to him, \"All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master&#39;s grandson. \"You and your sons and your servants shall cultivate the land for him, and you shall bring in the produce so that your master&#39;s grandson may have food; nevertheless Mephibosheth your master&#39;s grandson shall eat at my table regularly.\" Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. Then Ziba said to the king, \"According to all that my lord the king commands his servant so your servant will do.\" So Mephibosheth ate at David&#39;s table as one of the king&#39;s sons.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point, it would be good to pause and take a closer look at David, Jonathan, and Mephibosheth. As you may already know, David is a type of Christ, and he is a study all of his own, given the many ways in which the Lord pictures Christ in David. One thing we should consider, however, is what each person&rsquo;s name means. In Scripture, names typically say something about the person.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, David&rsquo;s name means &ldquo;beloved.\" We see Christ as the beloved as well (e.g., Matthew 3:17, 12:18; Ephesians 1:6; Colossians 1:13). Clearly, David is a picture of the Lord Jesus. Jonathan means &ldquo;Jehovah has given,\" or perhaps more appropriately, &ldquo;the gift of God.\" Mephibosheth means &ldquo;exterminating the idol.\" He is also called Merib-baal, meaning &ldquo;contender with Baal.\" This name has the idea of smashing idols, completely eliminating them.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith this understanding in mind, we see a picture of Christ in David and a picture of saved sinners in Mephibosheth. Jonathan can be seen as a picture of Abraham, in light of the covenant between him and David, similar to the covenant God made with Abraham (Genesis 15). Let&rsquo;s first consider Mephibosheth.</p>\n<p>\n\tEarly in his life, we learn that Mephibosheth suffered a fall that left him lame and crippled in both feet. Consider what this would mean, especially for someone in that day. As a person who cannot walk, one would be unable to do anything for himself. He would be totally reliant on those around him, completely at their mercy. Anything he could do would be limited by his disability; he could only do what a disabled person could do.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust as Mephibosheth fell, Adam fell and in Adam all sinned (Romans 5:12), leaving all of humanity crippled, spiritually speaking - indeed, spiritually dead, according to Scripture. In other words, as fallen sinners, all we can do is what a sinner does: sin! Though we have a certain degree of freedom, our free will is limited by our fallen nature. Just as a cripple is limited by his disability, mankind&rsquo;s free will is limited by sin. As you have likely heard, we are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners. To change our plight, we need the aid of someone outside of ourselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom Mephibosheth&rsquo;s perspective, when he heard that David wanted to see him, this was probably not good news. Remember, in those days new kings typically killed the remaining relatives of the previous king. In Mephibosheth&rsquo;s eyes, he is an enemy of David, so he never sought out David nor did he want to be found. In his mind, the only thing he could expect from David would be judgment, punishment and ultimately death.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, as unbelievers we never seek God, we are enemies of God, and we know in our spirit that after death comes judgment, as Hebrews 9:27 testifies:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord tells us in Romans 3:10-12:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE; THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD; ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, Romans 5:10 says:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tWere it not for action on God&rsquo;s part, we would be without hope. This is where David becomes a picture of Christ. Note that it is David who calls for Mephibosheth and that he does this because of the covenant he made with Jonathan, that he would show his lovingkindness to his household. (By the way, the Hebrew word for &ldquo;lovingkindness&rdquo; is \"checed,\" pronounced &ldquo;kheh&#39;-sed.\" It&rsquo;s a beautiful Hebrew word to memorize, if for no other reason than to remind us of what God has done for us in Christ.)</p>\n<p>\n\tGod also made a covenant with Abraham, one that is fulfilled in the New Covenant. It is in this sense that Jonathan is &ldquo;the gift of God,\" because salvation is of the Lord, by faith in Jesus Christ. Ephesians 2:8 tells us:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tRomans 6:23 says:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tNot only that, Jonathan has the land that belonged to Saul restored to him, just as believers are restored to a right relationship with our all holy God. In the same way Mephibosheth did nothing to be reconciled to King David, we did nothing to be reconciled to God. He is the one who calls, and He is the one who saves. As Paul taught in Romans 9:16:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tMephibosheth had absolutely nothing to offer David; indeed, being disabled, David would have to care for him. Similarly, we have nothing to offer God, yet He saved us and truly cares for us in our daily walk. It is because of His grace and mercy that He saves us.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne additional item of interest is found in the word &ldquo;lame,\" which describes Mephibosheth&rsquo;s feet. The word in Hebrew has a double meaning. It is the Hebrew word &ldquo;pacach,\" and it can also mean to &ldquo;pass over.\" In fact, it is the same word used in Exodus 12 when the Lord says He will pass over the houses of the Israelites that are marked with the blood of the lamb.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is yet another incredibly beautiful picture of God&rsquo;s saving work, in both Mephibosheth&#39;s life and in the lives of saved sinners. Just as the Lord God passed over the houses that were covered with the blood of the lamb and did not kill the firstborn in Moses&#39; day, so the Lord passes over us who are covered with the blood of the Lamb who took our punishment that we deserved, thereby saving us from the wrath of God. Like Paul said in Romans 5:9:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tOnce called to David&rsquo;s palace, we see Mephibosheth treated as one of the king&rsquo;s family. The prophet wrote in 2Samuel 9:11 and 13:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>So Mephibosheth ate at David&#39;s table as one of the king&#39;s sons...So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he ate at the king&#39;s table regularly. Now he was lame in both feet.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, believers are adopted by God, made sons of God. 1John 3:1 says:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tIn Galatians 3:26, Paul taught:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis emphasizes the personal relationship believers have with God the Father through God the Son. Note also that once Mephibosheth has been adopted into David&rsquo;s family, we are told he remains &ldquo;lame in both feet.\" Likewise, when we become believers, there is nothing that we can do to contribute to our salvation after the fact. For a time at least, we are still sinners (i.e., lame in both feet), but our salvation rests solely on Christ&rsquo;s righteousness credited to us, not our own, made possible by Christ&rsquo;s propitiatory sacrifice on the cross.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, salvation is not based on what we do, but on what Christ has done. Halleluia!</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, this does not mean that we continue in sin. This is where the meaning of Mephibosheth&rsquo;s name comes into play. We are to &ldquo;exterminate the idols&rdquo; in our life, because now we have but one God whom we love and worship. We are to shatter everything that takes our love and attention away from God, things that cause us to care more about them than we care about God. He is to be the center of our lives, and we are to follow Him obediently, living and walking in the Spirit, and not in the flesh. Jonah 2 puts it very well: &ldquo;Those who regard vain idols forsake their faithfulness, but I will sacrifice to You with the voice of thanksgiving that which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is from the LORD.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tI hope you found this useful and that it has sparked a renewed interest in reading God&rsquo;s word, looking all the time for His Son. Let us be diligent to search the Scriptures, for they testify of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, in whom we have salvation.&nbsp;</p>\n"
