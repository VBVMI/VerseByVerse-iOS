                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: In the VBVMI <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation Study</a>, Pastor Armstrong mentions &lsquo;White Throne Judgement&rsquo;, I think #20D, that the average person living in the Millennial Kingdom has never seen Jesus in his Temple because they are not priests, and only priests can go into the &lsquo;Holy of Holies&rsquo;. But doesn&#39;t John call all believers, in faith, priests?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;All believers in the church today are called priests, as you said, because our bodies collectively are the temple of God (1Cor 6:19). Christ dwells among men on earth by His Spirit dwelling in the bodies of believers. In the Kingdom to come on earth, however, the temple will no longer be our physical bodies.&nbsp;Instead, a new physical temple building will be constructed for the Kingdom period, according to Ezekiel and Isaiah, and the Lord will inhabit that building as He once did in Israel&rsquo;s past.&nbsp;<br />\nThe best description of Jesus entering the Kingdom temple is given in Ezekiel 43. The prophet was shown a vision of the future temple (which Ezekiel calls the&nbsp;&ldquo;house&rdquo; of the Lord) as the Lord enters to reign:</p>\n\n<h5>Ezek. 43:1&nbsp;Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing toward the east;&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 43:2&nbsp;and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the way of the east. And His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 43:3&nbsp;And it was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, like the vision which I saw when He came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the vision which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 43:4&nbsp;And the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate facing toward the east.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 43:5&nbsp;And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 43:6&nbsp; Then I heard one speaking to me from the house, while a man was standing beside me.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 43:7&nbsp;He said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the sons of Israel forever. And the house of Israel will not again defile My holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their harlotry and by the corpses of their kings when they die,&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 43:8&nbsp;by setting their threshold by My threshold and their door post beside My door post, with only the wall between Me and them. And they have defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have committed. So I have consumed them in My anger.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 43:9&nbsp;&ldquo;Now let them put away their harlotry and the corpses of their kings far from Me; and I will dwell among them forever.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice that in the Kingdom, Jesus will appear as the SHechinah glory of God, not as a man as in the days He first walked the earth. Furthermore, the Lord declares He will never leave His throne in the house of the Lord again. Therefore, in order for Jesus to be seen during the Kingdom, a person must have access to the Holy of Holies or some other part of the Millennial Temple. You may find the <a href=\"/bible-studies/ezekiel\">Ezekiel</a> Study helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, during the time of the Kingdom, the Lord institutes a new Kingdom Law. The Kingdom law brings with it a new priesthood (see Heb 7:12). The requirements of the Kingdom law are given in Ezekiel 44-46, and in Ezekiel 40-43 we learn that Levitical priests will once again live around and officiate in the Kingdom temple.&nbsp;<br />\nIsaiah tells us that all the Kingdom nations will have the opportunity to witness the glory of Christ in the temple:</p>\n\n<h5>Is. 66:18&nbsp;&ldquo;For I know their works and their thoughts; the time is coming to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and see My glory.&nbsp;<br />\nIs. 66:19&nbsp;&ldquo;I will set a sign among them and will send survivors from them to the nations: Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Tubal and Javan, to the distant coastlands that have neither heard My fame nor seen My glory. And they will declare My glory among the nations.&nbsp;<br />\nIs. 66:20&nbsp;&ldquo;Then they shall bring all your brethren from all the nations as a grain offering to the Lord, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem,&rdquo; says the Lord, &ldquo;just as the sons of Israel bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord.&nbsp;<br />\nIs. 66:21&nbsp;&ldquo;I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites,&rdquo; says the Lord.&nbsp;<br />\nIs. 66:22&nbsp;&ldquo;For just as the new heavens and the new earth which I make will endure before Me,&rdquo; declares the Lord,&nbsp;&ldquo;So your offspring and your name will endure.&nbsp;<br />\nIs. 66:23&nbsp;&ldquo;And it shall be from new moon to new moon and from sabbath to sabbath, all mankind will come to bow down before Me,&rdquo; says the Lord.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice Isaiah says that all nations will see Him in the temple, and the Lord will take some of the people of these nations as His priests. Therefore, priests will include Gentiles in this period. If we are selected to be a priest in the temple, then we will have access to the glory of Christ in a regular way. Otherwise, our access will be more limited as a worshipper.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we know the nations will see Christ&rsquo;s glory in some limited fashion, but what they experience will not be what the first-century disciple experienced. The world will see the glory of Christ in ways similar to how Israel saw the Shechinah glory of God in the Old Testament. Periodically and in a limited fashion.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the Church saints are priests today, because the temple of God resides in our bodies, but in the Kingdom, the temple changes as does the law, and therefore the priesthood changes as well.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: Will time still exist in heaven? In Revelation, it talks about trees bearing fruit every month which seems to suggest time still exists. Can humans even exist outside of time like God does?&nbsp;Second, is hell eternal or will it be a punishment for a set time (1000 years) and then completely destroyed?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;Regarding time, the Creation will also exist in a place of time and space, since this is in keeping with our nature. Only God is omnipresent and without a beginning. Timekeeping in the New Eternal Order will be done in months only, not in years. So we will know a pattern of life (i.e., twelve repeating months), but we will not know a counting of years since there is no end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Hell is not the eternal abode of the unbelieving. Rather, the Lake of Fire is their eternal home, and it will last for eternity, as Jesus says:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 25:41&nbsp; &ldquo;Then He will also say to those on His left, &lsquo;Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;<br />\nMatt. 25:42&nbsp;for I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink;<br />\nMatt. 25:43&nbsp;I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not visit Me.&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 25:44&nbsp;&ldquo;Then they themselves also will answer, &lsquo;Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not take care of You?&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 25:45&nbsp;&ldquo;Then He will answer them, &lsquo;Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 25:46&nbsp;&ldquo;These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice, Jesus compares eternal punishment to eternal life. Just as we live forever in glory, the unbeliever lives forever in punishment.

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: We were listening to the VBVMI <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis Study</a>,&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>discussing 3C and 3D; you state in 3C, &ldquo;To come face to face with God while in a state of sin means death (eternal judgment) because God is compelled by His own perfect nature to judge sin and not ignore it.&rdquo; You said God would have been forced to destroy Adam and Eve if they hadn&#39;t hidden from Him. I take that to mean (and maybe this is a mistaken assumption) sin can&#39;t exist in the presence of such a holy God. If that is the case, how is sin allowed to exist? Are we not always in the presence of God? Why is judgment delayed (or ignored) if a perfect, holy God can&#39;t even allow sin in his presence? To me, that suggests either God&#39;</em></strong><strong><em>s&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>holiness isn&#39;t completely present or sin doesn&#39;t offend Him enough to destroy it.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;First, God is holy and just, therefore He will judge sin perfectly in the end, but in His forbearance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 3:25&nbsp;whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul explains in <a href=\"/bible-studies/romans-2017\">Romans</a> that&nbsp;in the course of discussing the sin of mankind that God passed over the sins previously committed because He intended to demonstrate His righteousness in Christ. Though God could have destroyed all sin on earth in the first moment, He demonstrated forbearance Paul says. Forbearance means waiting patiently for what is due or refraining from exercising a legal right. God has every right to judge sin &ndash; and one day He will do it &ndash; but for now, He is being patient so He may demonstrate His righteousness to the world.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, if men came face-to-face with God, judgment for sin in instantaneous because God can no long forebear what enters into His presence. &nbsp;As the Lod Himself explained to Moses:</p>\n\n<h5>Ex. 33:17&nbsp; The Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;I will also do this thing of which you have spoken; for you have found favor in My sight and I have known you by name.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nEx. 33:18&nbsp;Then Moses said, &ldquo;I pray You, show me Your glory!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nEx. 33:19&nbsp;And He said, &ldquo;I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the Lord before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nEx. 33:20&nbsp;But He said, &ldquo;You cannot see My face, for no man can see Me and live!&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>And Paul says likewise concerning Christ:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 6:13&nbsp;I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 6:14&nbsp;that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 6:15&nbsp;which He will bring about at the proper time &mdash; He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 6:16&nbsp;who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion! Amen.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In the same way that we cannot avoid judgment when we go before a judge in a court of law, neither can we avoid judgment for sin if we appear before God in sin. Consequently, the Lord has made a way for us to be made righteous through faith in Christ so that when we appear before the Lord in glory, we won&rsquo;t receive judgment. Meanwhile, we cannot see Him face to face.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In our present situation, we have the Spirit of God in us, but this is not the same thing as seeing God face-to-face. Notice in Paul&rsquo;s passage from 1Timothy that Paul describes in v.13 how Jesus stood in Pilate&rsquo;s presence while at the same time Paul says in v.16 that Jesus dwells in unapproachable light. Clearly, the Lord can present Himself to mankind when He desires in ways that do not threaten our existence, while at other times He dwells in His full glory which we cannot approach in sin.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

In v.3 Jesus introduces the idea of works in relationship to the blind man&rsquo;s condition. Specifically, Jesus says this man was born blind (i.e., made to be blind by God) so that his healing could become a means of glorifying Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Notice in v.3 Jesus says the &ldquo;word of God&rdquo; will be displayed in this man&rsquo;s healing. This statement means that the &ldquo;works&rdquo; mentioned in this passage are the works that God alone can do. More specifically, Jesus is referring to the works that God does through men. In this case, God made a man blind so He could heal him by means of a Man (i.e., Jesus).</p>\n\n<p>The next thing Jesus says is&nbsp;&ldquo;We must work the works of Him who sent Me.&rdquo; The question then becomes who did Jesus mean when He said &ldquo;we?&rdquo; The widely held view is that Jesus meant men+Jesus. In this case, Jesus was saying that He and His disciples must do the works of God (the Father).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The other possible answer is Jesus meant Jesus+Spirit (as Pastor Armstrong taught). In this case, Jesus was saying He and the Spirit are working to heal blind men (and other miracles) to serve a purpose the Father ordained in the Messiah&rsquo;s arrival. As long as the Messiah is in the world, He must accomplish these miracles (in partnership with the Holy Spirit), for this is how the Messiah is to be known and glorified. For this reason, the blind man was born blind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>How do we know which answer is correct? Jesus gives us the answer by what He says next.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus said that the work of &ldquo;we&rdquo; can continue only until &ldquo;night.&rdquo; In the darkness, no one can work. Then Jesus defines Himself as the Light (i.e., the day). In other words, Jesus says that His presence in the world makes this work possible, but when He departs these works must stop. Notice Jesus doesn&rsquo;t indicate they will begin again. Once the Messiah is gone from the earth, this work will stop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we must conclude that the&nbsp;&ldquo;we&rdquo; refers to the unique and temporary works that the Messiah and the Spirit accomplished during His earthly life. These works served a special purpose and were limited to the Messiah himself. While others were permitted to perform miracles as well (e.g., the apostles), nevertheless those opportunities were never equal to the work Jesus and the Spirit accomplished during his three years of earthly ministry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, this statement doesn&rsquo;t preclude the body of Christ performing many other&nbsp;&ldquo;works&rdquo; and even miracles to a limited degree, but Jesus wasn&rsquo;t addressing these works. He was speaking specifically of the unique works that He and the Spirit would accomplish together invalidating His claims. He made this comment in response to the disciples&rsquo; questioning of this man&rsquo;s condition, and Jesus was explaining that this man&rsquo;s condition was a necessity for the&nbsp;demonstration&nbsp;of the Messiah in His day.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><b><i>Q:&nbsp;How do I stop the enemy from making me doubt the Word of God? I am very sorry towards God because the enemy often tries to sneak doubt in my mind and it really saddens me. Also, the enemy has often tried to use a tactic to make me doubt the Word of God. What the enemy would do is, tell me that &ldquo;the book of Isaiah was only half inspired&rdquo; and he uses liberal scholars who cling to the heresy of &ldquo;deutero-Isaiah theory&rdquo;, (multiple authors).</i></b></p>\n\n<p>A: It sounds as if you are already aware that your doubts are unfounded and that they are the product of Satan. As such, then the scriptures teach what to do:</p>\n\n<h5>James 4:6&nbsp;But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, &ldquo;God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nJames 4:7&nbsp;Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 4:8&nbsp;Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 4:9&nbsp;Be miserable and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 4:10&nbsp;Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>And the writer of <a href=\"/bible-studies/hebrews\">Hebrews</a> echoes this when he writes:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 12:4&nbsp;You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin;&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 12:5&nbsp; and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons,&nbsp;&ldquo;My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,&nbsp;Nor faint when you are reproved by Him;&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 12:6&nbsp;For those whom the Lord loves He disciplines,&nbsp;And He scourges every son whom He receives.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 12:7&nbsp;It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>These writers are reminding us that we must learn to resist such things and that the Lord allows the enemy to tempt us in this way to strength us and mature us just as our earthly fathers disciplined us for our own good. Rather than wish your trials gone, we recommend you take the opportunity to strengthen your will and mind by focusing on Christ and His word. As you do this, you will be better prepared to serve others.</p>\n\n<p>Since you have a large following, the Lord will be particularly interested in strengthening you spiritually. You cannot gain this strength without enduring trials. Christ endured much greater than you, so you cannot complain about such things (since a slave is not greater than his Master). Pride is an ever-present concern for those who serve Christ, and even Paul required a &ldquo;thorn in his side&rdquo; to contend with his pride. Therefore, accept these trials of doubt and work to overcome them through the application of spiritual disciplines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With respect to the specific doubts, you feel to God&rsquo;s word, you will find that as you study scripture more, you will doubt it less. For example, have you taken our Isaiah Bible study online? If you take the study, we are confident you will have plenty of reason to cease doubting, for the text itself testifies to its accuracy and trustworthiness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, you cannot commit blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, since that could only be committed by Israel. You can learn why this is true in the<a href=\"/videos/play/153/\"> Verse by Verse Ministry video teaching.</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n</p>"

The question that I have is that it appears to me that God uses different names all throughout scripture to describe himself so is the name so important that it would be a matter of salvation? I also am curious about whether or not The House of Yahweh should be viewed as a group of believers that just binds themselves to Gods old law (meaning I should not try to convince him of our liberation from Gods law), or are they, unbelievers and I should continue to try and speak of the good news)?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;The group you mentioned is part of a larger movement outside the church called the &ldquo;Sacred Name&rdquo; movement.&nbsp;Sacred Namers teach numerous theological errors; chief among them is claiming that the verbal pronunciation of a certain name will accomplish a specific spiritual work. This thinking confuses the Semitic cultural tradition of associated a person&rsquo;s name with their authority, power, renown, and character with a belief that we can appropriate those qualities by invoking the name.&nbsp;<br />\nFor example, consider the following verse:</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 2:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&rsquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The proper interpretation of this verse understands that to&nbsp;&ldquo;call on the name of the Lord&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;means to cry out to Jesus with a heart of repentance seeking His mercy and salvation. The sacred word groups teach a distorted, hyper-literal interpretation that merely stating the name of the Savior or the Father results in personal salvation. In other words, they believe that everyone who pronounces the name of the Lord will be saved.</p>\n\n<p>This heresy reduces the Gospel to a magic incantation. Even more bizarre, most sacred name groups teach that a person must pronounce \"the name\" in a special way using a certain ancient language to qualify for salvation. It&#39;s a modern-day form of Gnosticism in that they are offering a \"secret knowledge\" necessary for salvation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the end, they are merely teaching another works-based salvation, where the work is pronouncing special words. This is a false gospel, and any who have placed their hope for salvation in this nonsense are not saved. These groups are similar to other false movements like&nbsp;Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses or Mormons, which can all be classified as cults dispensing corrupted views of the Christian faith. Though some individuals within these movements may be true believers by God&rsquo;s grace only, the vast majority of their members are not Christian in any sense.<br />\n<br />\nYou can find additional resources at another <a href=\"https://www.sacredname.com\" target=\"_blank\">ministry dedicated</a> to debunking the sacred name movement.&nbsp;The website offers recommendations on books, articles, and resources to counter the errors of the Sacred Name movement.</p>\n\n<p>You may find our <a href=\"/bible-studies/romans-2017\">Romans Study</a> helpful with approaching a works-based religion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

I have a desire that I make a right decision about marriage and I want to make the correct choice, I need your help as to how I should approach this till I obtain assurance from the Lord that she is the right one for me.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;We regret we are not in a position to give you proper counsel on who you should marry or how you should approach your courtship process other than to remind you of what scripture teaches concerning marriage.</p>\n\n<p>First, a believer must seek a believing spouse:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 6:14&nbsp; Do not be&nbsp;bound together&nbsp;with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Even more, a believer should seek for the most mature, stable follower of Christ possible. Marriage is a partnership, where goals, values and practices need to work together to glorify Christ. Marriage also includes (at times) conflict and strife, and in all these things a believer should possess a mate who sees the world through a common lens of scripture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Spend time with your love interest asking questions about each other&rsquo;s view of scripture and of best to live to serve Christ. These conversations are important to uncovering spiritual differences, if any, and resolving them before marriage. For the same reasons, we also recommend spending time together with the person in prayer and Bible study.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Bible teaches we must remain unstained by immorality prior to marriage. As Hebrews says:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 13:4&nbsp;Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Remain chaste and do not engage in fornication. Remain pure waiting for the day of your marriage, and seek a marriage partner who has done the same.<br />\n<br />\n</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q:&nbsp;God had an angel turn against Him, and took a third of the angels with him. Is that prevented from ever happening again when all of us get there in heaven because Satan and his demons are thrown into the lake of fire and we are saved so deemed worthy to enter and never get a big head like Satan did? Did God use Satan kind of like Jesus used Judas for the purpose of getting the BIG PLAN accomplished?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;A survey of scripture teaches that demons (i.e., fallen angels) have become corrupt in nature like fallen man. These will not be redeemed since Hebrews teaches that the Lord does not give help (i.e., a way of redemption) to fallen angels. We also know that one-third of the angelic host were convinced by Satan to rebel against God with him, according to Revelation, meaning that&nbsp;the remaining two-thirds of the angelic realm did not follow Satan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unlike mankind, all angels were created at once rather than through a process of procreation. We know this because Jesus said in Matthew 22:30 that angels are not given into marriage, which implies they do not procreate. We must conclude that when Satan fell, he had the entire host of angels at his disposal, and of these, he convinced a third to follow him into rebellion. Notably, two-thirds of the angels were not fooled by Satan and remained faithful.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we can safely assume that the remaining angels will never fall, since the author of lies failed to draw them in his first attempt and there will be no future source of rebellion in God&rsquo;s creation according to Revelation 21. Simply put, if Satan couldn&#39;t convince the remaining angels to rebel in his earlier attempt, then they will remain faithful forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, we can assume that once we obtain our glorified state in the Kingdom, we will also be impervious to Satan&rsquo;s schemes. There will be no second fall of man, because the source of the fall (i.e., Satan and his lies) has already been judged, according to scripture. Scripture says we are no longer slaves to Satan and have conquered him through our faith in Jesus Christ. We have been made new in Christ&rsquo;s likeness so that we share in Christ&rsquo;s nature and in his desire to obey the Father.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, both the faithful angels and believers in Jesus Christ (i.e., the elect angels and elect humanity) are saved by God and forever preserved from rebellion. God&rsquo;s original plan for Creation allowed for and even desired a fall of both the angels and of mankind. Self evidently, the Lord permitted His creation to be susceptible to deception and rebellion in the first place, so that a fall would occur in both realms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Lord brought about these circumstances so that He might redeem the elect and thereby bring glory to His name for His mercy and love. This is the essence of Paul&rsquo;s exclamation in Romans 8:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nRom. 8:31&nbsp;What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:32&nbsp;He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:33&nbsp;Who will bring a charge against God&rsquo;s elect? God is the one who justifies;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:34&nbsp;who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:35&nbsp;Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:36&nbsp;Just as it is written,&nbsp;&ldquo;For Your sake we are being put to death all day long;&nbsp;We were considered as sheep to be slaughtered.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:37&nbsp;But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:38&nbsp;For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:39&nbsp;nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">You might find our </span><a href=\"/bible-studies/romans-2017\" style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Romans study</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"> helpful concerning this question.</span></h5>"

Would that be going against 1 Cor. 14; 34 if one does?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;Generally, in mixed groups the Bible expects men to lead teaching and to ask and answer the questions, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 2:11&nbsp;A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 2:12&nbsp;But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 2:13&nbsp;For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 2:14&nbsp;And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 2:15&nbsp;But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>On the other hand, this principle may include some minor variations in practice. Our ministry features several articles that explore this point in detail; &#39;<a href=\"/bible-answers/can_a_woman_teach_men_in_the_church\">Can a woman teach men in the church</a>&#39; and &#39;<a href=\"/bible-answers/can_a_woman_ever_teach_a_man\">Can a woman ever teach a man</a>?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, Paul does give a very specific command to the church in Corinth concerning women speaking up to challenge men during the teaching:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 14:34&nbsp; The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 14:35&nbsp;If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice in v.34 that Paul juxtaposes women speaking up in the service with women subjecting themselves to male headship (authority). Paul is implying that when the women in Corinth were asking questions, they were doing it for improper motives. The women were trying to undermine the authority of the male teachers by questioning their teaching.&nbsp;Their questions were not (apparently) asked in a sincere desire to understand the truth. Instead, the questioning was part of an effort to show themselves smarter than the men who taught them. It was a sinful motive.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, earlier in the letter Paul described how women in the church in Corinth were taking dramatic steps (including shaving their heads) to claim equality with men, which violated God&rsquo;s prescription for the church. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Paul&rsquo;s point in chapter 14 concerning women speaking in the assembly was limited to those women who spoke up expressly for the purpose of challenging and undermining male teachers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, we teach that it is permissible for a woman to ask questions in a mixed group so long as she does so with a genuine interest in obtaining clarification or to understand scripture better. She may ask her question publicly so long as her intentions are pure. If the questioning transitions into a confrontation, challenges or a dispute, then the woman should silence herself and expect her husband to answer her questions or else carry the questioning forward on her behalf (assuming he shares her concerns).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: Are Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Acts are the Old Testament? In order to have a testament, you must have the death of the testator. By the very Biblical definition of a testament as given in Hebrews 9:16-17 anything you read before the death of Jesus Christ is the Old Testament; the time of the law. The book of Romans tells us that the law ended with the death of Jesus Christ and we are now under an age of grace.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;Though you may not be pleased to hear it from us, your views of scripture are not accurate. In every case below, you have taken scripture out of context, distorting it&rsquo;s true meaning and misapplied it to support your preconceived notion. You are interpreting the scriptures <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisegesis\" target=\"_blank\">eisegetically</a>, which always results in a false understanding. Instead, you must interpret each verse in its proper context so as to uncover the meaning the author intended, which is the proper form of interpretation called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisegesis\" target=\"_blank\">exegesis</a>.</p>\n\n<p>None of the verses you quoted truly mean what you suggested they mean, and therefore the conclusions you draw from your misinterpretations (i.e., that the four Gospels are not intended for Gentiles, etc.) are both bizarre and unbiblical. In fact, scripture itself contradicts your conclusion:</p>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 3:16&nbsp;All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;&nbsp;<br />\n2Tim. 3:17&nbsp;so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the entire Bible preaches the same Gospel of salvation through faith in a Messiah sent to Israel and to the whole world. Genesis preaches this Gospel. Exodus preaches this Gospel. The prophets preach this Gospel. And certainly, the first four books of the New Testament preach this same Gospel, as does Paul and the other epistles writers. The Gospel Paul mentions in 1Cor 15 and elsewhere is the very same Gospel Jesus preached (it is His Gospel, after all), and it&rsquo;s the same Gospel revealed progressively throughout the Old Testament (Genesis-Malachi).</p>\n\n<p>As Hebrews declares:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 1:1&nbsp;&nbsp;God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 1:2&nbsp;in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>There is no &ldquo;Old Testament&rdquo; Gospel. Yes, many in Israel and many among the Gentile nations have neglected the true Gospel and have pursued a false salvation of works, but the Bible is not to blame for that mistake. Neither the Old Testament nor the New Testament told Jews or Gentiles to pursue God through works. The Bible has preached the same Gospel from Genesis to Revelation, but many refuse to hear it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As you said, only by faith in the promises of God may one be saved, and this is the way Abraham was saved in the Old Testament (prior to Christ), and it is also the way we are saved now. As Paul said:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 4:3&nbsp;For what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 4:4&nbsp;Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 4:5&nbsp;But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Finally, if you truly believe that the Gospel accounts are part of an &ldquo;Old Testament&rdquo; preaching of salvation by works, then you do not understand the Gospel nor do you understand the teaching of the Old Testament. We strongly advise you to listen to both our <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis</a> and <a href=\"/bible-studies/the-gospel-of-john\">Gospel of John</a> Bible studies to set your understanding of scripture correctly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We also feel compelled to remind you of scripture&rsquo;s warning concern those who would mishandle the word of God:</p>\n\n<h5>James 3:1&nbsp;Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Finally, it might help your understanding to remember that all New Testament scripture (including the Gospel accounts) were written long after Jesus&rsquo; death. So, therefore, all New Testament scripture was written after the Law had been completed by Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q:&nbsp;Is a church covenant/contract biblical? Do such requirements put us under a new law? Even if most of the requirements are biblical should a Christian agree to them? Where is my sin in this matter affecting my judgment? I&#39;m sorry for the long drawn out question.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;Regarding membership rules or requirements, you are correct that the Bible does not specify a &ldquo;membership&rdquo; process for a Christian in joining or participating in a local congregation.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Bible does imply the need for Christians to establish a relationship in a local body and submit to the leadership in that body. The book of Hebrews implies that believers should actively participate in a gathering on a regular basis:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:24&nbsp;and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:25&nbsp;not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So regular participation in a body of believers is a biblical expectation. Furthermore, believers are called by scripture to submit to the leaders of their church body:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 13:17&nbsp;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, on the basis of this c command, we can say that if church leaders decide to place certain expectations on the church body for the benefit of their spiritual health (i.e., requiring regular attendance on Sundays, participation in home groups, etc.), then the body should submit to those in authority. Such rules only become legalism if the leaders teach that the rules are God&rsquo;s requirements, not merely man-made expectations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, your pastor&rsquo;s comments connecting &ldquo;being Christian&rdquo; with attending church are very concerning. To equate attending church with being a Christian would seem to suggest a human work is required to be saved, which the Bible clearly refutes. No human work &ndash; not even attending church &ndash; is required to be saved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, we know it is possible for even true Christians to stop attending church precisely because the book of Hebrews warns of that very thing! In Hebrews 10 we read:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:24&nbsp;and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:25&nbsp;not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice the writer says some in the body have fallen into the habit of \"forsaking the gathering.&rdquo; The writer is acknowledging that believers can become lazy and disobedient so that they stop seeking for fellowship among other believers. Clearly, these believers are no less saved, though they are acting in a disobedient manner.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, we suggest you seek to clarify your pastor&rsquo;s comments in a respectful manner. If you should determine that he believes attending church is a conclusive litmus test for true faith, then we would recommend you consider seeking fellowship elsewhere, since such views are unbiblical and potentially harmful to your spiritual growth in the faith.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, every believer should be participating regularly in a church congregation, and if the leaders of that congregation place certain requirements on that participation, we should submit to their authority. Only in cases where these requirements contradict scripture or offend out conscience should we raise objections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, no human work &ndash; not even participation in a church service &ndash; is necessary for salvation. Faith alone in Jesus Christ saves us, and unfortunately, some who have this understanding may yet forsake gathering together with other believers.</p>\n\n<p>You may find it helpful to listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/hebrews\">Hebrews</a> study on our website.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

We follow Christ and proclaim the truth of His word.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the suggestion that obtaining a proper understanding of God&rsquo;s sovereignty in our salvation necessarily diminishes a believer&#39;s desire to serve Christ by acts of service or by reaching the nations with the Gospel is a false premise. On the contrary, the more a believer knows and understands the doctrines of their salvation, the more the person will be motivated to serve the Master Who bought them.</p>\n\n<p>The scripture is abundantly clear that the Lord grants faith in the heart as He chooses, which you could read our devotional, &#39;<a href=\"/devotionals/wrestling_with_god\">Wrestling with God</a>,&#39; but this truth doesn&rsquo;t diminish our enthusiasm to serve Him; on the contrary, it motivates believers to seek the lost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In fact, knowing that the Lord has the power to change a heart is the primary basis for our evangelism. As Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>Mark 10:24&nbsp;The disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to them, &ldquo;Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!<br />\nMark 10:25&nbsp;&ldquo;It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&rdquo;<br />\nMark 10:26&nbsp;They were even more astonished and said to Him, &ldquo;Then who can be saved?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMark 10:27&nbsp;Looking at them, Jesus&nbsp; said, &ldquo;With people, it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Salvation is impossible for men alone, but God can bring salvation to hearts by granting faith, and so we proclaim the Gospel knowing that those who have ears to hear will respond. God grants the ability to hear the Gospel:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 10:17&nbsp;So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, a believer&rsquo;s desire to serve God by preaching the Gospel or by any other work of service is increased (not decreased) by knowing that God is in control of the outcome. Our desire to serve Him is based in our confidence that the Lord is the One Who yields the results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, if we were personally responsible for the outcome in persuading a person to believe, we would have much less confidence to pursue evangelism, for who is capable of making an argument persuasive enough to overcome the pride of the flesh?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the&nbsp;other hand, if our prospects for success are dependent entirely upon God&rsquo;s grace, then how can we NOT act in service to God? Knowing God is in control of the outcome is a great motivator in moving forward as His ambassador, since God is capable of granting us success at any moment. We can go out serving Him in much greater confidence and enthusiasm knowing the result rests on Him alone.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you may find the&nbsp;article, &#39;<a href=\"/bible-answers/why_do_we_evangelize\">Why do we Evangelize</a>,&#39; helpful.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

Paul is referring to death using the word &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; just as we might say &ldquo;passed away&rdquo; today. He is not speaking literally of a sleeping process. As you quoted from&nbsp;2Cor 5:6-8, believer&rsquo; souls are immediately and consciously present with the Lord from the moment of our death. Later at the resurrection, we receive our new bodies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, passages like <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_luke\">Luke</a> 16:22-23 make clear that unbelievers also move directly from death to a conscious existence in torment. No one enters a time of unconscious&nbsp;&ldquo;sleep.&rdquo; Soul sleep is a false teaching of a false religion.</p>\n\n<p>Our website offers more information on the&nbsp;false religion of <a href=\"/bible-answers/is-the-seventh-day-adventist-church-a-cult\">Seventh-Day Adventists</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For further reading, we&nbsp;also have a full article focused on <a href=\"/bible-answers/explain_where_we_go_when_we_die\">where we go after death</a>.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: Is Paul saying all have the ability to be justified by grace? if so, how does this fit with the rest of his teaching about being selected before birth?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;Your confusion comes from taking these two verses out of their larger context in Romans 3.&nbsp;When we take vs.24-25 out of context, we lose sight of what Paul meant when he used the word&nbsp;&ldquo;all.&rdquo; So by returning to the context of the&nbsp;passage, we find the intended meaning of the word &ldquo;all.\" &nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 3:21&nbsp; But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,<br />\nRom. 3:22&nbsp;even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;<br />\nRom. 3:23&nbsp;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,<br />\nRom. 3:24&nbsp;being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;<br />\nRom. 3:25&nbsp;whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness&nbsp;because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;<br />\nRom. 3:26&nbsp;for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.<br />\nRom. 3:27&nbsp; Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.<br />\nRom. 3:28&nbsp;For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.<br />\nRom. 3:29&nbsp;Or is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,<br />\nRom. 3:30&nbsp;since indeed God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith is one.</h5>\n\n<p>Paul describes our righteousness may be found. The righteousness required to enter Heaven is the righteousness of God, given to us by God&rsquo;s grace, apart from works. Notice in v.22 that Paul adds that this salvation is &ldquo;for all those who believe; there is no distinction&hellip;&rdquo; Paul is saying that the means of salvation is the same for both Jew and Gentile. There is no separate plan for Gentiles apart from Jews. We find this conclusion confirmed further when we look at the end of the passage, as&nbsp;Paul concludes God is the God of both Jew and Gentile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when Paul uses the term &ldquo;all&rdquo; in this passage, he is referring to both Jew and Gentile. The word &ldquo;all\" doesn&rsquo;t refer to all humanity.&nbsp;<br />\nFor a greater understanding of these things, we strongly recommend you listen to our entire <a href=\"/bible-studies/romans-2017\">Romans</a> Bible study.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em><a href=\"/bible-studies/isaiah\">/bible-studies/isaiah</a>Q: Will you explain Matthew 7-18-20?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;The verses you asked us to explain are part of the following larger passage:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 7:15&nbsp;&ldquo;Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.<br />\nMatt. 7:16&nbsp;&ldquo;You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?<br />\nMatt. 7:17&nbsp;&ldquo;So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.<br />\nMatt. 7:18&nbsp;&ldquo;A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.<br />\nMatt. 7:19&nbsp;&ldquo;Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.<br />\nMatt. 7:20&nbsp;&ldquo;So then, you will know them by their fruits.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice that Jesus is speaking about false prophets. False prophets (or teachers) are those who claim to know the Lord and to follow Him but actually are not truly His disciples. They are false in every respect: they do not know the Lord, they do not know His word, nor do they following His commandments. Therefore, they are &ldquo;wolves&rdquo; masquerading as &ldquo;sheep.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Christ tells His true followers to avoid falling victim to these false teachers by evaluating the &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; in their lives. Fruit refers to the product of their ministry. Just as a tree&rsquo;s output is the fruit it yields after a season, so is a teacher&rsquo;s production measure by the lasting effect (i.e., fruit) they yield in the lives of their students.&nbsp;<br />\nJesus teaches the principle that true teachers of God&rsquo;s word will naturally and always produce good outcomes in the lives of their students, because these teachers are sharing the true word of God. The word of God itself is produces the fruit in the lives of the hearers, and since the teacher is sharing the word in an honest way, that teacher will naturally yield good outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, false teachers or prophets do not teach the word of God. Instead, they teach man-made conclusion in place of the word of God, as Jesus said a few&nbsp;verses earlier in this chapter:</p>\n\n<h5>Mark 7:7&nbsp;&lsquo;But in vain do they worship Me,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Teaching as doctrines the&nbsp;precepts&nbsp;of men.&rsquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Those who spread false teaching will&nbsp;always&nbsp;yield &ldquo;bad fruit,&rdquo; which refers to the absence of godliness in the lives their students. Those who listen to false teaching do not experience changed lives or develop greater love for and devotion to Christ Jesus and His word. They may experience a season of&nbsp;excitement or enthusiasm, but in the end they cannot grow spiritually nor&nbsp;show&nbsp;the fruit of the Spirit in their lives since they lack the pure milk of the word of God, as Peter says:<br />\n1Pet. 2:2&nbsp;like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, false teaching is not from God and therefore it lacks the power of God&rsquo;s word. So Jesus warns the believer to evaluate the product of a person&rsquo;s teaching to know whether such a person is teaching&nbsp;truthfully or not. In v.17-18 Jesus says that those who&nbsp;teach God&rsquo;s word cannot yield good fruit, since only God&rsquo;s word has the power to produce that outcome.&nbsp;Likewise, those who teach God&rsquo;s word honestly will always see&nbsp;good fruit, because the word of God will not go forth and return void, as <a href=\"/bible-studies/isaiah\">Isaiah</a> says:</p>\n\n<h5>Is. 55:10 &nbsp;&ldquo;For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And do not return there without watering the earth&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And making it bear and sprout,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater;<br />\nIs. 55:11 &nbsp;So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It will not return to Me empty,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Without accomplishing what I desire,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q:&nbsp;Why was Jesus named Jesus, and not Emmanuel?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;The Messiah goes by many other names in scripture, including Immanuel. &nbsp;The name given to the Christ child came directly from the Father Himself, as revealed by the angel:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 1:30&nbsp;The angel said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God.<br />\nLuke 1:31&nbsp;&ldquo;And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus.</h5>\n\n<p>The name Jesus is actually Yeshua in Hebrew, which is also translated Joshua. The name means &ldquo;the Lord is salvation,&rdquo; so clearly the Father wanted His Son to bear a name that announced His purpose. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is the earthly name for our Messiah, but before He was revealed to the world, the scripture speak of Him using other names. Collectively, there are over 200 different names or titles given to the Messiah in scripture. Taken together, these name describe the character and work of the Messiah in the plan of God.&nbsp;<br />\nThe first name the Lord gave Himself is found in Exodus:</p>\n\n<h5>Ex. 3:14&nbsp;God said to Moses, &ldquo;I AM WHO I AM&rdquo;; and He said, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, &lsquo;I AM has sent me to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Later in John&rsquo;s Gospel, Jesus continued to use this name in a subtle way, when He responded to the Pharisees this way:</p>\n\n<h5>John 8:58&nbsp;Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly,&nbsp;I&nbsp;say to you, before Abraham was born,&nbsp;I am.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>In His return to earth, the Lord will assume yet another name, as Jesus says in Revelation 3:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 3:12&nbsp;&lsquo;He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will not go out from it anymore; and I will write on him the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of My God, and the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God, and My new&nbsp;name.</h5>\n\n<p>So even the name Jesus is not the Lord&#39;s final name. His new name is described this way in Revelation 19:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 19:16&nbsp;And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, &ldquo;KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>So the question of what is the Messiah&rsquo;s name is different than asking a human being for a name.&nbsp;Since there is no one like the Lord, He doesn&rsquo;t bear a name to distinguish Himself from another. The only reason the Lord adopts a name is to describe Himself to His Creation.&nbsp;Therefore, the Lord names Himself as a means of describing Himself to mankind using multiple names.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

We don&#39;t have to ask for his forgiveness, but in order to be saved we must place our faith in what happens to Christ after his death, which is; we are to place faith in His resurrection?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;In recent times, a false teaching has emerged within the church to the effect that Jesus&rsquo; payment on the cross forgave the sins of the entire world without regard to faith. Usually, this teaching cites 1John 2:1-2 to support such a conclusion:</p>\n\n<h5>1John 2:1&nbsp; My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;<br />\n1John 2:2&nbsp;and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.</h5>\n\n<p>This interpretation is a misinterpretation of John&rsquo;s teaching and is contrary to other scripture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, John&rsquo;s teaching in 1John 2 is not arguing for universal salvation. John was writing to an audience of Jewish believers living in the Diaspora in the mid-first century. To these believers, John says that Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross was a payment not only for them but for the &ldquo;whole world,&rdquo; meaning for all kinds of men (i.e., Jew &amp; Gentile), in all places and throughout all history. The Lord was dying for the sins of humanity, not just to save the Jews of the first century.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>John&#39;s comment is similar to the statements of other writers of the New Testament when they say:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 6:10&nbsp;For&nbsp;the death that He died, He died to sin&nbsp;once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God.</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 7:26&nbsp; For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens;<br />\nHeb. 7:27&nbsp;who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.<br />\nHeb. 9:11&nbsp; But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;<br />\nHeb. 9:12&nbsp;and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.</h5>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 3:18&nbsp;For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;</h5>\n\n<p>In all these passages, the author is speaking of the sufficiency of Christ&rsquo;s atoning work. His death is a once-for-all sacrifice sufficient to enact the Father&rsquo;s plan of salvation such that no additional sacrifice is needed. No additional Messiah is required. Jesus did all the work needed.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, these statements do NOT mean that the payment of Christ on the cross was applied to the sins of all humanity nor that all people will ultimately benefit from it. As John himself says:</p>\n\n<h5>John 3:17&nbsp;&ldquo;For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.<br />\nJohn 3:18&nbsp;&ldquo;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</h5>\n\n<p>Notice, those&nbsp;who do not believe are showing evidence they were &ldquo;judged already&rdquo; because they did not believe. Men are born sinners, and therefore all human beings are due judgment from birth. As Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 3:10 &nbsp;as it is written,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;There is none righteous, not even one;<br />\nRom. 3:11 &nbsp;There is none who understands,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is none who seeks for God;<br />\nRom. 3:12 All have turned aside, together they have become useless;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is none who does good,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is not even one.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>As someone once said, we are not sinners because we sin. We sin because we are born sinners. Therefore, all men are due judgment for their sin nature from birth, not for some specific sinful decision or action during their life.&nbsp;Those who fail to place their trust in Christ will be judged for their sin nature and the life of sin that resulted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As John himself writes in Revelation:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 20:11&nbsp; Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.<br />\nRev. 20:12&nbsp;And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.<br />\nRev. 20:13&nbsp;And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.<br />\nRev. 20:14&nbsp;Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.<br />\nRev. 20:15&nbsp;And if anyone&rsquo;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.</h5>\n\n<p>At the judgment, the world of unbelievers will be called to account. They will not be judged for a specific sin of rejecting Christ. In fact, many of these will never have even heard the name Jesus or been exposed to the Gospel. Millions die every day&nbsp;who have never heard the name Jesus. Nevertheless, they will be rightly judged at the Great White Throne since they are sinners by nature and are due the penalty of sin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Only by God&rsquo;s grace may a person come to trust in God&rsquo;s propitiation in Christ and be saved from the penalty of their sin. The sacrifice of Christ on the cross is the once-for-all payment for the whole world, but the effective application of His payment requires God&rsquo;s grace to bring a man or woman to trust in that payment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the unforgivable sin, please read <a href=\"/bible-answers/what-is-the-unforgivable-sin\">our article</a> on this important question.</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Did God forbid&nbsp;interracial marriage? Didn&#39;t God make different races for a purpose?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a> defines the concept of race as&nbsp;the classification of humans into groups based on physical traits, ancestry, genetics or social relations, or the relations between them. In other words, the concept of &ldquo;race&rdquo; is a&nbsp;man-made concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In other words, <u>there is no objective, scientific standard for defining a \"race\" of humanity</u>, because the standards we use to classify a certain race are arbitrary.&nbsp;In fact, it&rsquo;s scientifically impossible for a doctor or scientist to identify a person&#39;s &ldquo;race&rdquo; solely by examining that person&#39;s DNA (i.e., there is no such thing as \"black\" DNA or \"white\" DNA, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Within normal human DNA, God has prepared the diversity of physical traits we see within the human population on earth today. Every physical trait&nbsp;of human beings (e.g., our skin&nbsp;darkness, our facial features, our hair type, our height, etc.) varies along a spectrum of diversity. Therefore, science cannot&nbsp;identify &ndash; much less define &ndash; a clear-cut delineation&nbsp;between one \"race\" and another. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we only find&nbsp;gradual shifts in&nbsp;human traits between various populations of people in the world, and these differences cluster according to geography and family relationships based on migration and marriage patterns. For example, human DNA supports a&nbsp;wide range of skin color and these variations cluster by geography. Populations living in hotter climates with greater exposure to the sun tend to exhibit greater concentrations of skin pigment, while populations living&nbsp;in cooler climates develop less.</p>\n\n<p>Such variations are a result of the normal programming found in every human being&#39;s DNA, and therefore these differences are meaningless apart from whatever arbitrary meaning we may choose&nbsp;to assign to them. By definition, assigning human beings to a racial group is not only subjective, it is inherently biased. No wonder&nbsp;sinful humanity has favored the use of racial labels to discriminate and oppress those perceived to be&nbsp;the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Greeks have oppressed Turks, Indians have oppressed Pakistanis, Europeans have oppressed Asians, men have oppressed women, the healthy have oppressed the sick, the strong have oppressed the weak, and of course in American society, Caucasians have historically oppressed non-Caucasians.</p>\n\n<p>In each of these cases, sinful hearts used arbitrary physical distinctions as justification for cruelty against others, <u>and any such hatred or prejudice is sinful and unbiblical</u>. Such sinful attitudes and behaviors have no place in the life of a Christian&nbsp;for they are neither loving nor godly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is especially true for the believer who understands the Creation account in Genesis, since that account reminds us that all humanity descends from the same parents, as we read in Acts:</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 17:24&nbsp;&ldquo;The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;<br />\nActs 17:25&nbsp;nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things;<br />\nActs 17:26&nbsp;and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,</h5>\n\n<p>This single passage from the Bible renders the&nbsp;term \"race\" meaningless, since if all humanity descended from one man, then what is a&nbsp;<em>race</em>? Once a Christian understands all humanity descended from the same two parents, then we must abandon any belief in race as a meaningful distinction between people (much less view race as just cause for discrimination).</p>\n\n<p>Whatever physical differences may exist between any two people on earth, those differences are&nbsp;no more meaningful than the differences between a brother and sister from the same nuclear family. We are all literally from one family, the Bible says.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it is both illogical and unbiblical for a Christian to hold prejudice against another person because of a difference in physical features (e.g., skin color). Any Christian harboring hateful or discriminatory thoughts toward another person for any reason is sinning and should repent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We must love everyone, even those we perceive to be our enemies, as Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 5:43&nbsp; &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 5:44&nbsp;&ldquo;But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,<br />\nMatt. 5:45&nbsp;so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.<br />\nMatt. 5:46&nbsp;&ldquo;For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?<br />\nMatt. 5:47&nbsp;&ldquo;If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?<br />\nMatt. 5:48&nbsp;&ldquo;Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</h5>\n\n<p>Consequently, we can find nothing in the Bible concerning interracial marriage, because in reality <u>there is no such thing as \"race\" from God&rsquo;s point of view</u>. All humanity is the same, and therefore a marriage union is possible between any man and any woman, since the physical traits of the two are completely irrelevant to the question of marriage.</p>\n\n<p>(We should add that <a href=\"/bible-answers/can_a_believer_marry_or_date_a_non_believer\">the Bible does require</a> a believer to&nbsp;marry only another believer.)</p>"

When a man divorces a wife, he puts an end to the marriage relationship. Nevertheless, the two remain one-flesh, according to scripture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We could make an analogy using an example of giving a child up for adoption. When a mother gives up her child for adoption, she is no longer considered the child&#39;s parent. Another woman will become the child&#39;s mother. Nevertheless, the woman remains the child&#39;s biological mother. The two will share a lifelong bond in the flesh (i.e., physically) that can never be broken. The child&#39;s physical relationship to the biological mother persists despite the child having been given to another family.</p>\n\n<p>Spiritually speaking, marriage creates a similar life-long relationship. A man and woman form a \"one-flesh\" relationship through marriage, Jesus says. This bond cannot be undone except by death (see Romans 7). When a man chooses to&nbsp;divorce his wife (<a href=\"/bible-answers/can-a-believer-divorce-or-remarry\">which is </a><a href=\"/bible-answers/can-a-believer-divorce-or-remarry\">sin</a>), he puts an end to the institution of marriage, but he cannot end their one-flesh relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, if&nbsp;that man divorces his wife, he is no longer husband to the woman. Like a woman who relinquishes her right to be mother over a child given up&nbsp;for adoption, the husband has relinquished his right to be&nbsp;husband to his wife. Nevertheless, he does not&nbsp;end the one-flesh relationship, which&nbsp;is a life-long bond, so he may never marry again without committing adultery.&nbsp;While the two are no longer married, neither are they free to remarry, Jesus says, because remarriage results in the sin of&nbsp;adultery.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore,&nbsp;a man who divorces his wife and remarries is not married to two women. He is married only to his second wife, yet he is also guilty of adultery in having taken the second wife.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more information on this difficult topic, please read <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/does_a_divorced_and_remarried_christian_commit_continuous_sin\">the following article</a></strong>.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

Is it Biblical?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A: Regarding the question of &ldquo;closed&rdquo; or &ldquo;open&rdquo; communion, these terms have different meanings in different churches. Some churches&nbsp;restrict participation in the communion ordinance only to those who are professing Christians, while others may go further by requiring church membership or water baptism. On the other hand, some churches permit anyone to partake of communion without restriction.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nBiblically speaking, the only requirement for partaking in communion is faith in Jesus Christ only. Communion was given by Christ to the Church, and therefore It is never appropriate for an unbeliever to partake of the communion meal. The ritual is a picture of the body of Christ united in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ by the sacrifice of His body and the spilling of His blood for the remission of sins. Unbelievers have no part in these things.&nbsp;<br />\n&#8203;<br />\nJesus Himself modeled this restriction at the first communion meal (i.e., the Last Supper) when He dismissed the only unbeliever at the table, Judas, prior to the meal:</p>\n\n<h5>John 13:26&nbsp;Jesus then&nbsp;&nbsp;answered, &ldquo;That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him.&rdquo; So when He had dipped the morsel, He&nbsp;&nbsp;took and&nbsp;&nbsp;gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.<br />\nJohn 13:27&nbsp;After the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;said to him, &ldquo;What you do, do quickly.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 13:28&nbsp;Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him.<br />\nJohn 13:29&nbsp;For some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, &ldquo;Buy the things we have need of for the feast&rdquo;; or else, that he should give something to the poor.<br />\nJohn 13:30&nbsp;So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately, and it was night.</h5>\n\n<p>Judas was not included in the first communion meal since he was not a believer.&nbsp;Likewise, we must instruct those who have not yet placed their faith in Jesus Christ to abstain from participation in the communion meal. VBVMI also supports the&nbsp;practice of limiting the communion meal to believers who have consented to water baptism as a sign of their faith in Jesus Christ (though there is no specific biblical&nbsp;requirement to do so).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more information on the meaning and biblical practice of the communion meal, please listen to <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-studies/first_corinthians\" target=\"_blank\">Lesson 11B from our 1Corinthians study</a>.</p>"

Angels are ministering spirits created to serve believers in Jesus Christ, as the writer of Hebrews says:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 1:13&nbsp; But to which of the angels has He ever said,&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;Sit at My right hand,&nbsp;<br />\nUntil I make Your enemies&nbsp;<br />\nA footstool for Your feet&rdquo;?<br />\nHeb. 1:14&nbsp;Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?</h5>\n\n<p>Angels were created by God, including an angel called Lucifer, who was the greatest of all angels:</p>\n\n<h5>Ezek. 28:12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre and say to him, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord God,&nbsp;<br />\n&ldquo;You had the seal of perfection,&nbsp;<br />\nFull of wisdom and perfect in beauty.<br />\nEzek. 28:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You were in Eden, the garden of God;&nbsp;<br />\nEvery precious stone was your covering:&nbsp;<br />\nThe ruby, the topaz and the diamond;&nbsp;<br />\nThe beryl, the onyx and the jasper;&nbsp;<br />\nThe lapis lazuli, the turquoise and the emerald;&nbsp;<br />\nAnd the gold, the workmanship of your settings and sockets,&nbsp;<br />\nWas in you.&nbsp;<br />\nOn the day that you were created&nbsp;<br />\nThey were prepared.<br />\nEzek. 28:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You were the anointed cherub who covers,&nbsp;<br />\nAnd I placed you there.&nbsp;<br />\nYou were on the holy mountain of God;&nbsp;<br />\nYou walked in the midst of the stones of fire.<br />\nEzek. 28:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You were blameless in your ways&nbsp;<br />\nFrom the day you were created&nbsp;<br />\nUntil unrighteousness was found in you.</h5>\n\n<p>Lucifer (Satan) fell into sin because of his pride, and as a result, he brought down a third of the angels with him, as described in Revelation 12:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 12:3&nbsp;Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.<br />\nRev. 12:4&nbsp;And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.<br />\nRev. 12:5&nbsp;And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.<br />\nRev. 12:6&nbsp;Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared by God so that there she would be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.<br />\nRev. 12:7&nbsp; And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war,<br />\nRev. 12:8&nbsp;and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.<br />\nRev. 12:9&nbsp;And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.</h5>\n\n<p>Notice the dragon (Satan) recruited a third of the angelic realm to join him in rebelling against the Lord. This third of the angelic realm are called demons. Demons are fallen angels, which move between heaven and earth doing the bidding of the enemy. Demons may bring torment to believers and unbelievers, and they may indwell unbelievers as shown in the Gospels.&nbsp;<br />\nAt the end of this age, demons and Satan are bound and kept in the abyss during the kingdom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 20:1&nbsp; Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.<br />\nRev. 20:2&nbsp;And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;<br />\nRev. 20:3&nbsp;and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him so that he would not deceive the nations any longer until the thousand years were completed; after these things, he must be released for a short time.</h5>\n\n<p>At the end of the 1,000 Kingdom, the enemy is allowed a short time once more to work in the hearts of men on earth. At the end of that time, the Lord will judge Satan and cast him into the Lake of Fire forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rev. 20:10&nbsp;And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more information on these matters, we recommend you listen to our <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation Bible study</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p>Q: What does it mean&nbsp;to pray without ceasing?</p>\n\n<p>A: Paul tells the Church to pray without ceasing as part of a concluding series of statements in his first letter to Thessalonica:</p>\n\n<h5>1Th. 5:14&nbsp;We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.<br />\n1Th. 5:15&nbsp;See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all people.<br />\n1Th. 5:16&nbsp;Rejoice always;<br />\n1Th. 5:17&nbsp;pray without ceasing;<br />\n1Th. 5:18&nbsp;in everything give thanks; for this is God&rsquo;s will for you in Christ Jesus.<br />\n1Th. 5:19&nbsp;Do not quench the Spirit;<br />\n1Th. 5:20&nbsp;do not despise prophetic utterances.<br />\n1Th. 5:21&nbsp;But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good;<br />\n1Th. 5:22&nbsp;abstain from every form of evil.</h5>\n\n<p>Paul is arguing for godliness and self-restraint among the people of God. At the time Paul wrote his letter, the church was enduring persecution and great tribulation in their day. These tests led some to become anxious, impatient and even hurtful to one another in the body of Christ.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPaul admonished the church to restrain these sinful responses to trial and reply on the Spirit to ease their worries, strengthen their resolves and guide their understanding. Key among his instructions was to pray without ceasing in v.17. When a believer faces difficulty and trial, the tendency can to be retreat from our disciplines of faith and move to action. We take matters into our own hands rather than waiting patiently on the Lord to address our needs.<br />\n<br />\nPaul says godliness and spiritual maturity demands that we seek the Lord&rsquo;s counsel in prayer while giving thanks for God&rsquo;s will in our life. To pray without ceasing means to seek His will in everything we experience, not simply when we want something from Him or wish to thank Him for His gifts.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPrayer must be a daily means of working with the Lord to know His will and to do it.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Jesus told Peter in Matthew 16 that upon this rock, He would build His church. What is the \"rock?\"</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A; &nbsp;Jesus made His declaration to Peter in Matthew 16:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 16:15&nbsp;He&nbsp; said to them, &ldquo;But who do you say that I am?&rdquo;<br />\nMatt. 16:16&nbsp;Simon Peter answered, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo;<br />\nMatt. 16:17&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven.<br />\nMatt. 16:18&nbsp;&ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.<br />\nMatt. 16:19&nbsp;&ldquo;I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>In response to Jesus&rsquo; question, Peter declared that Jesus was the Son of God, the Messiah. Jesus replied that Peter&rsquo;s confession of faith was the result of the Father in heaven granting Peter this insight. Next, Jesus declares that Peter (which is Cephas in Aramaic) would be the rock upon which Jesus would build His church.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus made a play on words as He renamed Simon. The&nbsp;name&nbsp;Peter in Greek is the word <em>petros</em>&nbsp;(in Aramaic, the word&nbsp;<em>cephas</em>),&nbsp;which means a stone or boulder. Later when Jesus said He would build His church on the \"rock,\" He used a different Greek word <em>petra</em>, which refers to a large rock (as in a mountain cliff). Given Jesus&#39; choice of two different Greek words for rock and the overall context of the passage, we must conclude Jesus was addressing two different aspects of building His church.</p>\n\n<p>First, Peter&rsquo;s declaration of&nbsp;faith in Christ was to be&nbsp;the model for how the body of Christ would grow. The church body would be a \"building\" &nbsp;consisting of men and women who followed in Peter&rsquo;s footsteps repeating his declaration of faith in Jesus. Jesus is the Cornerstone of the church, and all believers are the \"living stones\" who place their faith in Him (<em>see 1Peter 2:5</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Jesus renamed Simon with the name Peter (i.e., stone) to indicate that Peter would play a&nbsp;unique role in the founding of the church.&nbsp;Jesus declared that Peter would possess the &ldquo;keys&rdquo; to the kingdom, and what Peter \"bound\" or \"loosed\" on earth would be confirmed in Heaven. Historically, the Catholic Church has used this verse to support the legitimacy of the papacy, while Protestants have categorically rejected the idea that Peter held special authority over the early church. The truth lies between these two extremes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to Matthew 16, Christ did assign Peter&nbsp;special authority in the early church (i.e., the \"keys\") to open the Gospel to three&nbsp;people groups so they might receive the Holy Spirit and enter the body of Christ. Peter fulfilled this commission in three steps as recorded in the book of Acts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, in Acts 2 Peter unlocked the Gospel for the Jewish people at Pentecost. Peter preached the Good News, and as a result the Jewish people gathered on that feast day began to receive the Gospel in Jerusalem and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>The visible evidence of Peter &ldquo;turning\" a key of the kingdom was the arrival of the Holy Spirit followed by visible manifestations of the Spirit among a new group of humanity. At Pentecost the first group to receive the Holy Spirit were Jews, and once that key was turned by Peter, the Gospel remained forever open to Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Next, Peter unlocked the Gospel for the Samaritan people in Acts 8.</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 8:14 &nbsp;Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,<br />\nActs 8:15 who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.<br />\nActs 8:16 For He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.<br />\nActs 8:17 Then they began laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.</h5>\n\n<p>Faith first came to the Samaritans through Philip, but the Holy Spirit&#39;s arrival awaited Peter&#39;s \"turning of the key.\" When Peter arrived in Samaria to confirm the acceptance of the Gospel among the Samaritan people, he laid&nbsp;hands on the new believers and they received the Holy Spirit. This was Peter&#39;s turning of the second key of the kingdom. Notice that Peter&rsquo;s presence was required before the Lord began the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (the mark of the Church saint) among Samaritans. What Peter \"loosed\" on Earth was loosed in Heaven.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Peter opened the door for Gentiles to receive the Gospel in Acts 10.</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 10:34 &nbsp;Opening his mouth, Peter said: &nbsp;&ldquo;I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality,<br />\nActs 10:35 but in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right is welcome to Him.<br />\nActs 10:36 &ldquo;The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all) &mdash;<br />\nActs 10:37 you yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism which John proclaimed.<br />\nActs 10:38 &ldquo;You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.<br />\nActs 10:39 &ldquo;We are witnesses of all the things He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross.<br />\nActs 10:40 &ldquo;God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He become visible,<br />\nActs 10:41 not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen beforehand by God, that is, to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.<br />\nActs 10:42 &ldquo;And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead.<br />\nActs 10:43 &ldquo;Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.&rdquo;<br />\nActs 10:44 &nbsp;While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message.<br />\nActs 10:45 All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also.<br />\nActs 10:46 For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered,<br />\nActs 10:47 &ldquo;Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?&rdquo;<br />\nActs 10:48 And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.</h5>\n\n<p>When Cornelius and his family received the Gospel, Peter was God&#39;s instrument to deliver the Holy Spirit again in keeping with the role Jesus assigned to him. After Peter &ldquo;turned\" this final key, the family of Cornelius received the Holy Spirit and began to manifest His presence as was seen earlier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Once the Gentiles received the Gospel, Peter had turned his final key. No more keys exist, since the kingdom is now open to all groups of humanity (i.e., Jew, Samaritan, and Gentile). Having fulfilled his mission to open the kingdom, Peter then disappears from the record of Acts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In summary, Peter was the &ldquo;rock&rdquo; upon whom Jesus built the church both by his example of faith and through his personal authority to open the Gospel to the three groups of humanity. Once Peter turned the keys, he was no longer the &ldquo;rock&rdquo; for he had met his purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Scripture does&nbsp;not support the view of the Catholic Church, which holds that Jesus&rsquo; words established the papacy with Peter as the first pope. The institution of the papacy was asserted by the Catholic Church several hundred years after Christ&rsquo;s death to&nbsp;further the church&#39;s political power in the face of a declining Roman Empire. Peter himself never assumed such a title or position&nbsp;nor did later church&nbsp;leaders during the&nbsp;three centuries following Peter.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the authority of the papacy is historically and biblically illegitimate, and certainly nothing in Jesus&#39; statement to Peter in Matthew 16 lends support to the Catholic position. Jesus was referring only to Peter&#39;s unique role in moving the Gospel outward during Peter&#39;s lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on the keys of Kingdom, we encourage you to listen to our entire <a href=\"/bible-studies/acts_of_the_apostles\">Acts Bible study</a>:</p>"

Notice the context:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 6:14&nbsp;&ldquo;For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.<br />\nMatt. 6:15&nbsp;&ldquo;But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.</h5>\n\n<p>Jesus said if we forgive someone, then the Lord will forgive us. Jesus equates the two types of forgiveness. God&#39;s&nbsp;forgiveness of us is contingent on our forgiving others. As we try to understand Jesus&#39; words, we must first remember that we have no power over the eternal fate of another person, for Christ alone is our Judge:</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 10:42&nbsp;&ldquo;And He ordered us to preach to the people, and solemnly to testify that this is the One who has been appointed by God as&nbsp;Judge&nbsp;of the living and the dead.</h5>\n\n<p>We know Jesus wasn&#39;t asking us to forgive someone from the penalty of their sin in eternity for only God can do that. The only kind of forgiveness we can extend to another person is the restoration of our earthly fellowship with that person. So when Jesus asks us to forgive another, He must be speaking in terms of earthly relationships, not eternal&nbsp;outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>If a believer forgives in this way, Jesus says God will forgive us. From the context, the proper interpretation&nbsp;is that God will forgive us in the <em><strong>same</strong></em> way&nbsp;He asks us to&nbsp;forgive others: by restoring fellowship with us. Once again, Jesus is speaking in terms of earth consequences and earthly forgiveness. The Lord will forgive us from the earthly consequences of our sins provided we are willing to show forgiveness to others (which is a part of our mission to show the love of Christ to the world).</p>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches that our sins after faith may still bring us earthly consequences. The Lord may choose to bring&nbsp;discipline against us for our sin, which the Bible calls the discipline of the Lord. Discipline is intended by God to drive&nbsp;us back into a godly walk with Him:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 12:7&nbsp;It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?<br />\nHeb. 12:8&nbsp;But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.<br />\nHeb. 12:9&nbsp;Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?<br />\nHeb. 12:10&nbsp;For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.<br />\nHeb. 12:11&nbsp;All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.</h5>\n\n<p>The means of obtaining&nbsp;earthly relief from the Lord&#39;s discipline is confessing our sins and seeking the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness, which the Lord will grant us as John promises:</p>\n\n<h5>1John 1:9&nbsp;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</h5>\n\n<p>When we repent and confess our sins (as a believer), the Lord will grant us relief from His discipline, but Jesus says in Matthew 6&nbsp;that if a believer is so hardhearted that he or she withholds forgiveness in earthly relationships, then the Lord will withhold His forgiveness for that person&#39;s sins as well, which means the Lord will visit&nbsp;earthly discipline against such a hardhearted believer.</p>\n\n<p>The believer&#39;s eternal salvation is not impacted, for Jesus isn&rsquo;t speaking of the eternal forgiveness that comes by faith alone, nor is Jesus giving the Church a recipe for maintaining our salvation, for&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-answers/can_someone_continue_in_sin_and_still_be_saved\">no believer can sin his or her way out of salvation</a>.&nbsp;God&rsquo;s grace is greater than our sin:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 5:20&nbsp;The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,<br />\nRom. 5:21&nbsp;so that, as sin reigned in death, even&nbsp;so&nbsp;grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</h5>\n\n<p>The believer is forever forgiven the eternal consequences of sin (i.e., the Second Death) from the moment of his or her faith in Jesus Christ, and this can never change.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Jesus is speaking about earthly relationships and earthly consequences. If we desire the Lord to forgive us of our daily missteps and to withhold&nbsp;His discipline, we must be prepared to extend our forgiveness to others for their missteps against us.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: I read in 1Timothy 5:8 that a believer who fails to care for his family is worse than an unbeliever. Exactly what obligations does a believer have to provide financially?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;While our ministry does not offer personal counseling or advice, we can explain the meaning of 1Tim 5:8. When seeking to interpret scripture, it&rsquo;s important to understand the text in its proper context. The full context of 1Timothy 5:8 is:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 5:3&nbsp; Honor widows who are widows indeed;<br />\n1Tim. 5:4&nbsp;but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.<br />\n1Tim. 5:5&nbsp;Now she who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone, has fixed her hope on God and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.<br />\n1Tim. 5:6&nbsp;But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even while she lives.<br />\n1Tim. 5:7&nbsp;Prescribe these things as well, so that they may be above reproach.<br />\n1Tim. 5:8&nbsp;But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</h5>\n\n<p>In this passage, Paul gives the church a test for how to care for the weak and vulnerable within the body. In particular, Paul is focused on the needs of widows within the body of Christ. Widows in Paul&rsquo;s day were especially vulnerable since they generally lacked income and could not possess property. The church body often came to the rescue of needy Christians, including widows, which is what the Lord intended.</p>\n\n<p>Still, such charity must be applied in the right ways to prevent abuse, so Paul sets standards or tests for whether the body of Christ should provide financial support to a widow within the congregation. First, Paul says the church must ask if the widow has immediate family that can provide support to her. If so, then the widow&#39;s family must assume responsibility for her care before seeking assistance from the church body.</p>\n\n<p>In Paul&rsquo;s day there was no state welfare for the needy, so if a family could not care for a widow, their relative would be doomed to a life of poverty and likely death. Such neglect was considered a disgrace in Paul&#39;s day, so few if any families dared to be so cruel. Believers, on the other hand, had the church body to lean on for financial support in hard times, so if a family couldn&rsquo;t afford to support a widow,&nbsp;the church might step into the gap. The church saw an opportunity to witness to the Lord of Christ by providing support to a believing widow rather than allowing a sister in the Lord to suffer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, some believing families in Paul&rsquo;s day were neglecting this responsibility to care for&nbsp;widows out a selfish desire to protect their own wealth. These families had the means to support their widows, yet they refused to do so&nbsp;expecting the church to provide for the widow instead. This is why Paul says such families were worse than unbelieving families. They weren&rsquo;t willing to show the same common decency, love and selflessness that even unbelievers were willing to demonstrate for their families.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Paul says if a widow is to receive support from the church body, the widow must be in good standing in the church body. If she is not living in a godly manner, than she has no right to expect the hard-working members of the body of Christ to sacrifice for her sake. This test of behavior is appropriate, since a church body would deeply resent being called to obey Christ by sacrificing to support a woman who was not herself seeking to be obedient to Christ.</p>\n\n<p>What do we conclude from Paul&rsquo;s teaching? In short, Christians must not neglect customary personal responsibilities even in cases where the church body is prepared to assume that responsibility for them. For example, if a Christian widow can afford to pay her bills, then she must do so. If a Christian&nbsp;retiree possess the ability to mow his own lawn, clean her own house, or do his own shopping, etc., then he or she should not lay those burdens on the church body instead.</p>\n\n<p>The Lord has joined us to a church body so that we may serve and be served at times, but we must not abuse that relationship for our own advantage.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Paul says in 1Timothy 2:15 that a Christian woman can be saved by bearing chidlren. How can this be true?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;That verse puzzles many people, because we lack an appreciation for the context of Paul&#39;s statement and because we judge Paul&rsquo;s words by modern attitudes toward the role of women.</p>\n\n<p>The verse reads in context:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 2:8&nbsp; Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and dissension.<br />\n1Tim. 2:9&nbsp;Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments,<br />\n1Tim. 2:10&nbsp;but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness.<br />\n1Tim. 2:11&nbsp;A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.<br />\n1Tim. 2:12&nbsp;But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.<br />\n1Tim. 2:13&nbsp;For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve.<br />\n1Tim. 2:14&nbsp;And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression.<br />\n1Tim. 2:15&nbsp;But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.</h5>\n\n<p>First, notice the context. Paul is explaining the unique opportunities Christian men and women have for performing good works to &ldquo;make a claim to godliness\" (v.10). Godliness means displaying piety, so a claim to godliness refers to an outward display of our spiritual life&nbsp;intended to be noticed by the unbelieving world. In other words, God has ordained &ldquo;proper&rdquo; ways (i.e., ways that befit each gender) for men and women to reflect their godliness to the unsaved world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, these good works must be countercultural (i.e., opposite from the world&#39;s ways) if they are to serve as an effective witness to the world. So Paul prescibes ways that men and women in the Church may behave to gain attention for the Gospel and for their relationship with the Lord. These behaviors are designed to reflects God&rsquo;s word while repudiating the world&rsquo;s thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Turning to the instructions Paul gives to men, he wants men to gather in &ldquo;every place&rdquo; praying and lifting up holy hands without wrath or dissension. In the unsaved world (especially in Paul&rsquo;s day), a large gathering of men anywhere in a city (apart from a work setting) was usually an occasion for trouble. Men would gather to commit lawlessness, immorality or for other conflict. Consequently, large gatherings of men were often outlawed or at least viewed with concern.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to the world, Paul says Christian men should gather in every place with &ldquo;holy hands,&rdquo; which means gathering without sinful intentions and with a holy purpose. Furthermore, they must not come together for the purpose of wrath or dissension, which is the world&rsquo;s pattern. Instead, Christian men will come together to pray.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, such a gathering would be very countercultural. Imagine a large group of Christian men gathering on a street corner or in a marketplace praying together in unity. Observers would be amazed at the sight, and such a display could be used by God as a witness opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Turning to the women, Paul says&nbsp;Christian women should resist the worldly temptation to draw attention to themselves by adorning themselves in costly or excessive ways.&nbsp;From the dawn of time, women have adorned themselves&nbsp;in the hope of gaining the interest of a man or perhaps provoking jealousy in another woman. While men&nbsp;do similar things at times, the tendency toward excessive outward adornment is far more common among women. Ironically, such outward displays of beauty may conceal a&nbsp;heart of darkness.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Paul asks Christian women&nbsp;to set a countercultural example by rejecting the world&rsquo;s approach to beauty. Instead of favoring outward adornment over inward godliness, Christian women should dress modestly (though not necessarily in unflattering ways), while displaying&nbsp;inward godliness.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Christian women should receive instruction from church authorities&nbsp;with submissiveness. Here again, this is a countercultural behavior. Women generally do not view submission to male authority (in any context) to be necessary or desirable, and certainly the Bible does <strong>not</strong> require women to submit to men in all situations. In fact,&nbsp;Christians should champion&nbsp;the fair and equal treatment of women in every circumstance, including in the home, church and society. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s word specifically directs that men shall exercise authority over the family and over the body of Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Christian women are called to respect the authority of fathers and husbands in the home&nbsp;and of the male leaders in the church. Paul says women may not exercise authority over a man nor teach a man in the church, but rather they must receive instruction with &ldquo;entire&rdquo; submissiveness. Again, this behavior is the proper (i.e., fitting) countercultural way for Christian women to witness before the world.</p>\n\n<p>When a woman submits willingly to a husband and to leaders in the church, she will draw the interest of unbelieving female friends and neighbors, who&nbsp;generally reject&nbsp;male headship in any context&nbsp;believing submission to be offensive. Certainly, we can understand why this particular type of witness&nbsp;is \"fitting\" for Christian women, since it clearly goes against&nbsp;cultural expectations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, when a Christian woman lives in this way, Paul says she witnesses to the truth of Genesis 3. In Genesis 3,&nbsp;Woman was deceived by Satan&nbsp;because she was vulnerable &nbsp;without the support and leadership of her husband. As a result, the Lord instituted male headship in the home and church as a defense against the enemy and as a memorial of the Fall. Christian women now witness to this truth in a countercultural way when they act in obedience to the word of God by submitting to male headship in the home and church.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Some women in the church may feel that forgoing leadership and teaching opportunities in the church leaves them with no opportunities to contribute to the work of the kingdom. Of course, this is not true as women have many ways to contribute apart from leading or teaching men. Nevertheless, to&nbsp;address these concerns&nbsp;Paul ends in v.15 by reminding women of a particularly unique way in which they contribute to the work of the Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Paul says that women may be be &ldquo;preserved&rdquo; by child bearing. The word for preserved in Greek is <em>sozo</em>, which has a wide variety of meanings. The word can be used in the soteriological sense of salvation, but clearly in this context Paul is not talking about&nbsp;how a Christian woman can be saved from eternal punishment. So how is a woman preserved or saved by bearing children?</p>\n\n<p>Given the context of this passage, preserved must refer to preserving her testimony of godliness. Once again, Paul is emphasizing a countercultural way a Christian woman can testify&nbsp;to the world through her Christian lifestyle. Rather than challenging her husband&#39;s authority or the authority of men in the church (which would damage her testimony of godliness), a Christian woman may preserve her testimony before the world&nbsp;by raising children who exhibit faith, love, sanctity (i.e., holiness) and self-restraint. These adjectives refer to the children&#39;s behavior, not to the woman&#39;s behavior, and therefore it&#39;s easy to see how bearing children with such qualities&nbsp;would preserve&nbsp;a Christian woman&#39;s testimony.</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, there is no more powerful testimony of godliness for a Christian woman than the legacy of children who exhibit godliness themselves. In fact, raising godly children for the body of Christ is the single most important (and unique) contribution any woman can make for the Kingdom, since women alone&nbsp;bear children. Not only are godly children&nbsp;a powerful testimony to a world raising ungodly children, but they hold tremendous potential for impacting&nbsp;the kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>A Christian woman will only achieve so much for the kingdom in her own lifetime, yet imagine how much more she can accomplish through the godly lives of her children? A legacy of godly children&nbsp;can be a significant part&nbsp;of any Christian woman&#39;s testimony, while it also serves as a countercultural witness to the fallen world. Therefore, the Christian woman who accepts her God-given place in the home and church&nbsp;living a quiet life, obeying and submitting to her husband and to the leadership of the church, while raising a family of faithful, loving, self-restrained and godly children is preserving a great testimony of Christ to the world.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;What is the meaning of&nbsp;&ldquo;faith without works is dead&rdquo;?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A: In the second chapter of James&rsquo; letter, He writes:</p>\n\n<h5>James 2:20&nbsp;But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:21&nbsp;Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:22&nbsp;You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected;&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:23&nbsp;and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &ldquo;And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,&rdquo; and he was called the friend of God.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:24&nbsp;You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:25&nbsp;In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:26&nbsp;For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice in v.20 James declares that a life of faith absent good works is &ldquo;useless.&rdquo; He then cites the example of Abraham. Abraham was declared righteous by faith in chapter 15 of Genesis, but he did no good work in keeping with his faith until chapter 22, when he attempted to sacrifice his son Isaac as God required.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We know that Abraham was saved by his faith alone in chapter 15 (as Paul confirms in Romans 4), and yet James says Abraham needed to perform the good works of chapter 22 before scripture was &ldquo;fulfilled\" in his life. James&rsquo; point is subtle and easy to miss, but Abraham&rsquo;s example helps to ground and guide our interpretation. Whatever James is saying about faith and works must be consistent with what we know to be true for Abraham.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What do we know about Abraham? Was he declared to be righteous by doing good works? No, for Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 4:2&nbsp;For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 4:3&nbsp;For what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, we know James was not saying that Abraham was made righteous by his good works. He was righteous by his faith alone.&nbsp;<br />\nFurthermore, Abraham was declared righteous in chapter 15. Are we to conclude that Abraham was somehow less &ldquo;saved\" prior to his good works in chapter 22? In other words, is James saying that until Abraham did good works his confession of faith was invalid or inadequate?</p>\n\n<p>Once again, the answer must be no, because Paul quotes from Genesis 15 in Romans 4 when he says that Abraham was righteous by faith. Consequently, Abraham was no less righteous in Genesis 15 than he was in Genesis 22. So now we know that Abraham was saved by faith alone well before he did good works, so what was James&rsquo; point in referencing Abrahams good works&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>His point was that until Abraham did the good works that his faith expected, Abraham had yet to fulfill his purpose in being made righteous by God. In the years between Genesis 15 and Genesis 22, Abraham made many mistakes and acted in ways that were contrary to his faith. He lied about his wife and agreed to marry a concubine to make an heir. These were not actions consistent with faith.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>James says in v.23 that scripture was &ldquo;fulfilled\" when Abraham obeyed God in Genesis 22. James means that God&rsquo;s declaration that Abraham was righteous in Genesis 15 was fulfilled in his actions in Genesis 22. What was already true in Heaven in Genesis 15 (i.e., that Abraham was justified by faith) became evident on earth in Genesis 22 when Abraham acted in righteous ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>James&rsquo; message to the believer is that we are saved for the purpose of doing good works, but if we fail to pursue good works, our faith is useless to God and to us. That faith is no less real, and therefore we are no less saved, but we will not have fulfilled (i.e., lived up to) the righteousness we have been given by our faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s the meaning of v.22 when James says that faith is &ldquo;perfected&rdquo; by our works. In this context, perfected means to fulfill its purpose in our life. God has granted us faith in His Son so that we would be saved and so that we might bring Him glory by our good works, as Jesus says:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 5:16&nbsp;&ldquo;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your&nbsp;good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</h5>\n\n<p>When we do the good works expected of us, we perfect or fulfill the purpose of our faith in God&rsquo;s plan. When we fail to accomplish the good works God intends, our faith still saves us yet it is useless otherwise. Earlier in James 2 the writer says:</p>\n\n<h5>James 2:17&nbsp;Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Once again, James acknowledges the presence of faith in the believer. He says that faith is by itself, not invalid or absent. Nevertheless, James says it is &ldquo;dead&rdquo; because it exists without works which denies faith its purpose in glorifying God. In this context the word dead means faith that is like a corpse in that it lacks activity or energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>James does not mean that the faith is false or nonexistent. Once again, whatever is true for Abraham must be true for us. Was Abraham&rsquo;s faith nonexistent prior to his good works in Genesis 22? No, and therefore we must make the same conclusion concerning the believer today who has placed faith in Christ but has not yet perfected his faith (i.e., produced the good works expected by God).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That is James&rsquo; chief concern for the church, that believers would live according to their faith so as to produce good works. Earlier in the chapter, James had chastised the church for failing to show charity to fellow believers:</p>\n\n<h5>James 2:14&nbsp; What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him?&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:15&nbsp;If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:16&nbsp;and one of you says to them, &ldquo;Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,&rdquo; and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In v.14 James asks if a faith that does not produce good works can &ldquo;save&rdquo; a person? In this context, the word save doesn&rsquo;t mean yield salvation. We know this because to interpret it otherwise would suggest that good works play a role in our salvation, which the Bible clearly and repeated states is not true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we must consider alternate meanings for the word &ldquo;saved&rdquo; in this context. The Greek word (sozo) has a range of meaning to include salvation but also other earthly forms of saving like being healed or being rescued. In this context, James is alluding to the judgment that believers face for their works. Believers are saved by faith alone from the penalty of their sin, but we are judged according to our works for eternal rewards (see 1Cor 3). So James asks can a life of faith without good works &ldquo;save&rdquo; or preserve the believer from the poor outcome that awaits him at the Judgment Seat of Christ?</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the phrase &ldquo;faith without works is dead&rdquo; refers to a believer living without a desire to accomplish good works for God. Such a person is still saved by their faith, just as Abraham was, but their faith is useless to God in that it produces no glory for Him. In that sense the faith is &ldquo;dead&rsquo; because it is inactive and without purpose.</p>\n\n<p>For a complete explanation of the book of James, please consult our entire James study, which is available here for free <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-studies/the_book_of_james\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

True Christians acknowledge that all mankind was made from one blood (Acts 17:26), and therefore dividing humanity according to physical features (i.e., race) is not a biblical concept. In fact, the concept of race itself is a <a href=\"/bible-answers/is-inter-racial-marriage-biblical\">manmade distinction</a> intended to provide support for human prejudice.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIn truth, the color of human skin, as well as other physical features like the color of human hair, eyes, and other features all, vary along a spectrum that God designed. God never assigns any meaning to these differences, and therefore we should enjoy the diversity of human appearance in the same way we enjoy the variety of flowers or foods or sounds in nature. Only human sin is responsible for turning mankind&#39;s natural physical differences into a justification for prejudice, mistreatment and even slavery. Neither Christianity nor the Bible advocates or even support such sin.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTherefore, those who would suggest that Christianity must be rejected on the basis of race concerns or historical prejudice are disingenuous or deceived. We suspect many are likely unbelievers looking for a cause to insult Christ and reject the Gospel, especially those who also promote pagan religions or the occult as an option to faith in Christ.&nbsp;<br />\nTherefore, you counter such teaching simply by preaching the Gospel, since those who say such things are most likely ignorant of the true Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>As Paul said himself about reaching pagans with the truth:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 1:18&nbsp; For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For it is written,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the cleverness of the clever I will set aside.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:20&nbsp;Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:21&nbsp;For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:22&nbsp;For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:23&nbsp;but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:24&nbsp;but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:25&nbsp;Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 2:1&nbsp; And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 2:2&nbsp;For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 2:3&nbsp;I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 2:4&nbsp;and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 2:5&nbsp;so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.&nbsp;</h5>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Since God said not to murder, isn&#39;t the death penalty immoral?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;The sixth commandment&#39;s prohibition against murder doesn&#39;t preclude&nbsp;taking any life under all circumstances. Murder&nbsp;means the <em>unlawful</em> taking of life. In the commandment against murder in Exodus 20, the Bible intentionally uses the Hebrew word&nbsp;<em>ratzach, </em>which&nbsp;means murder, rather than the Hebrew word for&nbsp;kill,&nbsp;<em>harag. </em>Therefore,&nbsp;the sixth commandment forbids <em>unlawful</em> killing, not all killing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>God granted mankind&nbsp;the right to take life as a penalty for murder or other serious crimes. God granted this right after the flood:</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 9:5 &ldquo;Surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast I will require it. And from every man, from every man&rsquo;s brother I will require the life of man.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Gen. 9:6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Whoever sheds man&rsquo;s blood,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">By man his blood shall be shed,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For in the image of God<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">He made man.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Later, God incorporated the death penalty into His law given to Israel, and numerous crimes carried the death penalty. In the New Testament, Paul reminds the church that God instituted the death penalty for the good of all men to give mankind incentive to do right:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 13:1&nbsp; Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 13:2 Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 13:3 For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 13:4 for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Paul says that every person is expected to live in subjection to government because all governments trace their authority to God Himself. Human government will never be perfect, since all men are sinful. In fact, some governments are very corrupt and cruel, nevertheless we must respect these institutions simply because we trust the Lord&rsquo;s choice to allow them and to work through them over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In general, when we respect government and obey it, we will see greater peace in our lives. Conversely, Paul says in v.2 that when we resist the authority of government, we bring condemnation upon ourselves. So when we do good, the government will (generally) praise us, and when we do evil, then we should expect the government to retaliate against us. This is God&rsquo;s design to incentivize&nbsp;all men to do good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In v.4 Paul says the government is a minister (i.e., servant) of God for the purpose of encouraging good. If a person chooses to do evil, such a person should be afraid, because the government doesn&rsquo;t bear the sword for nothing. The phrase &ldquo;bear the sword&rdquo; was a Roman term meaning the right to condemn a criminal to execution.</p>\n\n<p>In Romans 13&nbsp;Paul is acknowledging that all&nbsp;government has a God-given right to &ldquo;bear the sword&rdquo; (i.e., to employ the death penalty) against those who commit evil. The government&#39;s right to take life for serious crimes is&nbsp;a&nbsp;minister of God, Paul says in v.4, acting as God&rsquo;s personal avenger against those who commit&nbsp;evil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While many governments today choose not to apply the death penalty, nevertheless the right to do so remains. Therefore, it is incorrect for any government or individual&nbsp;to declare that the death penalty is wrong or immoral. On the contrary, the Lord has granted human government the right to take life for the good of all society in controlling evil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You also may might the following answers on our website helpful:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/bible-answers/may-a-christian-carry-a-gun-in-self-defense\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Killing in Self-Defense</span></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/bible-answers/can_a_christian_serve_in_the_military\">Serving in the Military</a></p>"

They were allowed a brief time to live again on earth so their resurrection could serve as a testimony to Jesus&rsquo; claims.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>These people raised at Jesus&rsquo; death were not the&nbsp;&ldquo;captives&rdquo; set free from&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-answers/explain_where_we_go_when_we_die\">Abraham&rsquo;s Bosom</a>, as described by Paul in Ephesians 4.

The souls of these saints were not resurrected into bodies but only taken to Heaven. Even today, all Old testament saints remain without bodies waiting for their resurrection at Jesus&rsquo; Second Coming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So the people who were resurrected at the moment of Jesus&rsquo; death in Matthew 27 were souls brought up from&nbsp;Sheol and returned to their original bodies. God&rsquo;s purpose in raising these bodies was so they could&nbsp;provide a testimony to Jesus as Messiah. Therefore, it was&nbsp;necessary that these people be recently&nbsp;deceased individuals who would be&nbsp;easily&nbsp;recognized by their families, so that when they reappeared in the city, their families would&nbsp;recognize them and authenticate the miracle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Those who were raised in this way had to die (again) at some point and were buried (again). After they died, their souls went to be with Christ in Heaven since it was no longer necessary to spend time in Sheol.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q; If unregenerate man can never seek&nbsp;God according to Romans 3, how could Adam respond&nbsp;to God&#39;s questions in the Garden following&nbsp;the Fall (Genesis 3)</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We suspect you have misunderstood the biblical principle of <a href=\"/bible-answers/what_is_calvinism\">total depravity</a>. The theological principle of total depravity holds that, as a consequence of&nbsp;the Fall of Man, every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of&nbsp;sin&nbsp;as a result of their&nbsp;fallen nature and, apart from the&nbsp;grace of God, is utterly unable to choose to follow&nbsp;God, refrain from&nbsp;evil, or accept the&nbsp;gift of&nbsp;salvation&nbsp;as it is offered.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>On the other&nbsp;hand, the doctrine of total depravity does not deny God&rsquo;s ability to interact with fallen man.&nbsp;God may reveal Himself to fallen man without also regenerating a man&rsquo;s&nbsp;soul, so that the&nbsp;unregenerate man still acknowledges and&nbsp;responds to God without necessarily coming to a saving&nbsp;knowledge and trust in God. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>God is often seen in scripture to interact with fallen man either by theophanies or through His prophets. These encounters do not necessarily require that God regenerating the person as a result of this contact. Examples in scripture include Cain, Hagar and Ishmael, the Pharaoh, Cyrus of Persia, Nebuchadnezzar, the kings of the northern Kingdom of Israel and others.</p>\n\n<p>Though God made Himself known to these unbelieving people, nevertheless there is no indication&nbsp;they repented and came to saving faith. Though God made Himself known to their flesh, He did not apparently make Himself known to their spirit so as to bring them to faith (though argue Hagar and &nbsp; Nebuchadnezzar were regenerated).</p>\n\n<p>When God encountered Adam in the Garden, He spoke to Adam as a fallen, depraved man, and Adam responded as a sinful man &ndash; not in repentance but by blaming God and Woman for his own sin. Nevertheless, God in His grace chose to regenerate Adam as evidenced by Adam&rsquo;s repentance (listen to Lesson 3D of our&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis Bible study</a>&nbsp;to understand how we know Adam was regenerated).</p>\n\n<p>Even after the Fall, God was still interacting with an unbelieving Cain in <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis</a> 4, and even though Cain&nbsp;responded to God, nevertheless God left Cain in his sin. Though Cain spoke with God, he never gained saving faith. As Paul explains in <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans 1</a>, original sin blinded Cain to the truth of God such that Cain could acknowledge God&rsquo;s existence while never trusting in God&rsquo;s promises, as Paul explains in Romans:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 1:22 Professing to be wise, they became fools,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, unregenerate man is capable of experiencing an encounter with God when God chooses to reveal Himself (as in the case of Cain), but such an experience does not necessarily lead to regeneration. Even after such an encounter, the person may remain spiritually dead in their sins. <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_james\">As James says</a>, simply acknowledging God&rsquo;s existence is not equal to regeneration:</p>\n\n<h5>James 2:19 You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, God may reveal Himself to fallen man in a limited sense from time to time yet still leave the person lost in their sin.&nbsp;</p>"

Isn&#39;t this a contradition in scripture?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In John 1, John the Baptist is quoted as saying:</span></p>\n\n<h5>John 1:30 &ldquo;This is He on behalf of whom I said, &lsquo;After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.&rsquo;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John 1:31 &ldquo;I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to Israel, I came baptizing in water.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John 1:32 John testified saying, &ldquo;I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John 1:33 &ldquo;I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, &lsquo;He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John 1:34 &ldquo;I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Notice John the Baptist himself says that he did not recognize Jesus nor did he know Jesus&rsquo; identity as Messiah until after he saw the Spirit descending and remaining on Jesus following Jesus&rsquo; baptism. Based on John&rsquo;s own testimony, we must conclude that he didn&rsquo;t know Jesus&rsquo; identity as Messiah until after he had baptized Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel we read:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 3:13&nbsp; Then Jesus&nbsp; arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John, to be baptized by him.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 3:14 But John tried to prevent Him, saying, &ldquo;I have need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 3:15 But Jesus answering said to him, &ldquo;Permit it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.&rdquo; Then he&nbsp; permitted Him.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 3:16 After being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 3:17 and behold, a voice out of the heavens said, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Matthew&rsquo;s account records that John the Baptist hesitated to baptize Jesus in the beginning because John recognized Jesus&rsquo; superior position. John said Jesus should baptize him instead, implying John knew Jesus was the Messiah. Is this a contradiction with John&rsquo;s account?</p>\n\n<p>No, there is no contradiction.&nbsp;First, notice that Matthew&rsquo;s account never says specifically what John knew of Jesus&rsquo; identity. Matthew&rsquo;s account only indicates that John had great respect for Jesus&rsquo; righteousness. John was&nbsp;baptizing for the forgiveness of sins, so when John says, &ldquo;I have need to be baptized by you,&rdquo; he was simply acknowledging Jesus&rsquo; superior position in terms of righteousness. This acknowledgement doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean John knew Jesus to be the Messiah prior to His baptism.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, John and Jesus were cousins born six months apart and likely grew up together, so Jesus&rsquo; superior righteousness must have been evident to John. Therefore, as John stood in the wilderness calling sinners to receive a water baptism for the repentance of sins, surely he would have been surprised to see his righteous cousin coming to him for such a baptism. John understood that Jesus was far more righteous than he, which explains why John exclaimed that Jesus should baptism him instead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, Jesus insisted on receiving baptism from John, and thereafter the Spirit descended on Jesus leading John to understand why Jesus was so righteous. John came to understand that Jesus was Messiah!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, John&rsquo;s Gospel and Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel agree. John the Baptist didn&rsquo;t know Jesus was Messiah until after the baptism, yet before that time John saw Jesus as the more righteous between them. We can see John&rsquo;s words in Matthew 3 to be a testimony to us that Jesus did, in fact, live a sinless life.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: What do we mean when we say the Bible is without error (i.e., inerrant)?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">No doubt you&rsquo;ve heard critics of&nbsp;the Bible claiming the Bible&nbsp;is full of errors and&nbsp;can&rsquo;t be trusted.&nbsp;Maybe&nbsp;as a new Christian&nbsp;you had doubts about the trustworthiness of the Bible.&nbsp;Such doubts are not only natural, but they&#39;re also good in a way.&nbsp;We should always test what people tell us about&nbsp;the way of&nbsp;salvation.&nbsp;Given all the false religions in the world, knowing that we can trust our Bible is no small matter.</span></p>\n\n<p>To understand the trustworthiness of scripture, we first&nbsp;need to define <em>inerrancy</em>.&nbsp;To say the Bible is&nbsp;inerrant, we mean&nbsp;it is free from error; it is completely truthful. Paul Feinberg has a good working definition:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;Inerrancy is the view that when all the facts become known, they will demonstrate that the Bible in its original autographs and correctly interpreted is entirely true and never false in all it affirms, whether that relates to doctrine or ethics or to the social, physical, or life sciences.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Christians often will add that the Bible is &ldquo;infallible,\"&nbsp;and they may use the term&nbsp;interchangeably with the term inerrant.&nbsp;The Bible is both infallible and inerrant, but it&rsquo;s helpful to understand the differences between the two terms.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">The difference between infallible and inerrant is that one is hypothetical while one is actual.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As R.C. Sproul points out, infallible is a broader term than inerrant in that it speaks to ability or potential. If something is infallible, it is unable to make a mistake or to err.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">If something is inerrant, it does not contain error. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The distinction is that something can be fallible (able to err) but still be inerrant. For example, we know that humans err, but we are also capable of being inerrant. We can write a book that is completely factual and true, or we can make true statements&nbsp;even if we do not do so all the time. If something is infallible, however, it is never&nbsp;able to err.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Thus, humans are not infallible, but they can be inerrant (at times). </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So, if something is infallible it must be, by definition, inerrant. If something is inerrant, it may or may not be infallible. Since all scripture is&nbsp;God-breathed, and since God is infallible, perfect and true, then by necessity the scriptures are both&nbsp;infallible and inerrant. We hold this position</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;because scripture is &ldquo;God-breathed.\" Paul says in 2Timothy 3:16:</span></p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.</span></h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Greek word translated &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; is <em>theopneustos</em>, which means God-breathed, as in&nbsp;coming directly out of God.&nbsp;If one believes that God is perfect and infallible (and He must be or He is not God), then by logical extension&nbsp;all scripture&nbsp;must also be infallible&nbsp;and thus&nbsp;inerrant.</span></p>\n\n<p>At this point, it&rsquo;s important to note that when we say the Bible is infallible and inerrant, this always refers only to the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek writings created by the&nbsp;original authors (e.g., Moses, David, Paul, Peter, etc.). While we&nbsp;don&rsquo;t possess the original works today, we do possess thousands of carefully made copies (called manuscripts).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">These&nbsp;ancient copies may contain minor errors resulting from a copyist&#39;s mistake, but because we possess a comprehensive collection of ancient manuscripts (tens of thousands of ancient manuscripts have been preserved</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">), we can compare them with one another to</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;identify copyist errors. These ancient manuscripts are remarkably consistent with each other,&nbsp;demonstrating the trustworthiness of the copy process. For example, when</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in the 1940s, these first-century copies were&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">com</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">pared to other manuscripts and found&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">to be 99.9% accurate. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Since most people can&#39;t read ancient Hebrew and Greek, the original manuscripts must be translated into modern languages like English.&nbsp;By definition, a&nbsp;translation of scripture is not considered inerrant, since the translation process itself must&nbsp;alter the original words.</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;There are many English translations of the Bible (e.g., NIV, NASB, KJV, NKJV, etc.), and each of these translations renders the text of scripture slightly differently.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Due&nbsp;to the differences in vocabulary and syntax between&nbsp;human language, translations fail to convey the original meaning perfectly. While some&nbsp;translations are deemed more faithful than others,&nbsp;in general, all scholarly translations communicate the meaning of scripture honestly and accurately.&nbsp;It&#39;s important to note that&nbsp;no copyist errors nor translation errors (among the scholarly translations) have ever altered&nbsp;essential doctrines of our faith.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We may ask why God did not preserve the original manuscripts? After all, if He had the power to inspire them in the first place,&nbsp;then certainly He has the power to preserve them. For example, God went so far as to preserve&nbsp;the clothing of the Jews wandering in the desert for forty years&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 8:4), so&nbsp;why did God permit the&nbsp;originals copies of His word to disappear?</span></p>\n\n<p>James Montgomery Boice offers a possible answer:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Knowing human nature, it is reasonable to suppose that if we had supernaturally preserved copies of the biblical manuscripts (or perhaps even the originals themselves), men and women would tend to worship them rather than the God who gave them. &nbsp;We remember the bronze serpent that God gave in Moses&#39; time. &nbsp;Later it was worshiped (2 Kings 18:4).&nbsp; How much likelier is it that people would end up worshiping the manuscripts of the Bible rather than the Lord?</em></p>\n\n<p>With this as a background, let&rsquo;s consider some of the practical aspects of inerrancy.</p>\n\n<h4>Inerrancy Means Historical Accuracy</h4>\n\n<p>All historical accounts in scripture&nbsp;are accurate, including dates and locations. The names of kings, when they ruled, the age of the earth and&nbsp;places that existed in the past, etc. are all recorded accurately in scripture.&nbsp;Recalling the definition of inerrancy above, we often say that&nbsp;&ldquo;when all the facts become known&rdquo; we will see the Bible was correct.&nbsp;This statement&nbsp;is especially&nbsp;true when speaking about our understanding of historical people and events.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Bible describes&nbsp;certain people and places for which we have no independent record, leading some to criticize the Bible as untrustworthy. Nevertheless, later&nbsp;an archeological exploration or&nbsp;historical discovery will yield&nbsp;evidence that these people or places did, in fact, exist just as the Bible reported&nbsp;(<em>e.g.</em>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription\">Behistun Rock inscription</a>). These finds demonstrate that the&nbsp;Bible is historically accurate.</p>\n\n<h4>Inerrancy Exists Even When Old Testament Texts Are Not Recited Verbatim In the New Testament</h4>\n\n<p>New Testament scripture often quotes from Old Testament passages differently than how those passages read&nbsp;in the Old Testament.&nbsp;These differences reflect the differences between the ancient translation of scripture.&nbsp;The Old Testament was originally written in Hebrew and Aramaic,&nbsp;while the New&nbsp;Testament&nbsp;was written in Greek.</p>\n\n<p>When a New Testament author&nbsp;quotes the Old Testament, the writer&nbsp;translates&nbsp;the Hebrew Old Testament text&nbsp;into Greek, which does not have a perfect word-for-word meaning. Then our English Bible must translate&nbsp;the Greek text into English. Therefore, t<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">he New Testament quote has moved from Hebrew to Greek and then to English, while the original Old Testament text moved directly from</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Hebrew to English.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The&nbsp;variances introduced by this&nbsp;extra step of translation&nbsp;can lead to&nbsp;slightly different wording in the New Testament when compared to the original Old Testament quote. Nevertheless,&nbsp;the principle of&nbsp;inerrancy means that even this difference in wording is inspired by the Spirit and thus inerrant. The two&nbsp;renditions&nbsp;of the Old Testament quote will stand together equally to compliment (not contradict) each&nbsp;other in conveying God&#39;s intended meaning.</span></p>\n\n<h4><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Inerrancy Includes the Use of Figures of Speech and Different Literary Genres</span></h4>\n\n<p>Just as we use figurative language in our writing to convey meaning, God does&nbsp;the same in scripture. The Lord uses many literary forms in scripture, including&nbsp;generalities, hyperbole, metaphors, and symbolism. The&nbsp;Bible describes&nbsp;God as possessing&nbsp;\"wings,\" a \"heart,\" and \"arms,\" but scripture also says&nbsp;God is all Spirit and not a man.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, we understand such descriptions to be a type of</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;euphemism called an&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">anthropomorphism</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Figurative&nbsp;language like&nbsp;anthropomorphisms is often better at conveying a thought than literal language, so&nbsp;the scripture&#39;s reliance on figurative language isn&#39;t just cause to reject inerrancy. When we interpret&nbsp;the meaning of scripture&#39;s figures and symbols accurately, the result will always be inerrant.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h4>The Bible Is Inerrant Even When It Does Not Use the Modern Language Of Science</h4>\n\n<p>Clearly, many words and concepts&nbsp;we have today did not exist when scripture was originally written, especially words used in modern science.&nbsp;Therefore, we must allow literary&nbsp;license to the authors of scripture when they use inexact language to describe a process we understand more precisely today.</p>\n\n<p>For example, scripture often speaks of&nbsp;the \"rising\" and \"setting\" of the sun, though we know the sun does not truly rise&nbsp;or set. Scientifically-speaking, the earth turns on its axis&nbsp;producing the appearance of a rising or setting sun. Discrepancies of this type are not examples of error, no more than when we use similar figurative language today.</p>\n\n<p>The Lord understands how His creation works, since He is the Author of science, yet&nbsp;He communicates spiritual truth from&nbsp;a perspectives men can understand, which may require using scientifically inexact&nbsp;language from time to time. Despite the use of such inexact language, the&nbsp;underlying message remains inerrant.</p>\n\n<h4>Inerrancy Does Not Guarantee the Exhaustive Comprehensiveness Of Any Single Account Or Combined Accounts</h4>\n\n<p>Bible critics will point to differences in the details of the gospel accounts as proof the Bible isn&#39;t trustworthy. For example,&nbsp;Matthew says one&nbsp;angel&nbsp;met the women who came to Jesus&rsquo; grave after He had risen, while&nbsp;Luke&nbsp;reports there were two angels. Is one account wrong? No. Each writer highlighted different details in their account, so though&nbsp;Matthew only mentions one angel, this&nbsp;doesn&#39;t mean Matthew was contradicting&nbsp;Luke&#39;s account (or vice versa).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Instead, each gospel account compliments the&nbsp;others by recording the same event from a different perspective. In this case, Matthew chose to mention&nbsp;only one angel, while Luke explained there were two angels present.&nbsp;By combining these two accounts (along with the gospels of&nbsp;Mark and John) we gain a full understanding of the event. In this case, we understand that there were two angels at the tomb, though Matthew chose to mention only one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Once again, such differences are inspired by the Spirit&nbsp;to authenticate the author&#39;s testimony. Ironically, if all four Gospel accounts were identical in every detail, such unnatural consistency would only serve to argue <em>against</em> the trustworthiness of the accounts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Inerrancy Does Not Demand the Infallibility Of Non-Inspired Sources Used By Biblical Writers</h4>\n\n<p>At time, the Bible incorporates non-Biblical material&nbsp;(e.g., Acts 17, Jude).&nbsp;When non-inspired works are quoted in scripture, the quote itself becomes&nbsp;inerrant, however&nbsp;the work from which it originated is not considered inerrant in total. Every human written work may contain truth to some degree, but only scripture is entirely without error. So when authors of scripture quote from nonbiblical&nbsp;sources, they do so under inspiration, therefore&nbsp;the quoted material&nbsp;is without error.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Finally, some may say, \"I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t believe that <em>all</em> the Bible is inerrant, but I&nbsp;believe most of it is inerrant.\" Is such a view consistent with salvation? That is, can a believer hold to the view that the Bible isn&#39;t inerrant?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Certainly, holding to the inerrancy of the Bible&nbsp;is not necessary to being a Christian. Christians are those who believe in the resurrected Christ as their Savior. Nothing more than faith in Jesus Christ is required to be saved, but Christians will be drawn by the Spirit&nbsp;to a greater understanding, appreciation and trust in scripture. Therefore, a confidence in the inerrancy of scripture should be the testimony of every believer.</span></p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, scripture itself testifies that it is God-breathed, which means it is logically impossible for a Christian to hold to a \"partially-inerrant\" position concerning scripture.&nbsp;Scripture is either inspired or not, and if it is inspired, then it testifies to itself that it is all from God. Paul&#39;s letters or Moses&#39; writings were not merely their personal opinions; they were God&#39;s thoughts or else they were nothing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of the history of the church, every generation has&nbsp;struggled against those who would lower the bar on the trustworthiness of scripture.&nbsp;Whenever the Church has departed from a view of scripture as literal and inerrant, the Church has slid into apostasy or worse. Today, we believe the church once again becoming apostate as a result of abandoning a high view of scripture. In&nbsp;place of scripture, men always substitute their thoughts and desires, which lead to destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Denying inerrancy is&nbsp;rejecting that God authored scripture, which in turn questions God&#39;s character, purpose, and sovereign power.&nbsp;How can we trust a God for salvation Who cannot even preserve the integrity of His word, or worse, Who deceives us into thinking scripture&nbsp;is inerrant when it isn&#39;t?&nbsp;In short, if scripture isn&#39;t 100% inerrant, then it must be&nbsp;100% meaningless.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>As a footnote, it&#39;s worth noting that the church throughout history has held to the principle of&nbsp;inerrancy. Challenging&nbsp;the inerrancy of scripture is a relatively new tactic of the enemy, but Peter warned this day would come with mockers challenging what is written. Therefore,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1 Peter 3:15&nbsp;says we must&nbsp;be ready to make a defense to everyone who asks us to give an account for the hope that is in us.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Our defense of the truth can never be simply&nbsp;we had a &ldquo;burning in the bosom\"&nbsp;or some strong other feeling or experience that convinced us Jesus is Lord. Our faith is based on a certain knowledge of God as&nbsp;revealed by Him in His scriptures, and therefore our&nbsp;defense of the truth must be based in a confidence in the scriptures. In short, the&nbsp;Bible declares it is the revealed word of God given to&nbsp;mankind so we may know&nbsp;of the salvation that is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">How can we give this&nbsp;defense if we hold that scripture is trustworthy only in part or not at all?&nbsp;Thanks be to God&nbsp;He has provided for us His word which is&nbsp;as infallible and inerrant as its&nbsp;Author.</span></p>"

Are the practices of Freemasonry compatible with Christianity?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry\" target=\"_blank\">Freemasonry</a> is a quasi-religious, fraternal organization dating back to medieval times. The organization began as an association of stonemason&nbsp;trade craftsmen, but today local lodges operate&nbsp;more like civic or social clubs. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Members are admitted to membership through initiation rites and often must make certain pledges to the lodge. Freemasons are encouraged to pursue multi-level &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; by mastering an understanding of freemasonry&rsquo;s mystical symbolism which borrows heavily from Jewish and Christian Gnosticism.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>In general, this organization presents a serious threat to the spiritual life&nbsp;of a believer. Freemasons promote personal belief in \"diety\" but they accept that all diety are equally valid and must be respected. Freemasons hold that non-Christian may enter Heaven, and therefore a&nbsp;freemason must not attempt to convert members to one&#39;s religion. Since members agree to be bound by these&nbsp;rules, a Christian who joins the Freemasons must pledge to respect the belief that Jesus Christ to just another \"god\" and must agree to disobey&nbsp;Christ&#39;s command for all believers to share the Gospel with the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the organization&#39;s members are invited to participate in rituals and recitations that closely mirror traditional pagan&nbsp;and&nbsp;occultic practices, which clearly violates scripture&rsquo;s command to avoid such things. Freemasons are called to profess the \"<a href=\"/bible-answers/what-are-sacred-name-movements\">secret&nbsp;name</a>\" of God, as explained by Masonic writer Albert Pike in his writing,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Book_of_the_Words.html?id=KlLPjK9ETyoC&amp;redir_esc=y\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Book of the Words</em></a>,&nbsp;and local lodges may&nbsp;conduct ancient rites of worship&nbsp;to invoke the worship of this name.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Even the more sedated&nbsp;local lodges still compromise a Christian&#39;s walk by pressuring members to&nbsp;pledge various oaths in violation of&nbsp;scripture (<em>see Matt 5:24</em>), to accomplish goods works as part of a works-salvation theology (Pike&#39;s book, a common handbook used in lodge, states that salvation must include works), and various other compromises.</p>\n\n<p>Many believers who participate in Freemasonry are ignorant to the organization&#39;s dangers, since&nbsp;each lodge operates independently and may follow only a few of these practices. Nevertheless, the organization is not harmless, and in time the believer will likely be exposed to dangerous heresy and pagan practices.</p>\n\n<p>We strongly urge any believer caught up in Freemasonry to leave the organization. The Church body is the best place to find fellowship and from which to ministry to a&nbsp;local community.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: Is the Orthodox Church (i.e., Greek Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox) a true Christian church? Are their beliefs consistent with the Bible?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A: The Orthodox Church is an offshoot of the Roman Catholic Church. Though the Orthodox Church does not recognize the authority of the Roman pope and rejects various Catholic practices (notably celibacy for priests), nevertheless the&nbsp;church&nbsp;holds many of&nbsp;the same doctrine and beliefs as Catholicism, including&nbsp;a false gospel preaching&nbsp;mysticism and human works as the means to salvation&nbsp;in keeping with&nbsp;the <a href=\"/bible-answers/are-roman-catholics-truly-christian\">teaching&nbsp;of the Catholic Church</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Specifically, the Orthodox church believes that salvation is by faith in Christ, but they teach that faith in&nbsp;Christ alone is not sufficient to receive eternal life.&nbsp;Like Catholicism, the Orthodox church holds that&nbsp;other requirements (i.e., good works) are required for salvation. Essentially, the Orthodox church teaching on salvation is the same as&nbsp;Catholic teaching in this area.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Secondly, t</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">he Orthodox church&nbsp;venerates Mary&nbsp;as do Catholics, calling her the&nbsp;\"Most Holy Mother of God.\" Mary&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">is praised in their hymns as \"more honorable&nbsp;than the Cherubim and beyond compare more&nbsp;glorious than the Seraphim,\" suggesting that Mary (a human being) is higher than angels, which directly contradicts scripture (see Psalm 8:4-5).&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Going even further, the church says Mary is the \"Mother of the Church &mdash; it is in Her person that the Church glorifies&nbsp;motherhood.&rdquo; Notice they even capitalize any&nbsp;pronoun&nbsp;referring to Mary as if Mary were equal with&nbsp;deity.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">To glorify Mary in this way is nothing short of blasphemy, as&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">God does not share His glory with anyone (see Isaiah 42:8).</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Again, this is very Catholic.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Orthodox church&nbsp;equates church tradition&nbsp;with scripture, including erroneously holding that water&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">baptism washes away our sins, at least initially. To quote official church teaching:</span></p>\n\n<h6><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;The&nbsp;sacrament of Baptism occurs only once in a person&rsquo;s life. In Baptism&nbsp;the human person is granted freedom from original&nbsp;sin and forgiveness of&nbsp;all his personal transgressions. However, Baptism is only the first&nbsp;step in the human person&rsquo;s ascent&nbsp;towards God. If it is not accompanied&nbsp;by a renewal of one&rsquo;s entire life and a spiritual regeneration, it might&nbsp;be fruitless. The&nbsp;grace of God, received in Baptism as a pledge or as a&nbsp;seed, will grow within the person and be made manifest throughout his&nbsp;&nbsp;whole life so long as he strives towards Christ, lives in the Church and&nbsp;fulfills God&rsquo;s commandments.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></em></h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Finally, the Orthodox church venerates (i.e., assigns spiritual power to) the dead, calling them&nbsp;\"saints\"&nbsp;and praying to them for spiritual blessing. As with Catholics, this practice is blaspheme and contrary to scripture</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">There are other&nbsp;similarities with Catholic&nbsp;doctrinal, but these serious&nbsp;departures from scripture are certainly sufficient for us to&nbsp;conclude that the Orthodox church is a false church teaching a false Gospel that cannot save.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong>Important Footnote</strong>:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We must allow for the possibility that from time-to-time&nbsp;true Christians may be found attending the Orthodox Church. Like the Catholic Church&nbsp;the Orthodox Church does <em>not</em> preach the true Gospel nor does it practice biblical Christianity, but that does not&nbsp;mean&nbsp;God&#39;s Spirit is incapable of bringing true faith to someone within this community. Nevertheless, should a member of the Orthodox Church come to saving faith in Jesus Christ, we can only say that the&nbsp;person was born again <em>despite</em> the church&#39;s negative influence, not because of the church.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, we encourage all&nbsp;born-again Christians to seek fellowship in churches that hold to the true Gospel. Remaining closely tied to a false church can have serious negative influences on the believer&#39;s walk of faith. &nbsp;</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Does the Bible specify how a Christian must be buried? I&#39;ve heard it taught that believers should be buried with our feet facing East and our head&nbsp;facing West&nbsp;since West is the direction of holiness, but I can&#39;t find this in the Bible.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As you mentioned, East and West&nbsp;can have associated meanings in eastern philosophy and in scripture. In the Bible, East is often associated with Satan, sin, judgment and the fallen world, while West is associated with the opposite concepts of God, holiness, salvation, and Heaven.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Perhaps for this reason,&nbsp;the practice of burying the dead with feet facing east has become a long-standing tradition crossing many religions and cultures, though it is not universally practiced. For example, many pagan cultures worshiped the sun in some form, therefore facing the direction of the rising sun (i.e., East) was the preferred burial position for ancient pagans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Jews typically buried their dead facing west, because the tabernacle design required approaching the glory of God in the Holy of Holies by entering the tabernacle from east to west. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Christians adopted a practice of burying their dead facing east because the scripture teaches that at the Messiah&#39;s Second Coming into Jerusalem, He will approach from the East (<em>see Isa 63:1; Zech 14:4; Matt 24:27</em>). Therefore, Christians who believed they would be resurrected at the Second Coming of Christ gave instructions to have their bodies buried facing East so they might&nbsp;greet Jesus face-to-face at His Second Coming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>All of these practices are based in superstition and faulty theology,&nbsp;not on the Bible. Regarding Christian practice, there is no prescribed method for burial in the Bible&nbsp;nor even was the tradition consistent with scripture.&nbsp;The Bible teaches that believers will be resurrected at the Coming of the Lord for the Church (commonly called the Rapture), not at Christ&#39;s&nbsp;Second Coming to Earth. (<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For a complete explanation of the rapture, please listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation Bible study</a>.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Secondly, at our death our spirit goes to be with Christ, so our conscious self is not &ldquo;in the grave&rdquo; awaiting Christ&rsquo;s return. Instead, we live with Him in the Heavenly realm while we wait for the resurrection:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 5:6&nbsp; Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord &mdash;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Cor. 5:7 for we walk by faith, not by sight &mdash;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Cor. 5:8 we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Paul contrasts being &ldquo;at home in the body&rdquo; with being &ldquo;at home with the Lord.&rdquo; Being at home in the body means being alive on the earth, while being at home with Christ means our body having&nbsp;died and our spirit having gone to be at Christ&rsquo;s side in Heaven. According to Paul, when a believer dies his spirit goes into the presence of the Lord, while his earthly body remains behind buried.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Therefore, there we will not experience our future resurrection from the perspective of an earthly body lying&nbsp;in the grave. On the contrary, we will experience it from Heaven, as our spirit accompanies Christ back to the clouds, as Paul described above in 1Th 4:15-17. We will witness our own resurrection from the perspective of our spirit in the clouds.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Thirdly, those who do remain alive on earth awaiting the resurrection do not meet Christ on earth in a cardinal direction. Rather,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">scripture teaches that at the resurrection believers remaining on earth are \"caught up\" to meet Jesus in&nbsp;the clouds:</span></p>\n\n<h5>1Th. 4:15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep [died].&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Th. 4:16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Th. 4:17 Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, the direction of movement to Jesus is upward, not East or West.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the new body isn&rsquo;t constructed using the material of our original earthly bodies. Paul says that our new bodies will be constructed from entirely new materials:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 15:42&nbsp; So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised an imperishable body;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:43 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:44 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:45 So also it is written, &ldquo;The first man, Adam, became a living soul.&rdquo; The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:46 However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:47 The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:48 As is the earthy, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:49 Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Paul says that our second body will be of a &ldquo;heavenly&rdquo; material rather than an earthly material. This change is necessary because the earth is under a curse (see <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis 3</a>). Therefore, the positioning&nbsp;of our earthly body in the grave (or even if <a href=\"/bible-answers/cremation-or-burial\">we are cremated</a>) will have no bearing whatsoever on our eventual resurrection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In summary, burial traditions are based in superstition, not a proper view of scripture. For the Christian, we have liberty to dispose of our earthly body as we desire. The direction of burial is irrelevant. At death our current body returns to dust, while our spirit lives on in the company of Jesus. One day we will receive a new eternal body, but our new body won&#39;t originate from the burial location or material of our old body. The Lord creates a new heavenly body for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You may also be interested in our article on <a href=\"/bible-answers/cremation-or-burial\">Burial vs. Cremation</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

Will it be possible that I see them in the after life or can they be saved after they die?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;The Bible is clear that only by faith in Jesus Christ may someone enter into Heaven:</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 4:11 &ldquo;He is the stone which was rejected by you, the builders, but which became the chief corner stone.<br />\nActs 4:12 &ldquo;And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:11 For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 2:6 who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>John 6:53&nbsp; So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.<br />\nJohn 6:54 &ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.<br />\nJohn 6:55 &ldquo;For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.<br />\nJohn 6:56 &ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.</h5>\n\n<h5>John 8:24 &ldquo;Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>John 14:6&nbsp; Jesus&nbsp; said to him, &ldquo;I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, if someone dies without confessing faith in Jesus Christ, nothing can save them from eternal judgment. This is the testimony of the Bible, and we must not compromise on this truth. If this truth is unacceptable to a person or even leads them to reject the salvation offered by Christ, then there is no other option for them. They too will perish:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 2:3 how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? After it was at the first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>While we may wish we could see our unbelieving relatives, we will never know them again. Instead, we will receive a new eternal family which are all believers united by faith into one family:</p>\n\n<h5>Mark 10:29 Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel&rsquo;s sake,<br />\nMark 10:30 but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.</h5>"

I wonder because nowhere else in the New Testament do we find believers called \"salt.\"</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The reference you quoted comes from a discourse from Jesus called the&nbsp;Beatitudes found in Matthew 5:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 5:11&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:12 &ldquo;Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:13&nbsp; &ldquo;You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:14&nbsp; &ldquo;You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:15 nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:16 &ldquo;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</span></h5>\n\n<p>When Jesus says&nbsp;a person is to&nbsp;be \"salt\" of the earth,&nbsp;He&nbsp;means a person is to&nbsp;stand&nbsp;out&nbsp;from the world by giving distinction to God&rsquo;s truth and thereby bringing life to the world. He uses the metaphor of salt, because&nbsp;salt gives distinction to the taste of food and is a necessary element for sustaining the life of the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The passage above is taken&nbsp;from a much longer discourse running&nbsp;from Matthew 5:1&ndash;7:27. By the rules of interpretation, we must consider this entire discourse to be spoken to the same audience without interruption unless the text itself indicates that Jesus&rsquo; words were taken from different conversations or moment. In this case, we see no such interruption, and therefore the same audience heard all the words Jesus spoke during this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As we read the entire discourse, we see clearly that Jesus&#39; audience were His disciples gathered around Him,&nbsp;not unbelievers. Therefore,&nbsp;we must conclude that these words were intended to describe the believer, not an&nbsp;unbeliever. Furthermore, the meaning of Jesus&#39; statement only makes sense when applied to a believer. A believer is to stand out from the rest of the unbelieving world, to remain distinct like salt. This is not possible for an unbeliever, since by definition an unbeliever <em><strong>is</strong></em> the world.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, just as&nbsp;the nation of&nbsp;Israel was called to be a light in their day, likewise the Church is now called to be&nbsp;salt (and light) by bringing God&rsquo;s truth to a world that does not know Him.&nbsp;</span></p>"

Joel describes similar events:</p>\n\n<h5>Joel 2:28 &nbsp;&ldquo;It will come about after this<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;T<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">hat I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And your sons and daughters will prophesy,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Your old men will dream dreams,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Your young men will see visions.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Joel 2:29&nbsp; &ldquo;Even on the male and female servants<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I will pour out My Spirit in those days.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Joel 2:30</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;&ldquo;I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Blood, fire and columns of smoke.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Joel 2:31&nbsp;&ldquo;The sun will be turned into darkness<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And the moon into blood<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Joel 2:32 &ldquo;And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the Lord<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Will be delivered;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">There will be those who escape,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As the Lord has said,<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Even among the survivors whom the Lord calls.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>The book of Joel describes events during Tribulation, and like in Revelation, Joel describes moments of God&#39;s wrath when&nbsp;the sun is darkened and other signs appear in the sky. Nevertheless,&nbsp;these signs are not the same as those described in Revelation 6 because the context of the two passages does not match.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In Revelation 6, the events of the seal judgments occur at the very beginning of the seven-year Tribulation, while the events described in Joel are associated with the very end of Tribulation. In Joel 2:32 we read that the signs in the sky will immediately precede the rescue of Israel, but the rescue of Israel occurs at the very end of the Tribulation, according to Zechariah 12-14. Therefore, the signs in the sky in Revelation 6 are different than the ones that are described in Joel 2.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In fact, these types of signs do appear numerous times during Tribulation.&nbsp;Across the Old Testament prophets and in the book of Revelation, we can find at least&nbsp;four separate occasions when blackouts or other signs in the sky occur during Tribulation. The book of&nbsp;Joel describes two such occasions, one in chapter 2 and another in chapter 3.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the blackout described in Joel 2 is the blackout associated with the fifth bowl judgment near the end of Tribulation. Soon thereafter, the nation of Israel will be saved as described in Zechariah 12. The blackout of the sixth seal judgment is an earlier moment in Tribulation.</p>"

At the end of chapter 20, we&rsquo;re told that our present creation will be completely destroyed and will be found no more.</p>\n\n<p>In its place, the Lord will make a new heavens and earth. This&nbsp;new creation described in Revelation 21 completely replaces the original earth and universe. Notice in v.1 we&rsquo;re told that the original earth and heavens (i.e., the universe) have passed away. In its place, a new creation called the &ldquo;new Jerusalem&rdquo; descends out of God&rsquo;s dwelling place in Heaven. This is an entirely new creation to replace our existing one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the Father will be in that place, as John says later in chapter 21:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 21:22&nbsp; I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rev. 21:23 And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Early in v.3 John writes that God will tabernacle with men in this new age. God, in this case. means&nbsp;all three Persons of the Godhead, as Paul explains in 1Corinthians 15:</span></p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 15:23&nbsp;But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:24&nbsp;then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:25&nbsp;For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:26&nbsp;The last enemy that will be abolished is death.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:27&nbsp;For He has put all things in subjection under His feet. But when He says, &ldquo;All things are put in subjection,&rdquo; it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:28&nbsp;When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Paul explains that when the end of the Kingdom comes, Jesus will hand all rule and authority over to the Father so that the Godhead will become &ldquo;all in all,&rdquo; Paul says. This implies that the Three Persons of the Godhead will work as One in this age, though the meaning of Paul&rsquo;s words is unclear.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the arrival of the Father does not mean we will \"see\" Him, as the Bible says He cannot be seen by His Creation:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 6:15 which He will bring about at the proper time &mdash; He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Tim. 6:16 who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion! Amen.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<h5>1John 4:12 No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>For a complete explanation of these things, please consult our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation study</a>.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: The parable of the Talents in Matthew 25 and the parable of the Minas in Luke 19 seem so similar, and yet many details don&#39;t line up. Are they teaching about the same thing or different things? Can you explain the parables?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Both the parable of the Talents and the parable of the Minas teach that believers (i.e., the slaves) are called to serve Christ (i.e., the master)&nbsp;in His absence, and upon His return, Jesus will reward us.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As you observed, the parables are not identical, because they&nbsp;are teaching two different aspects of the Kingdom reward system. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">First, in&nbsp;Matthew 25 we read:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 25:14&nbsp; &ldquo;For it is just like a man about to go on a journey, who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:15&nbsp;&ldquo;To one he gave five talents, to another, two, and to another, one, each according to his own ability; and he went on his journey.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:16&nbsp;&ldquo;Immediately the one who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and gained five more talents.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:17&nbsp;&ldquo;In the same manner the one who had received the two talents gained two more.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:18&nbsp;&ldquo;But he who received the one talent went away, and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master&rsquo;s money.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:19&nbsp; &ldquo;Now after a long time the master of those slaves&nbsp; came and&nbsp; settled accounts with them.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:20&nbsp;&ldquo;The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, &lsquo;Master, you entrusted five talents to me. See, I have gained five more talents.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:21&nbsp;&ldquo;His master said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:22&nbsp; &ldquo;Also the one who had received the two talents came up and said, &lsquo;Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have gained two more talents.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:23&nbsp;&ldquo;His master said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:24&nbsp; &ldquo;And the one also who had received the one talent came up and said, &lsquo;Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:25&nbsp;&lsquo;And I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:26&nbsp; &ldquo;But his master answered and said to him, &lsquo;You wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:27&nbsp;&lsquo;Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:28&nbsp;&lsquo;Therefore take away the talent from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:29&nbsp;&ldquo;For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 25:30&nbsp;&ldquo;Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></h5>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">In the parable, a master gives his slaves&nbsp;&ldquo;talents\" to steward during His absence. A talent in Jesus&rsquo; day was a measure of weight of about 130 lb or nearly 60 kg.&nbsp;A&nbsp;talent of silver was equal to 9 years salary for a laborer, so even&nbsp;a single talent represented considerable personal resources. In fact, our modern meaning of the word&nbsp;&ldquo;talent&rdquo; finds its origins in this parable. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">The three slaves received differing amounts of wealth based on their ability. Evidently, the master recognized the&nbsp;abilities and limitations of each servant, so he assigned responsibility to each accordingly.&nbsp;Regardless of the degree of responsibility, each slave was expected to devote his full time and attention to managing the talent(s) he was given. Even the slave who received only one talent still had a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;responsibility in light of the high value of a talent. Therefore, all slaves must serve faithfully in the master&#39;s absence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">At the end of the parable, the master returns and evaluates each slave&rsquo;s service seeking to know if the slave had been faithful in discharging his duty.&nbsp;The first slave&nbsp;doubled his five talents as did the slave given two talents, so both slaves received the same commendation from the master.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Even though the master assigned a different degree of responsibility to each slave, he did so&nbsp;understanding each slave&rsquo;s ability, therefore&nbsp;when both slaves performed faithfully, the master awarded each slave equally.&nbsp;The master&rsquo;s commendation&nbsp;to each slave in v.21 and v.23 was identical and emphasized each slave&#39;s faithful service&nbsp;rather than the magnitude of his achievement.&nbsp;Only the third slave received a rebuke for failing to provide&nbsp;faithful service to his master.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Based on these details, we see Jesus is describing a reward system for believers.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Christ (i.e., our master) invites every believer (i.e., His slaves) to serve Him during His absence.&nbsp;A talent in the parable symbolizes a believer&rsquo;s duty to serve the Lord faithfully in some important and challenging way, and the way we are called to serve the&nbsp;Lord will vary in keeping with our&nbsp;abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Jesus calls some believers to assume greater burdens than others. Some believers&nbsp;must bear greater burdens in serving Christ&rsquo;s (i.e., five&nbsp;talents), while other believers&nbsp;are asked to make fewer sacrifices in serving the Lord (i.e., two talents).&nbsp;Nevertheless, all&nbsp;believers are expected to demonstrate faithfulness so as to receive an equal inheritance.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">A faithful servant&#39;s&nbsp;reward is a share of Christ&#39;s&nbsp;inheritance in the Kingdom.&nbsp;</span>The&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Bible teaches explicitly that believers will receive a portion of Christ&#39;s inheritance on the Earth to enjoy during the 1,000-year Kingdom:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Col. 3:23&nbsp;Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 3:24&nbsp;knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.</span></h5>\n\n<h5>Col. 1:12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Eph. 1:11 also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Eph. 1:14 who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God&rsquo;s own possession, to the praise of His glory.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">The</span>&nbsp;parable is focused on&nbsp;Christ&#39;s&nbsp;inheritance&nbsp;as seen in v.14 by the way the parable opens speaking about&nbsp;the master&rsquo;s &ldquo;possessions.\" In fact, n<span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">otice how each faithful slave was permitted to keep the additional talents he earned during the master&#39;s absence. In a sense, we can say the slaves stored&nbsp;up wealth for themselves by their faithful service to the master.&nbsp;</span>Scripture commands the believer to do this very thing:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 6:19&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 6:20 &ldquo;But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 6:21 for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span></h5>\n\n<p>We store up treasure by faithfulness to our assigned duties in service to Christ, not the magnitude of our accomplishments. Christ may assign us lesser opportunities to serve Him, but our assignment does <em>not</em> limit&nbsp;our potential inheritance. For example, a<span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;pastor serving faithfully in a small church and a Christian mother serving&nbsp;faithfully in her home may be rewarded&nbsp;equally with the Apostle Paul or Martin Luther, assuming equal faithfulness.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In a related parable, Jesus addresses the criteria for assigning material reward in the Kingdom:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 20:1&nbsp; &ldquo;For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:2&nbsp;&ldquo;When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:3&nbsp;&ldquo;And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:4&nbsp;and to those he said, &lsquo;You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.&rsquo; And so they went.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:5&nbsp;&ldquo;Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:6&nbsp;&ldquo;And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing around; and he&nbsp; said to them, &lsquo;Why have you been standing here idle all day long?&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:7&nbsp;&ldquo;They&nbsp; said to him, &lsquo;Because no one hired us.&rsquo; He&nbsp; said to them, &lsquo;You go into the vineyard too.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:8&nbsp; &ldquo;When evening came, the owner of the vineyard&nbsp; said to his foreman, &lsquo;Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last group to the first.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:9&nbsp;&ldquo;When those hired about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:10&nbsp;&ldquo;When those hired first came, they thought that they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:11&nbsp;&ldquo;When they received it, they grumbled at the landowner,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:12&nbsp;saying, &lsquo;These last men have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:13&nbsp;&ldquo;But he answered and said to one of them, &lsquo;Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius?</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:14&nbsp;&lsquo;Take what is yours and go, but I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:15&nbsp;&lsquo;Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 20:16&nbsp;&ldquo;So the last shall be first, and the first last.&rdquo;</span></h5>\n\n<p>This parable in Matthew 20 confirms that faithful service earns a material reward in the Kingdom, and all believers who serve the Lord faithfully will receive an equal inheritance regardless of when we were &ldquo;hired.&rdquo;&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Even those assigned the least role to&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">serve Christ (i.e., the one&nbsp;receiving only a single talent) are still</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;expected&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">to rise to the challenge and demonstrate faithfulness, and if they do they will receive an equal reward.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Finally, the third servant who&nbsp;produced no return received no reward at all. In the parable, Jesus says the slave was&nbsp;&ldquo;afraid&rdquo; of the master and&nbsp;&ldquo;went away&rdquo; after the master departed, which indicates the slave did not love the master nor did he wish to remain in the house serving him. When the master returns, he calls this slave&nbsp;&ldquo;wicked&rdquo; and&nbsp;&ldquo;lazy.&rdquo;&nbsp;The slave is sent to \"outer darkness.\" In other words, the slave&#39;s faithlessness&nbsp;demonstrated&nbsp;he was truly no servant at all, which&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">resulted in the master putting him out of the home.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches that without faith it is impossible to please God, and&nbsp;so this final slave was included in the parable to reinforce the necessity&nbsp;of faith before reward.&nbsp;The slave&rsquo;s unwillingness to serve his master was proof that he was faithless.&nbsp;He was never truly a disciple, so he was sent to outer darkness, which pictures the disposition of unbelievers (i.e., hell).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In summary, Matthew&rsquo;s parable teaches that faithfulness in service to Christ will determine our inheritance in the Kingdom. Believers may be assigned different opportunities to serve Christ, but faithful service will be rewarded equally. As Jesus said elsewhere:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 16:10&nbsp;&ldquo;He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 16:11&nbsp;&ldquo;Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth, who will entrust the true riches to you?</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 16:12&nbsp;&ldquo;And if you have not been faithful in the use of that which is another&rsquo;s, who will give you that which is your own?</span></h5>\n\n<p>Moving to&nbsp;Luke 19, Jesus teaches a similar parable yet with significant differences:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 19:11&nbsp; While they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:12&nbsp;So He said, &ldquo;A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:13&nbsp;&ldquo;And he called ten of his slaves, and gave them ten minas and said to them, &lsquo;Do business with this until I come back.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:14&nbsp;&ldquo;But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, &lsquo;We do not want this man to reign over us.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:15&nbsp;&ldquo;When he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him so that he might know what business they had done.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:16&nbsp;&ldquo;The first appeared, saying, &lsquo;Master, your mina has made ten minas more.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:17&nbsp;&ldquo;And he said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to be in authority over ten cities.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:18&nbsp;&ldquo;The second came, saying, &lsquo;Your mina, master, has made five minas.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:19&nbsp;&ldquo;And he said to him also, &lsquo;And you are to be over five cities.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:20&nbsp;&ldquo;Another came, saying, &lsquo;Master, here is your mina, which I kept put away in a handkerchief;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:21&nbsp;for I was afraid of you, because you are an exacting man; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:22&nbsp;&ldquo;He&nbsp; said to him, &lsquo;By your own words I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am an exacting man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:23&nbsp;&lsquo;Then why did you not put my money in the bank, and having come, I would have collected it with interest?&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:24&nbsp;&ldquo;Then he said to the bystanders, &lsquo;Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:25&nbsp;&ldquo;And they said to him, &lsquo;Master, he has ten minas already.&rsquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:26&nbsp;&ldquo;I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 19:27&nbsp;&ldquo;But these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence.&rdquo;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Here we find a story that&#39;s familiar in the broad outline,&nbsp;yet numerous&nbsp;details differ from the parable in Matthew. Let&#39;s focus on the differences in Luke&#39;s parable.</p>\n\n<p>First, a master departs again with the intent to return. He leaves to receive a new kingdom. As the master goes, he leaves ten slaves behind commanding them to \"do business\" until he returns. The Greek word for \"do business\" (<em>pragmateuomai</em>) means to keep occupied, to busy oneself. So the slaves are&nbsp;expected simply to&nbsp;pursue&nbsp;everyday life, not some&nbsp;special project or task.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly,&nbsp;the unit of weight in this parable has changed from a talent to&nbsp;a mina. In Jesus&rsquo; day&nbsp;one mina was equal to 1/60th&nbsp;of a talent, so a mina represented considerably less value than a talent. Once again, the relatively modest payment to each slave&nbsp;is consistent with&nbsp;the master&#39;s charge to \"do business.\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, every slave received the same number of minas. No slave was given an advantage in this assignment since all had the equal task of doing business.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth,&nbsp;when the master returned he assigned rewards&nbsp;proportional to each slave&#39;s performance. Those&nbsp;who accomplished more with their minas received a proportionally greater reward.</p>\n\n<p>Finally and most significantly, the form of the reward was not more&nbsp;wealth but authority over cities. Since the master had received a new kingdom, he needed&nbsp;men to assist him in ruling this new territory, so he assigned responsibility in the new kingdom according to each slave&#39;s performance in everyday matters. The slaves who went about everyday business more effectively were deemed worthy of greater responsibility in managing the new kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These differences in Luke&#39;s parable lead us to conclude&nbsp;that Jesus was&nbsp;teaching on a second kind of Kingdom reward system. While Matthew&rsquo;s parable taught how believers receive <em>material wealth</em> in the Kingdom, Luke&rsquo;s&nbsp;parable teaches how the Lord will assign believers <em>responsibility to rule</em> in the Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Scripture teaches that in addition to receiving an eternal inheritance in the Kingdom, believers may also receive a place of ruling in Christ&rsquo;s Kingdom government:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 20:4&nbsp; Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 6:2 Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? If the world is judged by you, are you not competent to constitute the smallest law courts?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Luke 22:28&nbsp; &ldquo;You are those who have stood by Me in My trials;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 22:29 and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, I grant you</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 22:30 that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></h5>\n\n<p>According to Luke 19, the Lord will use different criteria for assigning responsibility than for assigning wealth. What are the criteria for receiving responsibility in the Kingdom? Our first clue is the prominent repetition of the number ten&nbsp;in this parable.&nbsp;For example, the master initially calls&nbsp;ten slaves (though only three are judged), and each slave received ten minas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The number ten in scripture signifies testimony or witness,&nbsp;indicating this&nbsp;parable is focused on a believer&#39;s testimony not his degree of service. Further reinforcing this conclusion, the slaves were told to do business, which means pursue everyday activities. A believer&#39;s good testimony is not a special work or short-term task. Rather, we are called to live our entire life as a daily testimony to our faith, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 12:1 &nbsp;Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Our witness for Christ is accomplished through our good works as&nbsp;Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 5:14&nbsp; &ldquo;You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:15&nbsp;nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:16&nbsp;&ldquo;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</span></h5>\n\n<p>The \"good works\" Jesus mentions&nbsp;in Matthew 5:16 are the works of sanctification,&nbsp;of shining our light before men, and when&nbsp;Paul says a believer must present his body&nbsp;as a living sacrifice to the Lord, he is speaking of crucifying&nbsp;the passions of our flesh and walking in the Spirit (Gal 5:24).&nbsp;Those who pursue sanctification in this way are&nbsp;producing good works and a good testimony. Those who live in their flesh are grieving&nbsp;the Holy Spirit and failing to produce a good testimony.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Just as every slave began with an equal number of minas, so every believer has an equal opportunity to yield a good testimony. The Lord does not&nbsp;&ldquo;handicap&rdquo; one&nbsp;believer over another in the call to be sanctified. Though our life&#39;s&nbsp;circumstances, spiritual gifts and mission may vary. Nevertheless&nbsp;every&nbsp;believer receives the same Spirit, has access to the same word of God and therefore must answer&nbsp;the&nbsp;same call to godliness. As Jesus said:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 5:48 &ldquo;Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">The test is whether we will obey this command as we do business on earth?&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The believer who yields a good testimony in this life is demonstrating to Christ he is worthy to be entrusted with greater responsibility in the Kingdom. Therefore, a</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;believer&#39;s testimony of godliness will determine</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;his or her ruling position in the Kingdom.</span></p>\n\n<p>This judgment is proportional: a&nbsp;believer with a better testimony will be awarded a greater opportunity to serve in the Kingdom, while a believer with a poorer testimony will receive&nbsp;a lesser degree of authority in the Kingdom.&nbsp;Those&nbsp;believers who obey the Spirit in seeking sanctification&nbsp;by the washing of the water with&nbsp;the word (see Eph 5:26-27) will receive&nbsp;a reward of authority proportional to their&nbsp;obedience. Conversely, those who squander&nbsp;their&nbsp;opportunities to seek a good testimony will receive less&nbsp;opportunity to serve Christ in the Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>The Lord awards authority&nbsp;proportional to the quality of a believer&#39;s testimony,&nbsp;because spiritual maturity is an essential factor in&nbsp;competent spiritual&nbsp;leadership, therefore&nbsp;who&nbsp;better to&nbsp;receive greater authority&nbsp;in the Kingdom than the one who has achieved greater spiritual maturity during&nbsp;the present world? As Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 12:48&nbsp;...From everyone who has been given much, much will be&nbsp;required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask all the more.</h5>\n\n<p>In the case of the slave who produced no results with his minas, the master&rsquo;s judgment is&nbsp;a denial of reward just as it was in Matthew, but unlike in Matthew 25, this slave is not consigned&nbsp;to outer darkness. This distinction reflects how every believer has eternal security regardless of the degree of our sanctification. Faith is required for salvation but a good testimony is not.&nbsp;A&nbsp;believer with a poor testimony who fails to pursue sanctification will still saved by their faith and cannot be denied the Kingdom, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 2:11 It is a trustworthy statement:<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Tim. 2:12&nbsp;&nbsp;If we endure, we will also reign with Him;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; If we deny Him, He also will deny us;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Tim. 2:13&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>The Lord cannot&nbsp;deny Himself (i.e.,&nbsp;His promises to the believer), so the Lord remains faithful. Nevertheless, a believer who denies Christ a&nbsp;testimony of sanctification&nbsp;will be denied&nbsp;an opportunity to reign with Christ in the kingdom, as Paul says in 2Tim 2:12.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that Luke&rsquo;s parable still includes the example of an unbeliever though the&nbsp;unbeliever in Luke&#39;s parable is called an \"enemy,\" not a slave. This distinction makes sense, since Luke&#39;s parable isn&rsquo;t focused on faithfulness but rather a&nbsp;testimony, and discussions of testimonies are only&nbsp;relevant for&nbsp;believers.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize the differences between the&nbsp;two parables,&nbsp;f<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">aithful&nbsp;service leads to equal Inheritance (the talents), while better testimony leads to greater&nbsp;authority (the minas).&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Our inheritance in the Kingdom will be&nbsp;determined by&nbsp;<em><strong>what we do for Christ</strong></em>, while our authority in the Kingdom will be determined by <em><strong>who we become in Christ</strong></em>.&nbsp;</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: I had an encounter in a restaurant with a strange&nbsp;man who was clearly demon-possessed. He followed me and taunted me, but I didn&#39;t know how a Christian should respond in that situation. What does the Bible say?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Scripture tells us that the struggles we have in serving Christ and reaching the world with the Gospel always have a spiritual origin:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 6:11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Eph. 6:12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.</span></h5>\n\n<p>The enemy and his demons may inhabit the body of any unbeliever as the Lord permits, and by that indwelling may manipulate and control them causing them to do many violent and extreme things (usually attributed to mental illness by the unbelieving world). Even among those unbelievers who aren&rsquo;t possessed directly, the enemy still maintains a degree of control through the fear of death. These are the one Jesus came to free by faith:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 2:14&nbsp; Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 2:15 and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>By your testimony, we assume you have encountered demon-possessed individuals, and this is not uncommon. We believe there are many demon-possessed people around us in the world, though unbelievers and even many believers are unwilling to acknowledge this reality. We commend you for having the spiritual wisdom to recognize the situation accurately and to seek counsel on how best to respond. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, a believer has no reason to fear the enemy, since the Holy Spirit in us has far greater power than does the enemy:</p>\n\n<h5>1John 4:4 You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Our eternal fate is secure in Christ, so the enemy can do nothing greater than taking our earthly life, and scripture says that since our body will die one way or another, this is nothing important. Rather, we only live in fear of the Lord:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 10:28 &ldquo;Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</h5>\n\n<p>Furthermore, a believer cannot be indwelled by a demon, since the Holy Spirit&#39;s presence within the believer will not permit the enemy access. As Jesus taught by way of a parable:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 12:43&nbsp; &ldquo;Now when the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and does not find it.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 12:44 &ldquo;Then it says, &lsquo;I will return to my house from which I came&rsquo;; and when it comes, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 12:45 &ldquo;Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. That is the way it will also be with this evil generation.&rdquo;</span></h5>\n\n<p>In the parable, the evil spirits returned to the &ldquo;empty&rdquo;&nbsp;house (i.e., unbeliever&#39;s body) because nothing prevented them from returning, but if the house has been claimed during their absence (i.e.,&nbsp;by the Holy Spirit as a result of faith in the Messiah), then the evil spirits would not have been able to reside again. Jesus was teaching this parable to make a point about&nbsp;the unbelief He encountered in Israel. Nevertheless,&nbsp;His message is equally&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;for us today. Once we are \"occupied\" by the Holy Spirit, the Lord hangs a \"No Vacancy\" sign outside our body denying demons entry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Despite possessing the Holy Spirit, believers possess&nbsp;no special power <em>over</em> the enemy. Scripture tells us to understand that the enemy and his demons have real power and not to think ourselves greater than they:</p>\n\n<h5>Jude 9 But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, &ldquo;The Lord rebuke you!&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>2Pet. 2:10 and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority. &nbsp;Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble when they revile angelic majesties,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Pet. 2:11 whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches that we do not possess power over the devil, since God made angels more powerful than human beings. In fact, Peter teaches that the devil outranks even the most powerful&nbsp;angel, so certainly we should not expect to have power over him!&nbsp;Obviously,&nbsp;the Lord may permit us to prevail over the enemy in a given situation, but even then it is the Lord&#39;s power that overcomes the enemy, not our own. Conversely, when the enemy gains some measure of success against us (<em>see the book of Job</em>), we know the Lord has permitted this outcome&nbsp;for the purpose of strengthening us spiritually in the hope we might receive a blessing:</p>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 5:8 Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Pet. 5:9 But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Pet. 5:10 After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you. &nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, the scripture never directs a believer to confront the enemy or his demons. Any such action is presumptuous on our part, since it assumes the Lord will <em>always</em> act on our behalf to give us victory against the enemy&#39;s schemes (which is not necessarily true...see Job again!). Unless the Lord has specifically directed us to confront the enemy&#39;s agents in some way, we should not venture to challenge the demonic realm.&nbsp;On the contrary, we respect their power, resist their attempts to tempt us into sin, and rest&nbsp;in the Lord&#39;s protection by His Spirit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In fact, scripture promises that if we resist the enemy&#39;s efforts to lead us astray, he&nbsp;will eventually flee:</p>\n\n<h5>James 4:7 Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In light of the earlier scripture, we know that resisting the enemy doesn&rsquo;t mean actively fighting him but rather it means not giving into his temptations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In summary, we should not fear the enemy but neither should we imagine we have power against him. When we see someone possessed by the demonic realm, we should understand that the person is not our enemy, since our enemy is not flesh and blood. Nevertheless, we should not attempt to fight the power of the demon inside the person by our power. Should the Spirit direct us in some way against the person, then we should obey and operate in the Spirit. Otherwise, we should act wisely by resisting any temptation of the enemy to respond in anger, hatred or pride.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on this topic, we recommend you take our <a href=\"/bible-studies/letter_of_jude\">Jude study</a>.</p>"

Next, Noah&#39;s sons were already alive when the Lord appeared to Noah and gave him instructions to begin building the ark (Gen 6:18). Finally, the flood came in the 600th year of Noah&rsquo;s life (Gen 7:11).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Noah must have spent a maximum of 100 years (and probably slightly less) building the Ark.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Why did Jesus ask the Father&nbsp;why He was forsaken on the cross? What did Jesus mean?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">On the cross, Jesus made seven declarations, including:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 27:46 About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Jesus was quoting Psalm 22, which is a prophetic psalm describing the Messiah&#39;s experience dying on the cross. Consider the following excerpts from the psalm:</p>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:1 &nbsp;My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?<br />\nFar from my deliverance are the words of my groaning.</h5>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:6 &nbsp;But I am a worm and not a man,&nbsp;<br />\nA reproach of men and despised by the people.</h5>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:7. All who see me sneer at me;<br />\nThey separate with the lip, they wag the head, saying,</h5>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:8 &nbsp;&ldquo;Commit yourself to the Lord; let Him deliver him;<br />\nLet Him rescue him, because He delights in him.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:11 &nbsp; Be not far from me, for trouble is near;<br />\nFor there is none to help.</h5>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:12 &nbsp; Many bulls have surrounded me;<br />\nStrong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.</h5>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:13 &nbsp;They open wide their mouth at me,<br />\nAs a ravening and a roaring lion.</h5>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:14. I am poured out like water,<br />\nAnd all my bones are out of joint; My heart is like wax;<br />\nIt is melted within me.</h5>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:16. For dogs have surrounded me;<br />\n&nbsp;A band of evildoers has encompassed me;<br />\nThey pierced my hands and my feet.</h5>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:17 &nbsp;I can count all my bones. &nbsp;<br />\nThey look, they stare at me;</h5>\n\n<h5>Psa. 22:18 &nbsp;They divide my garments among them,<br />\nnd for my clothing they cast lots.</h5>\n\n<p>Clearly, the psalm is describing the experience of Jesus on the cross. The psalm begins with the statement Jesus spoke on the cross, asking the Father why He was forsaken.&nbsp;Jesus wasn&#39;t asking the question because He didn&#39;t understand what was happening. Rather, He asked the question to draw our attention back to this psalm so that we could know of its fulfillment in Him.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Jesus was drawing our attention to the significance of what was happening on the cross in that moment.&nbsp;The word &ldquo;forsaken&rdquo; in Greek means to abandon or to desert, and for three hours on the cross, Jesus was \"forsaken\" by the Father. At that moment on the cross, the Son of God was abandoned by the Father, spiritually speaking. From all eternity the Father and Son have been One, but in this moment the Son experienced a separation from the Father. Separation from the love of God is the death that sin requires, according to scripture (i.e., the Second Death).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Though Jesus had no sin of His own, He took upon Himself the sin of those He died to save, as Paul explain:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 5:21 He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>As the Father placed the sins of the world on Christ, Jesus experienced separation from the Father for the first time in eternity. This was a moment of great suffering for our Lord, made necessary by our sin. It was accompanied by three hours of darkness on earth:</p>\n\n<h5>Mark 15:33 &nbsp;When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.<br />\nMark 15:34 At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?&rdquo; which is translated, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>For three hours Jesus suffered spiritual&nbsp;death though He had not yet experienced physical death. Later, Jesus experienced physical death so that He could descend to <a href=\"/bible-answers/why_didnt_jesus_have_to_stay_in_hell_longer\">set free the captives</a>. This is the same order in which Adam experienced death: first, spiritual death at the moment he ate the fruit followed by physical death years later as a result of the curse on the earth. In this way we see that Jesus was the New Adam.</p>\n\n<p>After Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection, the Father honored Christ&rsquo;s obedience by resurrecting Him and restoring Him to the Father&rsquo;s right hand as Christ requested before His death:</p>\n\n<h5>John 17:4 &ldquo;I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished the work which You have given Me to do.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John 17:5 &ldquo;Now, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.</span></h5>\n\n<p>As Jesus predicted:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 22:67 &ldquo;If You are the Christ, tell us.&rdquo; But He said to them, &ldquo;If I tell you, you will not believe;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 22:68 and if I ask a question, you will not answer.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 22:69 &ldquo;But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.&rdquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 22:70 And they all said, &ldquo;Are You the Son of God, then?&rdquo; And He said to them, &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</span></h5>\n\n<p>And as the writer of Hebrews confirms:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 1:3 And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,&nbsp;</h5>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: In 2Kings 2 the Lord removed Elijah without experiencing death. Did Elijah enter Heaven in bodily form (like Enoch)? If so, how was this possible before Jesus&#39; death and resurrection? Also, Elijah writes a letter to King Jehoram in 2Chronicles 21, but this king lived years after God took Elijah. How did he write this letter?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Bible&#39;s accounts of Enoch&#39;s translation and Elijah&rsquo;s removal from the earth tell us nothing about what happened to them after they were removed from the Earth. We can only know they did not see death on earth. In the case of Enoch, we read this:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 11:5 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Hebrews 11 says only that Enoch didn&rsquo;t experience death. Nothing more is said about his destination after death. For Elijah, we read</p>\n\n<h5>2Kings 2:11 As they were going along and talking, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire which separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind to heaven.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Again, we only know that Elijah was removed from the earth. The writer says Elijah was taken &ldquo;to Heaven&rdquo; but the Hebrew word for heaven is <em>shamayim</em>, which can take one of three distinct meanings:&nbsp;the sky, outer space or God&rsquo;s throne room.&nbsp;We know the writer described Elijah&rsquo;s departure from his perspective on the ground, so&nbsp;the writer could only say that Elijah was taken into the <em>shamayim</em> (i.e., the sky).&nbsp;Nothing more can be assumed about Elijah&rsquo;s final destination.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in both cases, we cannot say from these passages that these men entered into the presence of God in bodily form.&nbsp;On the other hand, scripture says definitively that no man entered into Heaven before Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>John 3:13 &ldquo;No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended from heaven: the Son of Man.</h5>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Paul says Christ is the first fruits of the resurrection (1Cor 15:23), which means He was the first to enter Heavenly in bodily form. The Bible says clearly &ldquo;no man&rdquo; preceded Christ, which rules out any exceptions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it is theologically impossible for a man to precede Christ into Heaven. Christ said that no man could reach the Father except through Him:</p>\n\n<h5>John 14:6 Jesus&nbsp; said to him, &ldquo;I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.</h5>\n\n<p>Had it been possible for the Father to permit sinful men (like Enoch or Elijah) to enter His presence in bodily form before Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, then the Father would have had no need for Christ to die on the cross! If the Father possessed another way to resurrect sinful men before Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, then He&nbsp;would&nbsp;have had no reason to sacrifice His Son to make resurrection possible. Clearly, Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection were the only way to reconcile men to the Father, which precludes any possibility that Enoch or Elijah could be resurrected before Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we must conclude that while the Lord permitted these men to avoid death, nevertheless He could not bring them into His presence in bodily form. Based on other scripture, we must assume their souls were transferred to Abraham&rsquo;s Bosom (see Luke 16) to await the arrival of Messiah just like all Old Testament saints. God granted these men remarkable departures from the earth, but He couldn&#39;t grant them entry into Heaven before Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice. Scripture specifically states this was not possible, and therefore it did not happen (John 3:13).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the timing of Elijah&rsquo;s departure from the earth, the Bible never specifies the date of Elijah&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp;Bible scholars have assumed Elijah was removed during the reign of Ahaziah or perhaps that of his successor, Jehoshaphat because the writer of 2Kings recorded his account of Elijah&rsquo;s departure in chapter 2, between the account of the Ahaziah&rsquo;s death in 2Kings 1 and the reign of Jehoshaphat in 2Kings 3. In chapter 3,&nbsp;Jehoshaphat calls for a prophet, but he is told that only Elisha was present, the prophet that&nbsp;succeeded Elijah.</p>\n\n<p>Since Elijah is absent in1Kings 3, scholars conclude that the&nbsp;events of 2Kings 1-3 are presented&nbsp;chronologically. If this is true, it raises a problem in 2Chronicles 21. In 2Chron 21 we read this:</p>\n\n<h5>2Chr. 21:4&nbsp; Now when Jehoram had taken over the kingdom of his father and made himself secure, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and some of the rulers of Israel also.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>2Chr. 21:12&nbsp; Then a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet saying, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord God of your father David, &lsquo;Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father and the ways of Asa king of Judah,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Chr. 21:13 but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot as the house of Ahab played the harlot, and you have also killed your brothers, your own family, who were better than you,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Chr. 21:14 behold, the Lord is going to strike your people, your sons, your wives and all your possessions with a great calamity;&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Notice that Elijah sent a letter to Jehoram, who is the son of Jehoshaphat of Judah. If Elijah sent a letter to Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s successor, Jehoram, then it appears&nbsp;Elijah was alive even after&nbsp;Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s reign, which contradicts the conclusion that Elijah was removed before Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s rule.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve said, the timing of Elijah&rsquo;s departure is an assumption, since&nbsp;scripture&nbsp;never specifies the exact date of Elijah&rsquo;s removal. Based on 2Chron 21, we know this&nbsp;assumption must be wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We must use the explicit teaching of scripture to guide any implied understanding.&nbsp;While 2Kings 2-3 may imply Elijah was removed before Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s reign, 2Chron 21 explicitly tells us that Elijah was still alive even after Jehoshaphat had died and his successor, Jehoram, as ruling. The explicit teaching in 2Chron 21 must guide our understanding (and&nbsp;assumptions) of 2Kings 2.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we conclude that Elijah was still alive during Jehoram&rsquo;s reign. In 2Kings 3, Jehoshaphat called for a prophet, but only Elisha was present and ministering at this time. Apparently, Elijah was living elsewhere. The text in 2Kings 3 doesn&rsquo;t say Elijah was dead but only that he wasn&rsquo;t present. Elijah had previously given his mantle as a prophet of Judah to Elisha, so Elisha was operating as a prophet for many years while Elijah still lived.&nbsp;Elijah&#39;s absence in Judah explained his need to compose a letter&nbsp;to communicate with King Jehoram rather appearing before him.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So why did the writer choose to record Elijah&rsquo;s departure so early in 2Kings? We can only&nbsp;guess, but writers of scripture commonly move events&nbsp;around&nbsp;in time for stylistic or theological purposes. In this case, the writer chose to record Elijah&rsquo;s departure earlier than it happened perhaps to emphasize Elisha&rsquo;s role as the primary prophet during Elijah&#39;s declining years.</p>"

Is it true Moses had multiple wives?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A: In Numbers 12 we read this:</p>\n\n<h5>Num. 12:1 &nbsp;Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman);&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Num. 12:2 &nbsp;and they said, &ldquo;Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?&rdquo; And the Lord heard it.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>We read that Moses had taken a Cushite woman as a wife. Cush is the ancient name for the region called Ethiopia today. Moses&#39;s wife, Zipporah, was from Midian in Arabia. Midian and Cush are different places in the Bible, so this Cushite woman must be a different wife than the one Moses took while in Midian.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, nothing in the Bible suggests that Moses was married to these two women&nbsp;<em>simultaneously</em>. On the contrary, the evidence suggests Moses married the Cushite woman after Zipporah&#39;s death. The events of Numbers 12 occur when Moses is already over 80 years old, so it&#39;s very likely that Zipporah had died by that time. Since his first wife had died, Moses was able to marry again. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Further circumstantial evidence for Zipporah&#39;s death is found in the conflict between Miriam, Aaron and Moses. Moses&#39; decision to (re)marry became Aaron&#39;s and Miriam&#39;s&nbsp;excuse to discredit Moses in an attempt to usurp his authority over Israel. The Bible consistently condemns taking multiple wives, and even&nbsp;Jesus Himself declared that when one&nbsp;man and one woman come together in marriage to become one flesh, and any additional marriage relationship&nbsp;is&nbsp;sin.</p>\n\n<p>Yet in Numbers 12&nbsp;we read God coming to Moses&#39; defense, which strongly suggests that Moses had done nothing wrong in God&#39;s eyes by marrying the Cushite. These details support the conclusion that Moses married after Zipporah&#39;s death, though her death is not recorded in scripture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we must conclude that in Numbers 12&nbsp;Moses was remarrying after having become a widower, not taking multiple wives.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: I heard a pastor&nbsp;praying over members of his congregation using a strange babbling speech. He claimed he was praying in&nbsp;a mysterious prayer language which made him an intermediary to God for his congregation and gave him a \"direct line\" to God. He pointed to Romans 8:26 to justify his practice. It sounded like nonsense to me. Is this biblical?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;The practice you witnessed in the church was unbiblical and not of God. The pastor and the congregation were deceived by the enemy and were likewise leading others astray. The pastor&#39;s claim to be serving as God&#39;s intermediary or intercessor is particularly disturbing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Believers must guard against prioritizing&nbsp;personal experiences over objective biblical truth. When our experiences contradict scripture&rsquo;s teaching (e.g., when we witness people babbling and <strong><a href=\"/bible-answers/is_speaking_in_tongues_biblical\">claiming it is the gift of tongues</a></strong>), we must deny the experience, since it is not of God. Those who wish to maintain unbiblical practices&nbsp;will either distort scripture to force it into agreement with their practices or else they will ignore scripture altogether. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this case, the pastor appears to be twisting scripture to justify his unbiblical teaching. Paul never taught that praying in tongues is babbling or that it serves as a &ldquo;hotline&rdquo; to God. All prayer is offered as&nbsp;real human language and is equally capable of reaching the Lord, as He promises to hear the prayers of His children at all times:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 6:6&nbsp;&ldquo;But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.<br />\nMatt. 6:7&nbsp; &ldquo;And when you are praying, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words.<br />\nMatt. 6:8&nbsp;&ldquo;So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.</h5>\n\n<p>God hears all prayers from believers equally, therefore no &ldquo;special&rdquo; form a prayer exists. By inserting himself between the church and Christ, this pastor was repeating the Nicolaitan heresy Jesus mentions in <strong><a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation</a></strong> (<em>see&nbsp;Rev 2:6</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Those who maintain that their repetitive babbling or moaning sounds are actually a special &ldquo;prayer language&rdquo; will usually cite <strong><a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans 8:26</a></strong> to support their belief, though when they do, they grossly misinterpret the scripture. When we read Romans 8:26 in context, we find Paul was teaching on something entirely different in that passage:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:18&nbsp; For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:19&nbsp;For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:20&nbsp;For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope<br />\nRom. 8:21&nbsp;that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:22&nbsp;For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:23&nbsp;And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:24&nbsp;For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for who hopes for what he already sees?&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:25&nbsp;But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:26&nbsp; In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:27&nbsp;and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s necessary to read Romans 8:26 in its complete context to properly interpret its meaning. In Romans 8 Paul is wrapping up his eight chapters explaining the way of salvation by faith in Christ. At this point in the text, Paul explains God has assigned us a new spirit by faith in Christ yet He expects us to live on earth for time in our sinful body. During this time, we will know suffering and struggle against sin even as we await our glorified body.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this passage Paul explains that we are not alone in our struggle against sin and in our desire for freedom. The whole creation itself is &ldquo;groaning&rdquo; for freedom from sin, because the entire Creation is under the same curse.</p>\n\n<p>In v.20 Paul says the creation was unwillingly subjected to this &ldquo;futility,&rdquo; which is a reference to God&#39;s curse on the ground in <strong><a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis</a></strong> 3:17&nbsp;as a result of Man&rsquo;s sin. Adam&rsquo;s choice brought the entire Creation under condemnation, yet God&#39;s curse included a hopeful purpose. Paul says we were subjected to a curse of physical death so that ultimately we may receive something better. Specifically, Paul says we await the \"redemption of the body\" in v.23&nbsp;referring to our resurrection into a new, eternal body to replace our current dying body.</p>\n\n<p>In v. 23 Paul says we have already received a down payment on that new body in the form of \"the&nbsp;first fruits of the Spirit,\" referring to the indwelling of God&rsquo;s Spirit in our current body at the moment of our faith. The Spirit works to bear spiritual&nbsp;fruit in each of us, which is a taste of the perfection to come in the new body. The Spirit&#39;s work in us is&nbsp;our evidence that the Lord will keep His promise to give us a new body.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In v.24 Paul says \"in hope\" we have been saved, meaning by our faith in Christ we have reason to hope in our new body. Hope in this sense doesn&#39;t mean an unfilled desire. Rather, it means a certain expectation yet one that has not come to pass.&nbsp;A Christian&#39;s hopeful expectation&nbsp;is to&nbsp;one day be set free from sin&#39;s penalty of corruption and&nbsp;death, so we&nbsp;eagerly await the day we receive our glorified bodies.</p>\n\n<p>A&nbsp;hope means a confidence in an unseen future outcome, therefore&nbsp;we cannot say we \"hope\"&nbsp;for something that has already arrived (v.24).&nbsp;Instead, we must live with perseverance by faith contending with the trials and difficulties that come from living in a sinful body. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Turning to v.26&nbsp;Paul begins with the&nbsp;phrase &ldquo;in the same way&rdquo; to draw a comparison between the two roles of the Holy Spirit. First, the Holy Spirit gives us reason to hope in the future arrival of the new body, because He is proof to us that the Lord intends to keep His promises. Secondly&nbsp;(i.e., in the same way), the&nbsp;Spirit helps us in our present weaknesses.&nbsp;While we await the new body, we must contend with the sin of ou flesh, and the Spirit helps us in that fight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Spirit&#39;s ministry in us includes making appeals on our behalf with \"groanings too deep for words.\"&nbsp;Paul uses the word &ldquo;groanings&rdquo; here again as a reference back to his earlier use of the same word in v.22. In v.22 Paul used the word to emphasize the weighty burden that the Creation bears under the curse. The curse God delivered on the earth placed all Creation in a state of decay, corruption and death, and therefore the world is&nbsp;&ldquo;groaning&rdquo; under the weight of this death sentence, like slaves groaning under the burden of their captivity.</p>\n\n<p>In v.26 Paul uses the same word again to emphasize the burden we experience contending with the weaknesses of our sinful body.&nbsp;Our spiritual weaknesses are so profound that we often&nbsp;lack the ability even to&nbsp;know how to communicate our needs before God. Like slaves who can&#39;t understand how to find their own freedom, believers often&nbsp;don&rsquo;t know how to seek for freedom from our own sin.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;the Spirit knows our spiritual deficits and the opportunities&nbsp;for relief our Father is prepared to grant us. Therefore, we can take additional&nbsp;hope knowing the Spirit in us will intercede on our behalf even when we don&rsquo;t know what or how to pray, and Paul calls these Spirit intercessions \"groanings too deep for words.\"&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">The Greek word translated \"deep\" in v.26 is&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">alaletos</em><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">, which literally translated means \"inexpressible.\"&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In other words, Paul is teaching that&nbsp;Spirit communicates directly to the Father on our behalf in ways&nbsp;outside human speech.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>If the Spirit&#39;s groanings are outside human speech, then Paul cannot be&nbsp;advocating for any type of utterance prayer, whether babbling or \"groaning\" or any other sound made by the human mouth. The Spirit&#39;s intercession is beyond the abilities of the human mouth, Paul says in v.26. It is a purely spiritual form of communication between two members of the Godhead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Rather than endorsing the practice of \"babbling prayer,\" Romans 8:26 actually&nbsp;<em>precludes</em> such nonsense, so&nbsp;when someone babbles or groans in \"prayer\" claiming the behavior&nbsp;is in accordance with Paul&#39;s teaching in&nbsp;Romans 8:26, the person is&nbsp;merely operating in the flesh (not by the Spirit),&nbsp;and in the process they are demonstrating their ignorance of scripture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: My church&#39;s small groups are studying through the book \"The Story,\" which is a summary of the Bible. I am concerned that this is a violation of Jesus&#39; command in Revelation 22:19 not to change the text of scripture. Is it acceptable to study summaries of the Bible?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Every Christian is called by scripture to know and follow the&nbsp;full counsel of the word of God.&nbsp;Unfortunately, many Christians today are largely biblically illiterate, and therefore they find the prospect of studying the Bible itself to be a daunting and overwhelming task.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Consequently, in the course of their personal studies, a Christian may choose to consult outside reference works of one kind or another to assist in an&nbsp;understanding of scripture. \"<strong><a href=\"http://www.thestory.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Story</a></strong>\" is one such reference work as are the resources we offer on our website. In fact, solving the problem of the biblically-illiterate Christian is the very reason VBVMI exists. We hope to aid students in the study of God&rsquo;s word by walking them through the text of scripture in a methodical manner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consulting teaching resources like these can be helpful to a Bible student, but these materials can never replace a proper, in-depth study of the word of God itself. Condensed&nbsp;summaries of scripture like \"The Story\" do not contain the full counsel of God&rsquo;s word, therefore such summaries cannot suffice for meaningful Bible study.&nbsp;Every Christian must understand and respect the difference between studying the Bible and studying books about the Bible. Reading books about the Bible can only compliment study of the Bible; they cannot replace study of the Bible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To make a simple comparison, a person could learn how to perform an emergency medical procedure by watching a YouTube video, but a person can&rsquo;t become a qualified doctor merely by watching YouTube videos. Similarly, a Christian can gain a simple understanding of key biblical characters and events by reading a summary like &ldquo;The Story,&rdquo; but a summary of the Bible can never impart the same spiritual wisdom and growth that comes only by studying the actual word of God. Simply put, there are no shortcuts to holiness and spiritual maturity.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we advise all Christians to seek to understand the full counsel of God&rsquo;s word in an unedited form in addition to relying on supplemental study materials like commentaries or summaries. If your church body or small group relies exclusively on summaries (i.e., books about the Bible), then we believe this is a harmful trend that will handicap the spiritual growth of that community in the long run. Such a trend should be reversed by following the&nbsp;command of the writer of Hebrews:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 5:12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 5:13 For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 5:14 But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 6:1&nbsp; Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 6:2 of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Moving ahead into spiritual maturity should be the goal of every Christian, and this goal demands a life-long study of the whole counsel of God&rsquo;s word, verse-by-verse (i.e., the &ldquo;solid food&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s word). Relying exclusively on commentaries or summaries is equivalent to living on milk exclusively, which is a recipe for spiritual disaster, according to Hebrews.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, regarding your concern about Jesus&rsquo; warning at the end of Revelation, our Lord was warning against someone changing God&rsquo;s word and then claiming that their adulterated text is equal to scripture. The &ldquo;bible&rdquo; used by <strong><a href=\"/bible-answers/are_mormons_considered_christians\">Mormons</a></strong> or&nbsp;the popular book&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong><a href=\"/bible-answers/is-the-message-a-good-bible-translation\">The Message</a></strong>&rdquo; by Eugene Peterson are&nbsp;examples of such adulterated works.&nbsp;As far as we know, \"The Story\" does not attempt to represent itself as scripture, and therefore it is not in&nbsp;violation of Jesus&#39; command. &nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Paul says in 1Corinthians 14 that a woman may not ask questions in the church gathering. Is this a rule for women today as well? Can a woman ask a question of a male teacher in a mixed group gathering?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;Generally, in mixed groups the Bible expects men to lead teaching and to ask and answer the questions, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 2:11&nbsp;A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 2:12&nbsp;But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 2:13&nbsp;For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 2:14&nbsp;And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 2:15&nbsp;But women will be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>This principle may include some minor variations in practice, which our ministry considered in another&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"/bible-answers/can_a_woman_ever_teach_a_man\">article</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your specific concern, Paul&nbsp;gave a very specific command to the church in Corinth concerning women asking questions of men during a public teaching:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 14:34&nbsp; The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 14:35&nbsp;If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice in v.34 that Paul juxtaposes women speaking up in the service with women subjecting themselves to male headship (authority). Paul is implying that when the women in Corinth were asking questions, they were doing it for improper motives. The women were trying to undermine the authority of the male teachers by questioning their teaching.&nbsp;Their questions were not (apparently) asked in a sincere desire to understand the truth. Instead, the questioning was part of an effort to show themselves smarter than the men who taught them. It was a sinful motive.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, earlier in the letter Paul described how women in the church in Corinth were taking dramatic steps (including shaving their heads) to claim equality with men, which violated God&rsquo;s prescription for the church. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Paul&rsquo;s point in chapter 14 concerning women speaking in the assembly was limited to those women who spoke up expressly for the purpose of challenging and undermining male teachers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, we hold that it is permissible for a woman to ask questions of a male teacher in a mixed group so long as she does so with a genuine interest in obtaining clarification or to understand scripture better. She may ask her question publicly so long as her intentions are pure. If her questioning transitions into a confrontation, challenge&nbsp;or&nbsp;dispute, then the woman should silence herself and expect her husband to answer her questions or else carry the questioning forward on her behalf (assuming he shares her concerns).</p>\n\n<p>By following this practice, a woman will guard against creating a&nbsp;perception that she is not submitted to the authority of men in the church or to her husband&#39;s spiritual authority as her teacher. Obviously, many wives are better students of scripture than their husbands, which is why scripture expects wives to look to their husbands for instruction and leadership. Husbands need to be spiritual leaders in their homes, including in their ability to know and teach scripture.</p>\n\n<p>If a husband is falling behind in this way, his wife should seek ways to encourage her husband&#39;s growth and maturity, rather than seeking to usurp his role.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: Why does a loving God permit suffering to exist in His Creation?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A;&nbsp;The question of suffering is a common one, but the Bible has the answer. In short, the answer for why suffering exists is sin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sin is disobedience to God and a departure from living in the counsel of God&rsquo;s word. When Adam decided to disobey God&rsquo;s word in the Garden, he brought sin into the nature of mankind:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 5:12&nbsp; Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned &mdash;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Adam&#39;s decision to sin set in motion of chain of events that plunged the world into every suffering imaginable, as Paul explained:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 1:21&nbsp;For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:22&nbsp;Professing to be wise, they became fools,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:23&nbsp;and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:24&nbsp; Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:25&nbsp;For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:26&nbsp; For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:27&nbsp;and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:28&nbsp; And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:29&nbsp;being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:30&nbsp;slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:31&nbsp;without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 1:32&nbsp;and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>As Paul explains, the sin of mankind eroded men&rsquo;s ability to know God and follow His word. In a short time, men had ceased to acknowledge and worship the Creator God, and in His place men adopted false gods. False worship produced impure hearts in mankind, which succumbed to degrading passions. From generation to generation, depravity consumed mankind leading to hatred, disobedience and all the sin we experience today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Every act of cruelty, selfishness, depravity and violence finds its source in the sin of one man, which was passed down to every human being through procreation. The world is filled with sin because the very nature of every human being is inherently sinful. We act in keeping with our fallen nature, yet&nbsp;God has patiently tolerated the suffering created by humanity&rsquo;s sin because He loves the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This statement may seem paradoxical, but it&rsquo;s true. God loves the world too much to act against its sin &ndash; at least not yet. Were God to judge sin and put an end to its existence, then He must by necessity put an end to all humanity since sin lives in each person. So God enacted a plan to end sin without wiping out all humanity, as He declared subtly to Adam and Woman immediately after the Fall:</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 3:15&nbsp; &nbsp;And I will put enmity&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Between you and the woman,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And between your seed and her seed;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He shall bruise you on the head,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And you shall bruise him on the heel.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>To address Adam&rsquo;s sin, the Lord promised to bring a &ldquo;seed&rdquo; from woman to defeat the serpent&rsquo;s seed. God was saying He would bring a Messiah, a Christ, to conquer Satan and reverse the effect of&nbsp;Adam&rsquo;s sin. Notice however that the Lord promised to bring this solution to a future day. The Lord&rsquo;s plan works through procreation (i.e., \"seed\") so that&nbsp;over time the Lord will preserve some within the human race from the destruction required by His inevitable judgment against sin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The solution&nbsp;is centered in Christ, as Paul teaches:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 7:24&nbsp;Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death?&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:25&nbsp;Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>As the Bible teaches repeatedly, the solution to our sin is found only in faith in Jesus Christ. First, our faith in Jesus Christ saves us from the eternal penalty of sin, which is judgment in the eternal fire. Secondly, our faith brings Christ to live inside us through His Spirit. The Holy Spirit indwells every believer convicting them of sin and providing them the power to live according to God&rsquo;s word. Finally, in a day to come we will be resurrected into a new eternal body that will be sin-free and will never die again (like Christ), which will remove sin from our experience altogether, as Paul explains:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 15:53&nbsp;For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 15:54&nbsp;But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, &ldquo;Death is swallowed up in victory.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 15:55&nbsp;&ldquo;O death, where is your victory? O death, Where is your sting?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 15:56&nbsp;The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 15:57&nbsp;but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Lord has the plan to end all suffering in Creation by ending all sin, but before the Lord bring His plan to a conclusion, He must wait for the birth of every person He intends to save through faith. Obviously, He must wait patiently for&nbsp;generations of humanity to come to pass, so that all those intended for salvation would be permitted to live and&nbsp;come to faith in Christ. The Lord is long-suffering, patiently enduring the sin of so many in order to reach a few. As Peter explains:</p>\n\n<h5>2Pet. 3:8&nbsp; But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.&nbsp;<br />\n2Pet. 3:9&nbsp;The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Once the last soul God intends to rescue has been born and has come to repentance, then He will bring an end to all sin and the suffering it causes by removing all sinners from the earth. As Jesus described:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 25:31&nbsp; &ldquo;But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.<br />\nMatt. 25:32&nbsp;&ldquo;All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;<br />\nMatt. 25:33&nbsp;and He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left.<br />\nMatt. 25:34&nbsp; &ldquo;Then the King will say to those on His right, &lsquo;Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.<br />\n<br />\nMatt. 25:41&nbsp; &ldquo;Then He will also say to those on His left, &lsquo;Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;<br />\n<br />\nMatt. 25:46&nbsp;&ldquo;These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Jesus uses a metaphor of sheep and goats to describe the believers and unbelievers who will be separated at His coming to reign. At that moment, the Lord will bring the sinners to an end in anticipation of the Kingdom. In the Kingdom Jesus begins to put suffering to an end, culminating with this conquering of Satan and death at the end of His reign, as Paul explains:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 15:21&nbsp;For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 15:22&nbsp;For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 15:23&nbsp;But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 15:24&nbsp;then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 15:25&nbsp;For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 15:26&nbsp;The last enemy that will be abolished is death.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So in summary, the suffering of life on Earth today is a result of sin reigning in the hearts of every human being. Nevertheless, the Lord has set a plan in motion to rescue His Creation from sin and suffering, but that plan waits for God&#39;s elect to be born over the course of thousands of years of history. Meanwhile, the Lord is saving men and women in every generation by faith in Jesus Christ, and these who receive Christ will overcome suffering in their day of glory. And in a day to come, the Lord will return personally and bring an end to suffering and death for all His Creation.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: Before coming to Christ, my partner and I made a commitment to each other and started a family. However, we are not legally married. Now that I am a believer, I&#39;m unsure what to do. If I move out, it seems like it&#39;s a divorce and I separate my children from their father, but if I stay together with him, am I in a sinful relationship?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A: For all intents and purposes, you are married already. While you may not have a legal marriage license as yet, a license from the government is merely a formality at this point. Both of you have obviously made a commitment to one another, brought children into the world and have every intention of continuing together in this relationship. Your commitment to one another is confirmed&nbsp;by the fact you would view any separation as equivalent to a divorce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, your situation is similar to the one Paul described in 1Cor 7:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 7:10&nbsp; But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband<br />\n1Cor. 7:11&nbsp;(but if she does leave, she must remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband should not divorce his wife.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 7:12&nbsp; But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 7:13&nbsp;And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to live with her, she must not send her husband away.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 7:14&nbsp;For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In this passage, Paul was addressing the question of whether a woman who comes to faith while married to an unbeliever should leave her unbelieving husband. Paul says specifically that as long as the unbelieving husband agrees to remain in the relationship, the woman is required to stay in the marriage. There is&nbsp;potential for her to witness in the family and bring her husband and children to faith, which is reason enough to remain in the marriage. In the meantime, a Christian wife and mother will serve to sanctify the family (i.e., provide a godly influence).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we believe you should remain married, and moreover, we strongly recommend you&nbsp;formalize your relationship by pursuing a legal marriage as a means of protecting&nbsp;your Christian witness within society. Though we believe the Lord views you as a married couple already, nevertheless many church congregations might consider a couple living together absent a legal marriage to be living in sin. Therefore if possible, we recommend you gently persuade your husband to obtain a marriage license. Regardless of his answer, remain with him and serve the Lord where you are.</p>\n\n<p>You may find our <a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\" target=\"_blank\">1Corinthians study</a> helpful, especially the lessons on chapter 7.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: I&#39;m a nurse. Is it sinful for me to view a naked human body?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A: The Bible declares that witnessing a naked human body can be sinful, but it is not always sinful.&nbsp;A Christian serving as a doctor or nurse may be called to view a naked human body in the course of providing life-saving treatment. Under&nbsp;these circumstances, the believer has not sinned since their purpose in viewing the body is godly and not intended to provoke lustful thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, one of the authors of the New Testament, Luke, was himself a doctor (see Colossians 4:14).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, so long as a&nbsp;believer is capable of serving in this capacity&nbsp;without&nbsp;experiencing lustful thoughts, then the believer is able to&nbsp;serve without sin.&nbsp;(Please read the following article for more background on this issue:<a href=\"/bible-answers/why_is_watching_pornography_sinful\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/why_is_watching_pornography_sinful\">Is Watching </a><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/why_is_watching_pornography_sinful\">Pornography</a><a href=\"/bible-answers/why_is_watching_pornography_sinful\">&nbsp;Sinful?.</a></p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if a&nbsp;believer&nbsp;experiences lustful thoughts&nbsp;in the presence of unclothed patients, then that person should strongly&nbsp;consider&nbsp;whether a medical career is&nbsp;conducive to his or her spiritual&nbsp;growth and godliness. It is more important that a believer change professions if necessary to protect himself or herself from sin than to&nbsp;remain in a preferred career and suffer continual&nbsp;temptation into sin, as Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 5:30&nbsp;&ldquo;If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to go into hell.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Does the Bible teach that the Earth is round or flat?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A: The Christian faith recognizes the Bible above all other&nbsp;sources of knowledge as the inspired word of God. Teaching that contradicts the Bible is false, by definition. On the other hand, the Bible is not the sole source of knowledge in Creation.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Bible does not attempt to teach mathematics, chemistry, biology or many other areas of knowledge that are self-evidently true despite being absent in God&#39;s word. Therefore, we cannot become blind to obvious truths of nature, nor should we dismiss or ignore extra-biblical sources of truth&nbsp;so long as they do not contradict scripture.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the earth&#39;s shape, scripture never&nbsp;explicitly states&nbsp;the shape of our planet, but it does confirm a round earth implicitly in various places. For example, the Creation account in Genesis 1 describes all the land as existing \"in one place\" in Genesis 1:9 while all waters are gathered likewise. Geometrically, this can only happen on a sphere, and therefore Genesis 1 implies a round earth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, science&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_Earth\" target=\"_blank\">long ago</a> confirmed the spherical shape of the earth. As early as the 6th century B.C., men had mathematical proofs demonstrating the earth is spherical in shape. In the following centuries, many scientists have devised simple experiments validating the earth is a sphere,&nbsp;and more recently high-altitude aircraft, satellites orbiting our planet, and manned space travel have confirmed those earlier findings.</p>\n\n<p>Even our own observations from the ground confirm the earth to be a sphere. In the photo below, notice how the curvature of the earth cuts off the bottom of the buildings on the distant shore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Horizon,_Valencia_(Spain).JPG\" style=\"opacity: 0.9; width: 700px; height: 525px;\" /></p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;\n<p>Simply put, men have known the earth was round for centuries, and the Bible confirms this truth implicitly. Unfortunately, some Christians have become victims of false teaching and conspiracy theories that&nbsp;misinterpret various&nbsp;scriptures to support&nbsp;bizarre conclusions.&nbsp;The claim of&nbsp;a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; earth is one such false teaching.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We should note that the Bible says any trend of denying&nbsp;obvious truths while promoting&nbsp;novel and seductive spiritual myths is&nbsp;indicative of the end times. Paul says this concerning the church of the last days:</p>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 4:3&nbsp;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,&nbsp;<br />\n2Tim. 4:4&nbsp;and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The popularity of &ldquo;flat earth&rdquo; teaching among a few deceived believers is indicative of the enemy&#39;s efforts to distract believers from Kingdom work with sensationalistic&nbsp;myths. Paul says learning sound doctrine requires endurance, but some would prefer to have their ears tickled. The enemy uses attractive myths like a flat earth to distract believers from the truly important matters of scripture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we exhort believers to set aside these matters entirely. Do not waste time in endless and unprofitable arguments on one side or the other of these myths.&nbsp;Return to scripture seeking a meaningful understanding of Christ and your walk with Him that will profit you into eternity.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: Was Paul speaking in </em></strong><strong><em>third</em></strong><strong><em> person (about himself) in 2 Corinthians 12:2-4?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA: Paul spoke in the third person in 1Corinthians 12 to make a point to his readers about the dangers of pride. As an apostle, Paul was uniquely equipped by the Lord, and yet Paul did not allow his privileges in ministry to go to his head. So he wished to use himself as a model for the prideful Corinthians without succumbing to pride in the process of his \"boasting.\" In short, Paul didn&#39;t want to become proud of his humility.</p>\n\n<p>The Corinthians were celebrating those who boasted about themselves and their personal power. For example, Paul says in the prior chapter:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 11:19&nbsp;For you, being so wise, tolerate the foolish gladly.<br />\n2Cor. 11:20&nbsp;For you tolerate it if anyone enslaves you, anyone devours you, anyone takes advantage of you, anyone exalts himself, anyone hits you in the face.</h5>\n\n<p>Perversely, the more boastful and abusive a person was, the more the Corinthians respected them. Consequently, Paul being a humble and unassuming man was diminished in their sight, which led the Corinthians to give less credence to Paul&rsquo;s teaching despite being an apostle without equal in the church. This was a dangerous situation for the church since the Corinthians were giving attention to false teachers in place of Paul&rsquo;s sound teaching. As Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 11:21&nbsp;To my shame I must say that we have been weak by comparison. But in whatever respect anyone else is bold &mdash; I speak in foolishness &mdash; I am just as bold myself.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul says his was (seen as) weak by comparison by the church in Corinth, so Paul decides to engage in this boasting competition though he knows it is a foolish thing to compete for the respect of carnal men in this way. Paul is taking a risk in lowering himself to their level so he can gain their attention and respect for better teaching,&nbsp;not because he wished to exalt himself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To walk this tightrope between demonstrating humility before the Lord and boasting before the Corinthians, Paul speaks in the third person while describing his qualifications. This technique works to distance Paul somewhat from his accomplishments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Notice how he begins his &ldquo;boasting&rdquo; competition by acknowledging the silliness of the whole affair:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 11:22&nbsp;Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 11:23&nbsp;Are they servants of Christ? &mdash; I speak as if insane &mdash; I more so; in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in danger of death.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul stops in the middle of listing his credentials to remark that this speech was so uncharacteristic for him, and therefore&nbsp;he wondered aloud if he was insane to be engaging in it. Paul was sincerely bothered by his need to engage in self-promotion since all boasting is sin, yet he does so under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit out of necessity to gain the church&rsquo;s respect for the word of God.</p>\n\n<p>Paul&#39;s so-called boasting reaches its climax in chapter 12, when Paul reveals how he came to know so much about God&rsquo;s will for His church. Paul reveals he was granted a unique and unprecedented audience in heaven (though he isn&rsquo;t sure exactly how he experienced it)&nbsp;where he was taught the depths of theology he later revealed in his New Testament letters. Paul cites this experience as the chief argument for his superiority as a messenger of God, which he introduces with this statement:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 12:1&nbsp;Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Once again, Paul says this exercise in boasting is distasteful and not profitable as an example. Nevertheless, he presses forward to demonstrate why his teaching is superior to all others in the church. Paul announces he go on to share that he received \"visions and revelations\" from the Lord.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This statement is our first contextual clue in the letter to know that what follows is, in fact, a story about Paul&nbsp;and not someone else even though Paul wrote in the third person. Paul writes the account in the third person to minimize the degree of his personal boasting, much in the same way we might refer to ourselves in the third person to avoid embarrassment over some situation (i.e., &ldquo;I have a &ldquo;friend\" who needs help&hellip;&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p>Later in chapter 12, Paul confirms that his third-person account was speaking of himself when he adds:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 12:5&nbsp;On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses.&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 12:6&nbsp;For if I do wish to boast I will not be foolish, for I will be speaking the truth; but I refrain from this, so that no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me.&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 12:7&nbsp;Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me &mdash; to keep me from exalting myself!&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 12:8&nbsp;Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me.&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 12:9&nbsp;And He has said to me, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.&rdquo; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice Paul says he boasts &ldquo;on behalf of such a man&rdquo; but he won&rsquo;t boast on his behalf. He&rsquo;s explaining why he&rsquo;s speaking in the third person about himself. He says the only thing he will say about himself (in the first person) is that he has weaknesses. This was a sincere reflection of Paul&rsquo;s humility. Paul was so embarrassed by his self-promotion that he softened the impact by writing in&nbsp;a third-person voice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in v.7 Paul says that the Lord granted Paul an infirmity to counteract Paul&#39;s pride precisely because of the great revelations Paul received in Heaven. The same man who received the revelations is the one who received the &ldquo;thorn.&rdquo; Since Paul received the thorn, we know that Paul is also the one who received the visions and revelations mentioned earlier in the chapter. The &ldquo;great revelations&rdquo; Paul described were those just mentioned in the third person</p>\n\n<p>Since Paul received the great revelations in the throne room of God, he was given a trial to counteract his pride.&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know what specific trial Paul received, but it was enough to keep his pride in check. So the way Paul introduced and concluded his third-person account tells us conclusively he was speaking of himself.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q:&nbsp;Will there be animal sacrifices in the Millennial age?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A: According to Ezekiel&rsquo;s description of the temple in chapters 44-46, there will be sacrifices in the&nbsp;Millennial temple. There will be sacrifices will serve to commemorate the Passover, the Sabbath and other feasts. Of these feasts, only one will be required of Gentiles, the Feast of Tabernacles. We read this in Zechariah 14:</p>\n\n<h5>Zech. 14:16&nbsp; Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.&nbsp;<br />\nZech. 14:17&nbsp;And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, there will be no rain on them.&nbsp;<br />\nZech. 14:18&nbsp;If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the Lord smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.&nbsp;<br />\nZech. 14:19&nbsp;This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. &nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>A failure to obey this requirement brings a punishment of plagues and drought, indicating that some nations will continue to rebel against the Lord in the Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The sacrifices of the Kingdom are part of a Kingdom Law which is different than the Law of Moses. The Law of Moses ended with the death of Christ, but the Kingdom Law will be instituted in the Kingdom. This law as explained in Ezekiel 40-43 includes animal sacrifices&nbsp;similar to the Law of Moses though different in some ways.</p>\n\n<p>Just as the Old Testament sacrifices did not remit sin, nor with the Kingdom sacrifices be a means to righteousness or forgiveness for sins. Rather, these rituals will be a means of restoring&nbsp;fellowship for sinners living in the Kingdom and as memorial of Jesus&#39; redemptive sacrifice&nbsp;in the prior age.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Remember, every age since Israel&#39;s formation has included a temple and a sacrificial service. Even in the age of the Church, there is a temple on earth and a sacrifice. The Bible says that the temple today is found in the body of all believers:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God&rsquo;s household,<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Eph. 2:20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Eph. 2:21 in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Eph. 2:22 in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.</span></h5>\n\n<p>And today there is a sacrifice for the Lord, as Paul explains:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 12:1 &nbsp;Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>For a more detailed explanation of the Kingdom life and temple service, please listen to our Revelation Bible study, especially <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Lessons 20B &amp; C</a>.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q:&nbsp;How do we put Matthew 7:6 into practice even as we work to share the G</em></strong><strong><em>ospel</em></strong><strong><em>? Should we share the G</em></strong><strong><em>ospel</em></strong><strong><em> with all people or only selectively&nbsp;with some?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A: In Matthew 7 we read:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 7:6&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.</h5>\n\n<p>In this well-known statement, Jesus uses a parable&nbsp;to instruct His followers not to take the precious spiritual things they&rsquo;ve received from the Spirit and offer them to those who cannot appreciate them and will only use them to mock the Lord God and us.</p>\n\n<p>In the parable, Jesus compares the precious truths found in God&rsquo;s word to pearls. Believers come to understand spiritual truth by God&rsquo;s grace through His word as revealed by the Spirit working in us. These things are not knowable by the flesh, so without the Spirit of God, a person cannot appreciate spiritual truth. It remains a mystery. Therefore, a follower of Jesus should be careful to avoid entering into&nbsp;unprofitable conversations with an unbeliever who will only mock or insult the revelations of God.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Gospel message itself is <em><strong>not</strong></em> the &ldquo;pearls&rdquo; Jesus is describing in this parable. On the contrary, sharing with unbelievers the truth of Jesus as the Savior Who came and died to save the lost is the very mission of the Church! Jesus Himself modeled this practice as He shared the Gospel with large crowds as did His apostles after Him. Likewise, Paul frequently attempted to persuade unbelieving Jews in synagogues of the truth of the Gospel in spite of the fact that his arguments were usually rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, sharing the Gospel with people who are resistant to this truth is not prohibited by Matthew 7:6, and therefore, Jesus&rsquo; command is referring&nbsp;to other spiritual truth beyond the Gospel message itself. Pearls are spiritual truths appropriate only to believers, including the Bible&#39;s revelation of God&rsquo;s program for the end of the age, the Church&rsquo;s mission on earth, the believer&#39;s future life in the kingdom, among other truths. These&nbsp;&ldquo;pearls\" of spiritual wisdom are revealed to believers by the Spirit, so we should guard them and share them only among those who also have the Spirit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If we share these pearls indiscriminately with&nbsp;unbelievers who we know cannot appreciate them, then we only invite their scorn, mocking, and even attacks&nbsp;as Jesus said. This is an unwise ministry, and it may cast scorn upon&nbsp;our the Lord. We should remember that unless and until a person receives the Spirit of God by faith in Jesus Christ, they remain incapable of knowing the things of God. Consequently, the only message that is appropriate for us to share with an unbeliever is the Gospel itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In another moment in the Gospels, Jesus modeled how we can discern a person&rsquo;s readiness for deeper spiritual truths. In Matthew 15 Jesus was approached by a Gentile woman with a request for His attention and healing:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 15:21&nbsp; Jesus went away from there, and withdrew into the district of Tyre and Sidon.&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 15:22 &nbsp;And a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out, saying, &ldquo;Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is cruelly demon-possessed.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 15:23 &nbsp;But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, &ldquo;Send her away, because she keeps shouting at us.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 15:24 &nbsp;But He answered and said, &ldquo;I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&rdquo;<br />\nMatt. 15:25 &nbsp;But she came and began to bow down before Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, help me!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 15:26 &nbsp;And He answered and said, &ldquo;It is not good to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the dogs.&rdquo;<br />\nMatt. 15:27 &nbsp;But she said, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters&rsquo; table.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 15:28 &nbsp;Then Jesus said to her, &ldquo;O woman, your faith is great; it shall be done for you as you wish.&rdquo; And her daughter was healed at once.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice initially how Jesus did not engage with the woman. He says He was not willing to extend His personal ministry beyond the people of Israel, to whom He has been sent according to the promises of God. On the other hand, Jesus neither rejected the woman when the disciples suggested He do so. Jesus neither met her demands&nbsp;nor rejected her either until He understood her state of&nbsp;heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So He tested her heart by stating a spirit truth and then watched her reaction to that truth. In her case, Jesus declared&nbsp;that He could not offer holy things to &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; (i.e., Gentiles). His was saying that the Messiah was promised to the nation of Israel, so He must prioritize&nbsp;serving Israel over&nbsp;sharing the truth with Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>His statement was a spiritual truth hidden in a metaphor to test the woman&#39;s heart. If the woman were an unbeliever, she would have lacked the spiritual insight to grasp the point of the metaphor. In that case, Jesus would then have known she was not a true disciple and would not have served her request. Jesus was testing her heart by&nbsp;her response.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In this case, the woman&nbsp;responded with an understanding of Jesus&#39; spiritual principle. She uses Jesus&#39; metaphor to acknowledge&nbsp;that the program of the Messiah was centered on the Jewish people, but she also knew from Old Testament prophecy&nbsp;that God also intended to bless the Gentiles through the Jewish Messiah&nbsp;in keeping with God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham in Genesis 22.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Canaanite woman understood an important spiritual truth&nbsp;that the Gentiles would be permitted to receive the Messiah&nbsp;in due time, so she challenged Jesus to acknowledge her faith in Him now and grant the healing she requested, which Jesus did.&nbsp;Her response demonstrated Spirit-given insight, which told Jesus she ready for greater \"pearls.\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While we don&rsquo;t possess the divine insight of Christ, obviously, we do have the potential to follow His pattern in this example&nbsp;to some degree. We should look for&nbsp;the opportunities in our conversations with others to probe their&nbsp;understanding of spiritual truths. Once we gain a better sense of a person&rsquo;s spiritual state, then we can determine how to proceed in the discussions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If a person indicates they no nothing of Christ or the spiritual truths of the Bible (or if they are confused on biblical principles like salvation or Christ), then we should freely offer&nbsp;them the Gospel while avoiding discussions of deeper matters of the faith, which they cannot understand and will only &ldquo;trample&rdquo; by making a fool of you and Christ.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if they indicate they know Christ and can relate to basic spiritual truths, then we are free to shift gears into sharing &ldquo;pearls&rdquo; with them as the Spirit offers opportunity.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Will all believers experience two deaths (i.e., a spiritual and physical death)?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>A</strong>: The Bible teaches that mankind consists of two parts: <a href=\"/bible-answers/explain_where_we_go_when_we_die\">spirit and body</a>. Furthermore, all men and women die because of sin. Both the death of the soul and the body are&nbsp;included in this principle, but in both cases, there are exceptions to the principle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, if a person believes in Jesus Christ (i.e., is a Christian), then that person will not experience the Second Death, which is the death of the soul:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 2:11&nbsp;&lsquo;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the&nbsp;second death.&rsquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>Rev. 20:6&nbsp;Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the&nbsp;second death&nbsp;has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years. &nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice in both these verses, the believer in Jesus Christ will not experience the second death, which is the Bible&#39;s term for the spirit being separated from God for eternity. The only way for a person to avoid the eternal death of the soul is to accept the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ in his or her place. Though sin leads to the death of the soul, Jesus took that penalty on our behalf so&nbsp;we would not experience it personally by our faith in Him.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, some believers will not experience physical death either. The death of the body was instituted by God in Genesis 3 when the Lord declared a curse on the earth. Since the physical body of Adam came from the earth, his body was cursed along with the earth. This curse requires that the body pass away so a new body may come in its place (<em>see Genesis 3:19</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While most human beings will experience the passing of their earthly bodies through physical death, some believers are promised to avoid that experience and pass directly from the fallen body to a new eternal body at the Resurrection (sometimes called the \"<a href=\"/bible-answers/how_do_we_know_there_will_be_a_rapture\">rapture</a>\"). This event still satisfies the Lord&rsquo;s requirement that our earthly body return to dust since we will leave it behind at the resurrection, but the soul of the individual will move directly into the new body without experience the dying process. In a sense, the old body still dies (when the soul is instantaneously removed from it), but the individual will not personally experience the dying process. Paul says it this way:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 15:51&nbsp;Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 15:52&nbsp;in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So the principle that all die because of sin is still true, but in the case of Christians, all will escape spiritual death and a few will even escape experiencing&nbsp;physical death.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q:&nbsp;How do we know who has the Spirit of Christ?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A: While anyone can claim to be in Christ (i.e., a born-again Christian), only those who have the Spirit of God are truly of Christ. For example, in Acts 8 we learn of a man who desired to be associated with Christians and Christianity, but he didn&rsquo;t possess the Spirit by faith, and therefore he was deemed to be an unbeliever:</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 8:18&nbsp;Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was bestowed through the laying on of the apostles&rsquo; hands, he offered them money,&nbsp;<br />\nActs 8:19&nbsp;saying, &ldquo;Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nActs 8:20&nbsp;But Peter said to him, &ldquo;May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!&nbsp;<br />\nActs 8:21&nbsp;&ldquo;You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.&nbsp;<br />\nActs 8:22&nbsp;&ldquo;Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven you.&nbsp;<br />\nActs 8:23&nbsp;&ldquo;For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not surprising that men&nbsp;claim to have the Spirit even when they do not. The unbelieving world cannot understand what they do not possess, so from their limited perspective, they can only assume that Christianity is an association or relationship with other people, when in reality it is a spiritual relationship with the living God through His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we know if a person is truly Christian? Our ability to discern true faith in another individual will always be limited and prone to error since true faith is a spiritual (i.e., invisible) relationship. Nevertheless, scripture teaches that true faith produces fruit by&nbsp;the Spirit in the life of a believer:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 7:15&nbsp; &ldquo;Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.<br />\nMatt. 7:16&nbsp;&ldquo;You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?<br />\nMatt. 7:17&nbsp;&ldquo;So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.<br />\nMatt. 7:18&nbsp;&ldquo;A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.<br />\nMatt. 7:19&nbsp;&ldquo;Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.<br />\nMatt. 7:20&nbsp;&ldquo;So then, you will know them by their fruits.<br />\nMatt. 7:21&nbsp; &ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, &lsquo;Lord, Lord,&rsquo; will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.</h5>\n\n<p>Jesus warns that we may know people by their (spiritual) fruit. Likewise, Paul says the fruit of the Spirit in the life of a believer will stand in stark contrast to the easily recognizable sin in the life of an unbeliever:</p>\n\n<h5>Gal. 5:19&nbsp;Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality,&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 5:20&nbsp;idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 5:21&nbsp;envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 5:22&nbsp;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 5:23&nbsp;gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 5:24&nbsp;Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 5:25&nbsp;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>As we see spiritual changes taking place in a believer&#39;s life, we can gain confidence in their testimony of faith in Jesus Christ. On the other hand, how much fruit is enough to satisfy our inspection? This question highlights the dangers of becoming \"fruit inspectors\" within the body of Christ. Our inherent inability to perfectly discern true faith among very immature Christians should cause us to refrain from such judgments in most cases. Only in situations where a person is seeking a leadership or teaching positions within the body should we take up the challenge of validating their testimony of faith.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For a more teaching on this topic, we recommend the following articles:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/bible-answers/baptism_in_the_spirit\">Baptism in the Spirit</a><br />\n<a href=\"/bible-answers/how_do_i_know_for_sure_i_am_saved\">How do I know for sure I am saved?</a></p>\n\n<p>Also, please listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans</a> and <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-studies/galatians\">Galatians</a> Bible studies available for free.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: What is the significance of numbers in the Bible? Where can I find an overview of what these numbers mean?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA: The symbolic significance of a number&nbsp;used in scripture is usually not provided in the Bible explicitly. Instead, the symbolic meaning of any number can be determined implicitly by observing the way the Lord uses numbers consistently to convey symbolic meaning. As we observe the consistent way God&rsquo;s uses certain numbers, we can learn a number&rsquo;s symbolic meaning.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we&nbsp;observe the Lord&rsquo;s use of the number seven (7, 70, 777, 7000, etc.) across scripture. Beginning at the Creation and continuing throughout the pages of the Bible, the Lord consistently uses the number 7 to stand for the completion of something.</p>\n\n<p>In the same way that mathematics use 100% to represent the whole of something, the Lord has chosen to use the number 7 to convey the same idea symbolically. The Bible never explicitly states that 7 means &ldquo;completion\" or &ldquo;perfection,&rdquo; but by&nbsp;careful observation we can easily see this meaning associated with that number. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, as other numbers are used consistently throughout scripture, we come to understand their meaning by observing this consistency. Obviously, discerning the meaning of numbers depends on practicing careful observation skills and detecting patterns, but this can be done with practice. As Pastor Armstrong teaches on the meaning of a number, he is simply applying these rules to his personal exposition of the text.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You may find the following <a href=\"http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/number01.htm\">summary of the meaning of numbers</a> helpful.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

As Paul teaches:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 12:4&nbsp; Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:5&nbsp;And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:6&nbsp;There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons.<br />\n1Cor. 12:7&nbsp;But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:8&nbsp;For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:9&nbsp;to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:10&nbsp;and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:11&nbsp;But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice in v.11 Paul says God assigns gifts to believers \"as He wills.\" God is the One by His Spirit Who assigns all gifts, and a believer receives whatever gifts the Spirit wills to give. Furthermore, these gifts are permanent:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 11:29&nbsp;for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, anyone who teaches that spiritual gifts can be &ldquo;transferred&rdquo; or learned is distorting the teaching of the Bible, and therefore you should seek for better teaching elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We encourage you to listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\" target=\"_blank\">1Corinthians study</a>, especially chapters 12-14 on spiritual gifts.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: What is the meaning of Revelation 7:27, when it says God will rule with an iron rod and smash the nations? Is it speaking about believers or unbelievers?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>In Revelation 2 we read this:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 2:27&nbsp;and he shall&nbsp;rule them with a&nbsp;rod of iron,&nbsp;as the vessels of the potter are broken to pieces, as I also have received authority from My Father;</h5>\n\n<p>This passage is a quote from Psalm 2:9. To understand the meaning of this quote, we must visit the context of the entire passage in the Old Testament:</p>\n\n<h5>Psa. 2:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why are the nations in an uproar&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the peoples devising a vain thing?&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 2:2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The kings of the earth take their stand&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the rulers take counsel together&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying,&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 2:3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Let us tear their fetters apart&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And cast away their cords from us!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 2:4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He who sits in the heavens laughs,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Lord scoffs at them.&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 2:5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then He will speak to them in His anger&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And terrify them in His fury, saying,&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 2:6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;But as for Me, I have installed My King&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Upon Zion, My holy mountain.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 2:7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I will surely tell of the decree of the Lord:&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He said to Me, &lsquo;You are My Son,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Today I have begotten You.&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 2:8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lsquo;Ask of Me, and I will surely give the nations as Your inheritance,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the very ends of the earth as Your possession.&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 2:9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lsquo;You shall break them with a rod of iron,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You shall shatter them like earthenware.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>From this context, we can find numerous details that reveal the time and circumstances the Psalmist is describing. First, all the nations of the Earth are in an &ldquo;uproar.&rdquo; They are conspiring in vanity to challenge the authority of God Himself. The kings of the earth are working together against the Messiah, the Anointed of God. They desire to rob Him of His power to rule over them.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, these are not believers. They are set against the Lord&rsquo;s authority, and their prideful, sinful hearts are seeking to rebel. Meanwhile, the Lord is scoffing at their pathetic plans to defeat His power on earth. The Lord promises to speak to them in anger and in fury, denying them a victory and installing the Messiah as King of the Earth in Jerusalem on His holy mountain.</p>\n\n<p>The Lord promises to make His Son the King and grant to Him an inheritance to the ends of the earth. All the Earth will become Christ&rsquo;s possession, which He will rule with absolute authority. He will break rebellion and shatter the strength of those sinful nations wishing to challenge His authority. We know these things are fulfilled in the Second Coming of the Lord, when He sets up His Kingdom on earth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the phrase quoted in Revelation 2 from Psalm 2 is&nbsp;a reference to Christ ruling over the nations of the earth during the Millennial Kingdom. That rule will be over all natural men living in the Kingdom, both unbelievers and believers. On the other hand, it does not apply to the glorified saints who have received new, eternal bodies at the resurrection.</p>\n\n<p>Turning back to Revelation 2, we see how Jesus applied this truth from Psalm 2 to the church:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 2:26 &nbsp;&lsquo;He who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations;<br />\nRev. 2:27 &nbsp;and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to pieces, as I also have received authority from My Father;<br />\nRev. 2:28 &nbsp;and I will give him the morning star.</h5>\n\n<p>Jesus promises that to the one who overcomes (i.e., who comes to saving faith in Jesus...<em>see 1John 5:4</em>), Jesus will grant authority over the nations of the Kingdom. Once again, these are the nations of the world who populate the Kingdom on earth. These nations will include natural men, both believers and unbelievers, who requiring ruling&nbsp;because they occupy fallen bodies still prone to sin. As Jesus rules with authority over the nations, He grants resurrected saints the opportunity to rule over the nations with Him according to Revelation 20:4.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For a thorough explanation of the citizens of the Kingdom, please consult our <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation Bible study </a>available for free.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Can you explain what Paul means by tongues being a \"gift of speaking mysteries\" Does this mean that tongues are always intended to be a mysterious, unknowable \"spiritual\"&nbsp;language?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A: First, let&rsquo;s review where Paul says in 1Corinthians 14 that speaking in tongues is a gift of speaking mysteries:</p>\n\n<h5>1 Cor. 14:2&nbsp;For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice Paul is writing from the perspective of the one doing the speaking. Paul says that from the speaker&rsquo;s perspective, his own speech is unknowable and a mystery. This is true because when&nbsp;a person speaks in tongues under the influence of the Holy Spirit, he will speak in&nbsp;a normal, <strong><a href=\"/bible-answers/is_speaking_in_tongues_biblical\">understandable human language</a></strong>,&nbsp;though it is a language the speaker himself does not&nbsp;understand. That is the essence of the miracle of speaking in tongues.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the gift tongues is a miracle (i.e., a work done by the Spirit) which lies beyond the ability of a person&rsquo;s natural ability.&nbsp;Paul says \"no one\" will understand the speech, meaning that not even the one who speaks in tongues will understand his or her speech.&nbsp;Therefore, to the speaker himself the language of tongues is unknowable and a mystery, but this does not mean that tongues&nbsp;consists of babbling sounds of a mysterious origin.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, \"tongue\"&nbsp;is simply the Bible&#39;s word for a foreign language. If a&nbsp;tongue consisted of mysterious, unknowable sounds rather than normal human language as some suggest, then what do we conclude about the events of Pentecost that occurred in Acts 2? As we demonstrated in&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"/bible-answers/is_speaking_in_tongues_biblical\">our article</a></strong>, the tongues&nbsp;spoken&nbsp;in that moment were&nbsp;normal foreign languages as evidenced by the way foreigners in the crowd understood the speech perfectly (<em>see Acts 2:8-11</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, that moment in Acts 2 was the beginning of the gift of speaking in tongues in the Church. Therefore,&nbsp;we must define \"tongues\" according to the example set at that moment. Since the tongues of Acts 2 were normal human language, we must expect the gift of tongues to always include normal human languages, not babbling nonsense. The only reason for someone to propose a new&nbsp;definition of tongues as a&nbsp;&ldquo;mysterious and unknowable&rdquo; language would be&nbsp;a pretext for permitting the mindless babbling that falsely poses as the gift of tongues in so many places today.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, the Bible requires that tongues <strong><em>must be knowable</em></strong> or else it must be silenced in the gathering. Paul required that an interpreter&nbsp;always&nbsp;is&nbsp;present&nbsp;when the gift of tongues was manifested in the gathering or else the speech was to be silenced in the body. If words \"tongues\" meant a language that literally&nbsp;&ldquo;no one&rdquo; can understand, then how could Paul require an interpreter&nbsp;be present as he does in 1Corinthians 14:27? Obviously, Paul expected the language to be understandable to at least someone in the&nbsp;room since this was his pre-requisite for the use of tongues. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The spiritual gift of interpretation is the complementary gift God assigns to ensure the content of any foreign language share in the gathering is still understandable by the audience. In addition to the gift of interpretation, a person who naturally knows the foreign language being spoken&nbsp;would also be able to understand and explain it to everyone (as demonstrated in the moment of Pentecost from Acts 2).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we must conclude that the activity that often poses as tongues today is not the true gift of tongues but is merely a modern, learned behavior with no historical or biblical precedent.&nbsp;False teachers have concocted this false teaching of a \"mysterious\" spiritual language by twisting Paul&#39;s teaching as a&nbsp;cover for their unbiblical practice of encouraging babbling nonsense speech. Repetitive sounds have never been considered a tongue in scripture, neither in the spiritual realm nor&nbsp;the human realm. In fact, Paul calls such practice ungodly:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 14:33&nbsp;for God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Finally, here are some simple biblical tests you can apply to know if your practice (or anyone else&rsquo;s practice) of tongues is, in fact, a gift from the Spirit and according to the Lord&rsquo;s will or merely a product of human flesh:</p>\n\n<p>1. Could someone mimic the exact sounds you are making? If so, it&rsquo;s not the gift of tongues. It is merely a learned behavior, and when you engage in this so-called &ldquo;gift,&rdquo; does the entire room make similar sounds with you in unison? If so, then this is not a work of the spirit but flesh, for God alone appoints gifts and His word declares that not everyone in the body will receive the same gift according to Paul:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 12:5&nbsp;And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:6&nbsp;There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons.<br />\n1Cor. 12:7&nbsp;But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:8&nbsp;For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:9&nbsp;to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:10&nbsp;and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 12:11&nbsp;But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>2. Does your speech convey a message in normal human terms (i.e., a language with syntax, vocabulary, sentence structure)? If not, it&rsquo;s just babbling nonsense and not a product of the Spirit, for the Lord is not a Lord of confusion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 14:8&nbsp;For if the bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle?&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 14:9&nbsp;So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</h5>\n\n<p>Once more, if your babbling can be mimicked (and all babbling can be &ldquo;taught&rdquo; and mimicked), then it cannot be a spiritual gift. Spiritual gifts cannot be taught nor learned, since they are always a self-evident display of God&rsquo;s power, never a demonstration of man&rsquo;s flesh.</p>\n\n<p>3. Finally, is your speaking in tongues always accompanied by sensible interpretation as Paul required? Is such speech silenced when no interpretation is present? Are interpretations confirmed by other means to ensure they are not false themselves? Are speakers limited to only 2 or 3 speaking per gathering as&nbsp;Paul commanded:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 14:26&nbsp; What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 14:27&nbsp;If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and one must interpret;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 14:28&nbsp;but if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 14:29&nbsp;Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others pass judgment.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>If Paul&#39;s instructions&nbsp;are not followed, then you can know that the practice is not by scripture or the Spirit, and therefore, the activity is self-evidently not of God because the Spirit will not lead a believer into behaviors that contradict God&rsquo;s word. Therefore, these behaviors must be the product of the enemy or the flesh.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Should Christians avoid secular things (i.e., abstaining from birth control, television, music, movies, etc.)&nbsp;to get closer to God?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A: The Bible makes clear that our righteousness is not obtained through our personal works. It is imputed to us by our faith in Jesus Christ. As Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 4:4&nbsp;Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.<br />\nRom. 4:5&nbsp;But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, if we have Christ&rsquo;s righteousness credited to us by faith, then no work we do can add to our justification. Furthermore, the Bible says the Christian has liberty in many areas of life since we do not have specific restrictions or laws that can ensure our righteousness. Our faith alone in Christ alone assures us of Christ&#39;s righteousness.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, our liberty cannot become license to engage in sin. Instead, the Christian is called to restrain the flesh and walk in the Spirit so as to please the Lord. <a href=\"http://Asceticism\">Asceticism</a> is a practice of&nbsp;self-discipline or avoidance of indulgence to please God through a denial of the flesh. Depending on an individual&rsquo;s motivation and purpose in this practice, it could be appropriate for a Christian in some forms.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if a Christian is led by the Spirit into a period of fasting, then this form of asceticism would be biblical. On the other hand, if a person practiced abusive treatment of the body to&nbsp;put an end to sin and please God, such a practice would be both wrong and useless as Paul teaches:</p>\n\n<h5>Col. 2:20&nbsp; If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as,&nbsp;<br />\nCol. 2:21&nbsp;&ldquo;Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nCol. 2:22&nbsp;(which all refer to things destined to perish with use) &mdash; in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men?&nbsp;<br />\nCol. 2:23&nbsp;These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>As Paul taught, self-abasement and severe treatment of the body is not a means to self-discipline or pleasing God. Instead, we must focus on biblical ways to strengthen the spirit, not waste time trying to degrade the flesh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Concerning the specific practices you listed (e.g., abstaining from birth control, television, music, movies, etc.), these choices fall into the realm of liberty. Each Christian has liberty to do as he or she feels led in these matters, and no Christian may stand in judgment over another Christian&rsquo;s choices. As Paul wrote:</p>\n\n<h5>Col. 2:16&nbsp; Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day &mdash;&nbsp;<br />\nCol. 2:17&nbsp;things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>There is no inherently right or wrong way to live in these areas, apart from our requirement to seek for godliness in everything we do as Paul directed:</p>\n\n<h5>Phil. 4:8&nbsp; Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>However, if a Christian is pressured into acting contrary to his or her conscience in matters of liberty, then that Christian will have been made to stumble by excessive liberty, as James taught:</p>\n\n<h5>James 4:17&nbsp;Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>We must take care not to intrude on the personal decisions of others in matters of liberty and thereby to cause them to stumble in their conscience. Leave room for differences without judgment, as Paul commanded:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 14:10&nbsp; But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 14:11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For it is written,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And every tongue shall give praise to God.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 14:12&nbsp;So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 14:13&nbsp; Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather determine this &mdash; not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother&rsquo;s way.&nbsp;</h5>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Are women permanently punished forevermore to be ruled over by men in general or just by their husbands? If this is true how am I as a woman supposed to desire marriage? I am no slave to anyone and don&#39;t wish to be ruled over by a man or anyone other than my LORD.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Regarding Genesis 3, the words spoken to Woman are often misunderstood. Therefore, our ministry offers an in-depth, verse-by-verse teaching through the entire book of Genesis, including chapter 3, that will answer all your questions thoroughly. We highly recommend you listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis Bible study</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we can offer a brief commentary on your statements. First, the Lord did not require that all women be ruled by all men. The Lord only determined that in the context of marriage a wife is under the authority of her husband.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the Lord didn&rsquo;t appoint Woman to be a slave to Man. Instead, the Woman was&nbsp;called to respect and obey her husband, and submission is not the same thing&nbsp;as slavery. Consider other examples of submission from society. Are you employed? If so, then you must respect and obey your employer or manager. Do you consider yourself a slave under those circumstances? We assume not.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, all citizens of a country must obey and respect the authority of their nation&rsquo;s leaders, judges, police, etc. When we show a judge respect or when we obey the laws of your country, does this make us&nbsp;&ldquo;slaves?&rdquo; Obviously, the answer again is no.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Such is the relationship between a wife and a husband. The wife is called to recognize&nbsp;her husband&rsquo;s authority as God has determined it should be for the benefit of the family and His eternal purposes. She submits to her husband&rsquo;s authority in the marriage because she desires to obey the Lord&rsquo;s will (not necessarily because her husband &ldquo;deserves&rdquo; her respect in all cases). Nevertheless, she does not forfeit her dignity nor her right to speak her mind, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, our pride and ego lie&nbsp;to us by telling&nbsp;us that submission to authority is contrary to our best interests. To quote Bob Dylan, we all have to serve someone. If in our pride we determine to disobey the Lord&rsquo;s command so we can serve ourself, then we will pay a price in eternity for our disobedience, and that price will far exceed anything we might gain for ourselves through our prideful rebellion to His word.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, the command for Woman to submit to her husband&rsquo;s authority is often portrayed as a punishment, but in fact God&rsquo;s commands were grace to Woman. Notice that Woman is the only actor in chapter 3 who doesn&rsquo;t suffer under a specific curse from the Lord. Satan is cursed personally and the ground is cursed because of Adam, but the Lord never uses the word &ldquo;curse\" in relationship to Woman.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you you feel led to abstain from marriage, then we recommend you follow your conscience on this matter. Not all believers are &nbsp;called to be married. Please see <a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\">1Corinthians 7</a> for Paul&#39;s view on singleness.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, for a more complete understanding of how the Lord responded to the Woman, please listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis teaching.&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

But what about the case of a woman who fails to tell her husband about sexual encounters that took place prior to their marriage? Can he divorce her after learning of her deception even though the two have already consummated their marriage?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In the specific situation you described, the husband and wife would still be duly married and therefore may not divorce.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>First, the woman in your example committed the sin of fornication before her marriage, not after the marriage. As our <a href=\"/bible-answers/can-a-believer-divorce-or-remarry\">article explained</a>, only sexual infidelity&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;marriage is grounds for divorce and even then only when the married couple has not yet consummated their marriage.</p>\n\n<p>If a couple&nbsp;marries but fails to consummate their marriage for some reason (<em>e.g</em>., a soldier who marries immediately before deploying for&nbsp;battle, etc.), then the couple must remain faithful to their vows. Should one member of the marriage engage in sexual infidelity during this time, that act may be biblical grounds for divorce because the couple had not yet consummated their marriage. In this situation, the Bible permits divorce because a &ldquo;one-flesh&rdquo; relationship had not&nbsp;yet been established (<em>see Matthew 5:32 &amp; 19:8</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, this situation almost never happens in modern society. In our modern society, a couple typically consummates the marriage within hours of the wedding ceremony. With so little time separating the two events, it is virtually impossible today for a Christian to invoke the exception Jesus described in Matthew 5 &amp; 19.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Once consummation takes place in any marriage,&nbsp;that marriage cannot be ended except by the death of a spouse&nbsp;(<em>see Matthew 19:6 and&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans</a> 7</em>). Even though a&nbsp;marriage is formed under false pretenses as in the case you described, nevertheless deception does not invalidate a marriage in the eyes of God according to scripture. Scripture never makes deception or even infidelity <em>prior to marriage</em> grounds for divorce</p>\n\n<p>For example, consider the experience of Jacob, who was deceived into marrying the wrong woman in <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis 29</a>! Though Jacob was deceived, nevertheless once he had consummated the marriage with Leah&nbsp;his marriage was valid and sealed for life. Jacob could not walk away from his commitment to Leah despite being deceived by Leah&#39;s father, Laban.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore&nbsp;in the situation you described,&nbsp;the woman&rsquo;s fornication prior to marriage was regrettable, but once her marriage was consummated, her prior sexual sin was no longer relevant&nbsp;to the validity of her marriage. The marriage has been formed and must be honored by both parties.</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: What are \"soul ties\" and is this a biblical teaching?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;The term &ldquo;soul ties&rdquo; was coined by false teachers to misrepresent the meaning of certain passages of scripture. The term soul ties never appears in scripture, and neither does the concept it describes. The term refers to supposed uniting or tying of one&nbsp;person&rsquo;s spirit&nbsp;to the spirit of another person in some way. The Bible never describes such a possibility nor teaches that it exists.</p>\n\n<p>False teachers point to passages like <a href=\"/bible-studies/1samuel\">1Samuel 18:1</a>, which says David&rsquo;s soul was &ldquo;knit&rdquo; to Jonathan&rsquo;s soul, or <a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\">1Corinthians 6:16</a>, which commands believers not to engage in sexual sin, to support their improper interpretation. They claim these passages are examples of knitting souls together, but their claim is not supported by a proper interpretation of the text. Rather, this is a classic case of false teaching distorting the true meaning of scripture to promulgate strange myths built upon speculation (see 1Tim 1:4).</p>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches that a believer&#39;s spirit is united with Christ alone and with no one else. Not even in marriage do we unite spiritually with another person. Marriage unites a husband and wife in flesh only until the death of the body according to Romans 7. Our spirit is Christ&rsquo;s alone.</p>\n\n<p>The passages quoted by those who falsely teach soul ties are speaking of different ideas altogether. For example, in the case of David and Jonathan, the author described their souls knitted together because these two entered into a covenant together. Covenants unite two people in a lifelong earthly bond, not a spiritual bond.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the case of David and Jonathan, Jonathan felt great affection and admiration for David, recognizing him to be the future king of Israel, and so he became devoted to David and entered into a covenant with David (i.e., his soul was &ldquo;knit&rdquo; to David).&nbsp;Obviously, this terminology doesn&rsquo;t mean that the two men were united in some mystical, spiritual sense. It simply describes their deep emotional and covenantal bond.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the case of 1Corinthians 6:16 Paul warns believers not to become &ldquo;one-flesh&rdquo; with prostitutes through an act of sexual immorality. Notice Paul&rsquo;s concern was that of becoming one flesh, not one soul. He was describing the life-long bond of marriage, not a special spiritual union.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, there is no biblical support for the concept of soul ties. It is an unbiblical teaching.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

This promise is sure because all the sin of a person&rsquo;s life &ndash; both the sin prior to salvation and the sin that is committed after salvation &ndash; was paid by Jesus&rsquo; blood on the cross.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<h5>Rom. 3:22&nbsp;even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 3:23&nbsp;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 3:24&nbsp;being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 3:25&nbsp;whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 3:26&nbsp;for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>All have sinned, but the Lord justified us (i.e., declared us to be without guilt for our sin) by our faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus took all the penalty that we deserved for our sin. Notice Paul says in v.25 that God passed over (i.e., forgave) the sins of our past because of Christ. Therefore, we have no fear of condemnation:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:1&nbsp;Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Th. 5:9&nbsp;For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</h5>\n\n<p>Furthermore, all who have placed their trust in Christ cannot be denied this salvation, since Jesus said that&nbsp;all those who come to Him would never be without Him:</p>\n\n<h5>John 6:37&nbsp;&ldquo;All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out.<br />\nJohn 6:38&nbsp;&ldquo;For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.<br />\nJohn 6:39&nbsp;&ldquo;This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day.</h5>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the scriptures teach that the Spirit Who indwells every believer is a permanent sealing until the day of redemption:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 1:13&nbsp;In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation &mdash; having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,&nbsp;<br />\nEph. 1:14&nbsp;who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God&rsquo;s own possession, to the praise of His glory.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Eph. 4:30&nbsp;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were&nbsp;sealed&nbsp;for the day of redemption.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Every believer is promised salvation, sealed by the Spirit and cannot be lost from Christ&rsquo;s grip. The power of the Spirit is not to be compared with the demon world or ever Satan. Satan is nothing but a created being, without compare to the power and authority of the Creator Himself. This is why John tells us not to fear the enemy:</p>\n\n<h5>1John 4:4&nbsp;You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, the demon world has no power to disrupt the promises of God to every believer. The Spirit holds us and assures us that we will be resurrected into eternal life. No curse spoken by mere men or demon can interrupt the plans of God as Paul said:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:31&nbsp; What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:32&nbsp;He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:33&nbsp;Who will bring a charge against God&rsquo;s elect?

I&#39;ve heard they are part of a quasi-Jewish movement&nbsp;in the church, and they seem to teach unbiblical views.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;The group you mentioned is part of a larger movement outside the church called the &ldquo;Sacred Name&rdquo; movement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sacred Name thinking teaches numerous theological errors; chief among them that by a verbal pronunciation of a certain version of Jesus&#39; name is the only true way to salvation and to accomplishing&nbsp;spiritual work. This movement twists an ancient Semitic cultural tradition of associating a person&rsquo;s name with their authority, power, and character into a false belief that we can appropriate Jesus&#39; power and authority merely by invoking His name in a certain, mystical way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This cult (and others like it) typically cite support for their views from the following verse:</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 2:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&rsquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The proper interpretation of this verse understands that to&nbsp;&ldquo;call on the name of the Lord&hellip;&rdquo; means to cry out to Jesus with a heart of repentance seeking His mercy and His free gift of salvation, but&nbsp;the sacred name cults distort this verse&nbsp;through a&nbsp;hyper-literal interpretation that claims a person need only state&nbsp;the name of the Savior or the Father to receive personal salvation. In other words, these groups believe that everyone who <strong><em>pronounces</em></strong> the name of the Lord will be saved.</p>\n\n<p>This heresy reduces the Gospel to a magic incantation. Even more bizarre, most sacred name groups teach that a person must pronounce the name&nbsp;in a certain, special way using an ancient language if they are to qualify for this salvation. These cults are&nbsp;a modern-day form of Gnosticism&nbsp;offering a \"secret knowledge\" necessary for salvation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Often, they teach strict adherence to certain laws within the Old Covenant and other man-made restrictions and observances. I<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">n the end, these movements are merely another form of works&nbsp;salvation, which is always a false gospel regardless of what form it takes. Anyone&nbsp;who has placed his or her hope for salvation in works (including pronouncing names or observing the Mosaic Law)&nbsp;are not saved. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Sacred Name groups share similarities with other false movements like&nbsp;Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses or Mormons, which can all be classified as cults that control members by strictly limiting members&#39; access to unapproved teaching materials outside the movement and by demanding compliance through intimidation and peer pressure.&nbsp;Once a person is captured in one of these movements, it can be very difficult to rescue them.&nbsp;A few individuals within these movements may be true believers having been led astray by false teaching, but we assume&nbsp;the vast majority are not born again.</span></p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about Sacred Name cults, you can find additional resources at <a href=\"http://www.sacredname.com\">another ministry</a> dedicated to debunking the sacred name movement.&nbsp;That website offers recommendations on books, articles, and resources to counter the errors of the Sacred Name movement.</p>"

First, the Bible teaches that the Lord only hears the prayers of His children. God&rsquo;s children are those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:14&nbsp;For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:15&nbsp;For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:16&nbsp;The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:17&nbsp;and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.</h5>\n\n<p>If you have placed your trust in Jesus Christ for salvation, believing Him to be the Son of God and Savior, then you can be sure your prayers are heard by the Lord. If you have yet to confess faith in Jesus Christ, we invite you to read the <a href=\"/about/how_can_i_go_to_heaven\">following article</a> on knowing Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Bible also teaches that Lord will only give His children what is best, and if we are asking for the wrong things, then we can expect He will not grant our requests, as James teaches:</p>\n\n<h5>James 4:2&nbsp;You lust and do not have; so you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 4:3&nbsp;You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>If you are making certain requests to the Lord and have not received what you have requested, perhaps the Lord is waiting for you to alter your request to align with His will?&nbsp;<br />\nTo better understand how the Lord works through prayer, we recommend you listen to Lesson 2 in the <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_sovereignty_of_god\">Sovereignty of God </a>series.</p>"

Though most of the events of that chapter are presented chronologically, we can also see&nbsp;based on the overall structure of chapter 1 that Moses&#39; narrative is building to the climactic moment when Man (i.e., man and woman) are created.

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Can you explain the Bible&#39;s teaching on eternal rewards?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A: The Bible makes clear that God gives eternal rewards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When talking about rewards based on our works, it&rsquo;s critical that we first understand that our salvation is by faith alone in Christ alone; we are saved, justified, redeemed, solely by faith in Jesus and not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). &nbsp;Titus 3 says:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;4 But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, 5 He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, 6 whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, having saved us, God does expect us to perform good works (Ephesians 2:10).&nbsp; It is for such works that the believer in Jesus Christ will be rewarded. In fact, God encourages us to work for such rewards.&nbsp; In Matthew 6, our Lord Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;19 &ldquo;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; 21 for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, not only is it Biblical for Christians to do good works with an eye toward heavenly rewards, it is God&rsquo;s will for us to do so.</p>\n\n<h3>Rewards Are Based On Our Works</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"/bible-answers/does_james_tech_that_works_are_required_for_salvation\">While salvation is by faith alone in Christ alone</a>, it pleases God to give believers rewards based on our works.&nbsp;There are plenty of Scriptures that demonstrate this. For example, God desires that we do good works; it was part of His purpose in saving us.</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.&rdquo; (Ephesians 2)&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;18 Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, 19 storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.&rdquo; (1 Timothy 6)</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;11 &ldquo;Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.&rdquo; (Matthew 5)&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Even persecution for our faith in Jesus brings us heavenly rewards.</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;1 Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.&nbsp; 2 &ldquo;So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. 3 But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.&rdquo; (Matthew 6)&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Note that our good works should only be done for the glory of God, not to be recognized by men, even if it means doing good works in secret.&nbsp; In that way, our reward is in heaven, not on earth.</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;42 And whoever in the name of a disciple gives to one of these little ones even a cup of cold water to drink, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.&rdquo; (Matthew 10)</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;35 But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men.&rdquo; (Luke 6)</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;8 Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 3)&nbsp; What we do with our lives in service to God determines our rewards.</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;23 Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men, 24 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.&rdquo; (Colossians 3)</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;6 And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.&rdquo; (Hebrews 11)<br />\n&ldquo;7 With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, 8 knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.&rdquo; (Ephesians 6)</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;12 Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done.&rdquo; (Revelation 22)&nbsp; The Lord will reward us based on our works, what we have done.</h5>\n\n<p>More Scriptures could be given, but it&rsquo;s clear from the above that we earn eternal rewards based on our works here on earth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>God Will Judge Our Works</h3>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re all familiar with the concept of rewards based on our efforts.&nbsp;Most employers will reward their employees based on a judgment of how well the workers have done their jobs.&nbsp;Similarly, in competitive games (such as the Olympics), athletes are judged by their performance.&nbsp;Likewise, scripture makes clear that God will judge our works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Again, this judgment has nothing to do with our salvation; which comes in one moment when the Lord gave us faith to believe in His Son.&nbsp;The judgment that assigns rewards is only for the believer &nbsp;Furthermore, as we&rsquo;ll show below, there is no punishment related to this judgment.</p>\n\n<p>There are three key passages relating to God&rsquo;s judging our works.</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;9 Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him. 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.&rdquo; (2 Corinthians 5)</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;10 But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. 11 For it is written, &ldquo;As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, And every tongue shall give praise to God.&rdquo;&nbsp; 12 So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God.&rdquo; (Romans 14)</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;10 According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it. 11 For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12 Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 13 each man&rsquo;s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man&rsquo;s work. 14 If any man&rsquo;s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward. 15 If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 3)</h5>\n\n<p>The first thing to consider is judgment.&nbsp;Note that both 2 Corinthians 5 and Romans 14 mention that Christians will stand before the judgment seat of Christ.&nbsp;The Greek for this is the <em>bema</em> seat (pronounced bay-ma), and appears seven times in Scripture.&nbsp;The <em>bema</em>, or judgment, seat was a raised platform on which an official would sit, usually in a role of handing out judgment of some kind.=</p>\n\n<p>At times, penalties and/or punishment were handed down from the official on the judgment seat.&nbsp; For example, in Matthew 27:19 and John 19:13, we see Pontius Pilate sitting on the judgment seat.&nbsp; Also, in Acts 18:12;16-18, we see the Jews bringing Paul to the Roman proconsul Gallio for judgment.&nbsp; Clearly, in these passages, the judgment seat represents an official in a role designed to declare a person guilty or innocent, and if guilty, then punishment would also be handed down.</p>\n\n<p>So, if the judgment seat meant a judgment for declaring a person innocent or guilty, and came with potential punishment, how do we know that this is not what is meant in Romans 14 and 2 Corinthians 5?</p>\n\n<p>First and foremost, Scripture makes clear that Christians will not be judged for our sin.&nbsp; Again, Christ paid for all of our sins, past, present and future.&nbsp; As a reminder, a few Scriptures make this plain:</p>\n\n<h5>John 3:18 &ndash; &nbsp;&ldquo;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, judgment clearly refers to eternal salvation, as Scripture makes clear that we who believe in Christ will not be judged.</h5>\n\n<h5>Romans 8:1 &ndash; &ldquo;Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the judgment seat meant possible punishment, then this verse makes no sense.</h5>\n\n<h5>Hebrews 10:11-12;17-18 &ndash; &ldquo;11 Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; 12 but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God&hellip;17 &ldquo;And their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Jesus&rsquo; sacrifice for our sins was offered once, for all time.&nbsp; Also, God says once He has saved us, that He will remember our sins no more; He has forgiven us.&nbsp; Therefore, it logically follows that there cannot be any punishment for the Christian.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, &ldquo;judgment seat&rdquo; in both Romans 14 and 2 Corinthians 5 cannot mean a judgment that involves any determination of innocence or guilt, along with any punishment.&nbsp; So, what does the Lord mean by His &ldquo;judgment seat&rdquo; in these passages?</p>\n\n<p>Here, judgment seat is analogous to the judgment given at Olympic games.&nbsp; As one writer puts it, &ldquo;This word [bema] was taken from Isthmian games where the contestants would compete for the prize under the scrutiny of judges who would make sure that every rule of the contest was obeyed. &nbsp;The victor of a given event who participated according to the rules was led by the judge to the platform called the Bema. &nbsp;There the laurel wreath was placed on his head as a symbol of victory.&rdquo;&nbsp; How can we make such an interpretation when Scripture does not use the word &ldquo;bema&rdquo; explicitly in this way?</p>\n\n<p>The victor of a given event who participated according to the rules was led by the judge to the platform called the Bema. &nbsp;There the laurel wreath was placed on his head as a symbol of victory.&rdquo;&nbsp; How can we make such an interpretation when Scripture does not use the word &ldquo;bema&rdquo; explicitly in this way?</p>\n\n<p>Well, there are specific Scriptures that do refer to Olympic type games, especially as an analogy to the life of the believer:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;3 Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 4 No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier. 5 Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules. 6 The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.&rdquo; (2 Timothy 2)&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Here, we see the believer as a soldier, athlete, and farmer.&nbsp; Notice we seek to please someone as a soldier (just as we seek to please God), we &ldquo;win a prize&rdquo; as we compete in the games, and we should expect our &ldquo;share of the crops.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only does this refer to Olympic type games, but both the athlete and the farmer should expect something for their work.</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;24 Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win. 25 Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. 26 Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; 27 but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 9)&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Again, Paul uses the language of &ldquo;running a race to receive the prize&rdquo;. Those who ran such races did so to receive a wreath, which was their prize. &nbsp;Just as an athlete disciplines himself so that he is not distracted in his training to win the race, so should a believer discipline himself as he serves the Lord, not being distracted by the things of this life, all with an expectation of receiving a reward.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, the prize or reward here is not referring to salvation.&nbsp; Likewise, when Paul says he does not want to be disqualified, he is not talking about losing his salvation.&nbsp; How do we know?&nbsp; Very simply, because our salvation is not based on what we did or do.&nbsp; God has chosen us for salvation from before the foundation of the earth (Ephesians 1).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our salvation was accomplished by Christ&rsquo;s life, death, and resurrection:&nbsp; our sins were forgiven in Christ by His death on the cross, and we are counted righteous by His sinless life, all by faith (Romans 4 and 5).&nbsp; Finally, our perseverance in the faith is protected by God, not by us (1 Peter 1).</p>\n\n<p>Rather, disqualified here refers to not being able to receive rewards.&nbsp; Think about what happens to an athlete in the Olympic games.&nbsp; If he is disqualified, is he punished?&nbsp; No, but he cannot compete in the games and, therefore, cannot win the prize.&nbsp; So it is with the believer who does not live (run) in such a way as to receive rewards (the prize).</p>\n\n<p>Given all of the above, then, we see that when the Bible speaks of God judging our works, it is a judgment (bema) similar to that of an athlete participating in Olympic type games.&nbsp; It is a judgment with a purpose of handing out rewards (or not) but has nothing to do with our salvation.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>God&rsquo;s Basis For Our Rewards</h3>\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, our rewards are conditional.&nbsp; More specifically, rewards will be based upon whether we did our works in the power of our flesh or in the power of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; The key passage here is 1 Corinthians 3:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;10 According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it. 11 For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 12 Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 13 each man&rsquo;s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man&rsquo;s work. 14 If any man&rsquo;s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward. 15 If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>The passage begins with the gospel (the foundation which is Jesus Christ).&nbsp;There is no other foundation on which anyone can build.&nbsp;That is, what follows can only apply to believers, those who are in Jesus Christ by faith alone.</p>\n\n<p>Paul then talks about &ldquo;building&rdquo; on this foundation.&nbsp;The act of building&nbsp;is similar to the running of a race. Both represent the works we do in our life that will be judged by Christ at the <em>Bema</em>, the judgment seat of God.</p>\n\n<p>The picture of our works here is compared to a building and the type of materials used for the building.&nbsp; Because our works will be tested by fire, the quality of the material used will determine which works will survive the testing and which ones will not.</p>\n\n<p>The &ldquo;testing&rdquo; here refers to Christ judging our works.&nbsp;The word &ldquo;test&rsquo; is <em>dokimazo</em>, which means &ldquo;to test, examine, prove, scrutinize, (to see whether a thing is genuine or not), as metals; to recognize as genuine after examination, to approve, deem worthy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Through the process of this testing, the quality of our works will be revealed.&nbsp; So the idea here is that Jesus will judge our works in a way that determines which works are genuinely done in the power of the Spirit &ndash; those made of gold, silver and precious stones, those that are worthy of rewards.&nbsp; The Lord will also test those works that were done in the power of the flesh &ndash; works of hay, wood, and straw, works that will be deemed unworthy.</p>\n\n<p>This passage is in agreement with the previously mentioned passage in 2 Corinthians 5:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The word &ldquo;recompensed&rdquo; means &ldquo;to receive, to carry off&rdquo;.&nbsp;It has the idea of carrying off booty, to receive back what is one&rsquo;s own.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if our work survives the Lord&rsquo;s testing, we will receive a reward.&nbsp;In a very real sense, these rewards are available to us only because of the Lord&rsquo;s working in us (Philippians 2:13).&nbsp; Scripture sometimes refers to our rewards as &ldquo;crowns&rdquo; (e.g., Philippians 4:1, 1 Thessalonians 2:19), and we will cast our crowns at the feet of Christ (Revelation 4:10-11), as only God is truly worthy.&nbsp; So, the Lord will honor our work here on earth done in the power of the Spirit with heavenly rewards, and we will return that honor to Him in heaven.&nbsp; Indeed, the early church father Augustine put it this way:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;It is His own gifts that God crowns, not your virtues. If your virtues come from your own self, not from God, then they are evil, and God does not crown them. But if they are good, they are God&rsquo;s gifts, because, as the Apostle James says, &lsquo;Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights&rsquo; (James1:17). In accordance with this John the Lord&rsquo;s forerunner also declares: &lsquo;A man can receive nothing unless it is given to him from heaven&rsquo; (John 3:27) &mdash; from heaven, of course, because from there came also the Holy Spirit, when Jesus ascended up on high, led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men. If, then, your good virtues are God&rsquo;s gifts, God does not crown them as your virtues, but as His own gifts.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>What if our rewards do not survive the Lord&rsquo;s judgment, they are &ldquo;burned up&rdquo; in the testing fire?&nbsp; As 1 Corinthians 3 says, we will &ldquo;suffer loss&rdquo;.&nbsp;The loss comes from not receiving rewards that could have otherwise been received.&nbsp; Again, as shown earlier, this has nothing to do with salvation.&nbsp; In fact, the passage makes this clear in that it explicitly states that such a person will be saved.</p>\n\n<p>What about what Paul says of our works in 2 Corinthians 5:10, when he refers to our &ldquo;bad&rdquo; works?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t we be rewarded for &ldquo;good&rdquo; works and punished for &ldquo;bad&rdquo; works?&nbsp; The original Greek word for &ldquo;bad&rdquo; here is <em>phaulos</em>.&nbsp;This word for &ldquo;bad&rdquo; refers to something that is worthless or valueless.&nbsp;So, the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; simply means works we&rsquo;ve done in the flesh and will have no value, and so will not be rewarded.</p>\n\n<p>One writer provided a great analogy of our rewards and lack thereof:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;The judgment seat of Christ might be compared to a commencement ceremony. &nbsp;At graduation there is some measure of disappointment and remorse that one did not do better and work harder. &nbsp;However, at such an event the overwhelming emotion is joy, not remorse. &nbsp;The graduates do not leave the auditorium weeping because they did not earn better grades. &nbsp;Rather, they are thankful that they have been graduated, and they are grateful for what they did achieve. &nbsp;To overdo the sorrow aspect of the judgment seat of Christ is to make heaven hell. &nbsp;To underdo the sorrow aspect is to make faithfulness inconsequential.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h3>Catagories of Rewards</h3>\n\n<p>Scripture uses the symbol of a \"crown\" to describe the catagories of rewards. To understand this symbol, we must first understand how the Bible uses the word&nbsp;crown. &nbsp;In Scripture, there are two types of crowns.&nbsp;In the original Greek language of the New Testament, one type of crown is called a <em>diadem</em>, which is a royal crown, that which belongs to a king. It is the crown Jesus wears as King of Kings and Lord of Lords (e.g., Revelation 19:12). This type of crown can&#39;t be earned, since it belongs to someone as a matter of birthright.</p>\n\n<p>The second Greek word for crown is&nbsp;<em>stephanos</em>, which describes the wreath given to a victor in Olympic games. This type of crown is earned for good performance.</p>\n\n<p>When the Bible uses the term crown to describe a believer&#39;s reward, the Bible always uses the Greek word stephanos, indicating a result of a good performance. There are five types of stephanos promised to believers for obedience to Christ while on earth.</p>\n\n<h4>Crown of Victory</h4>\n\n<p>1Corinthians 9:24-27 describes this crown:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;24 Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win. 25 Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. 26 Therefore, I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; 27 but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>This reward will be given to all believers who run the race to win, who discipline the flesh to make it their slave so they will be able to serve the Lord.&nbsp;Again, note that we can only achieve this by the power of the Holy Spirit, so the reward is ultimately accomplished in God&rsquo;s power, not ours.</p>\n\n<h4>The Crown of Rejoicing</h4>\n\n<p>This crown is described in 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20 and Philippians 4:1:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;19 For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? 20 For you are our glory and joy.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;1 Therefore, my beloved brethren whom I long to see, my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>This reward will go to those who have witnessed to others and who have built up the church (e.g., by teaching, service, etc.).</p>\n\n<h4>The Crown of Life &nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>This crown is mentioned in James 1:12 and Revelation 2:10:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;12 Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;10 Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, so that you will be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>At first glance, it may appear that the &ldquo;crown of life&rdquo; refers to eternal life. That cannot be the case, however, as that would contradict many other Scriptures that clearly state that eternal life comes by faith alone in Christ alone, and which is given as a gift and not by works (e.g., Ephesians 2:8-9). Remember, a staphos is a reward for performance, and salvation is never granted for good performance.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, this crown is given to those who faithfully persevere through trials.&nbsp;Once again, we can only persevere such trials and tribulations by God&rsquo;s power in us (1 Peter 1:5-7).</p>\n\n<h4>The Crown of Righteousness</h4>\n\n<p>We find this in 2 Timothy 4:8:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;8 in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Again, righteousness here does not refer to righteousness we achieve by works, as Scripture makes clear that our righteousness is found only in the imputed righteousness of Christ (e.g., Romans 5:19).&nbsp; Rather, this reward is given to those who eagerly await the appearing of the Lord.&nbsp; As believers, we should always be expectantly looking for the return of our Lord.&nbsp; John Calvin put it this way:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is a singular mark which he employs in describing believers. And, indeed, wherever faith is strong, it will not permit their minds to fall asleep in this world, but will elevate them to the hope of the last resurrection. His meaning therefore is, that all who are so much devoted to the world, and who love so much this fleeting life, as not to care about the coming of Christ, and not to be moved by any desire of it, deprive themselves of immortal glory. Woe to our stupidity, therefore, which exercises such power over us, that we never think seriously about the coming of Christ, to which we ought to give our whole attention.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h4>The Crown of Glory</h4>\n\n<p>This reward is described in 1 Peter 5:1-4:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;1 Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, 2 shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; 3 nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock. 4 And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>This is a reward for the elders the Lord has placed in authority in His church.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an exhortation as well as an incentive for the elders to rule as the Lord has directed.</p>\n\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h3>When Will We Receive Our Rewards?</h3>\n\n<p>Our rewards will be awarded at the Judgment Seat of Christ, which will occur after the removal of the Church (i.e., the Rapture) according to 1Thessalonians 4:13-18. &nbsp;Jesus says in Luke 14:14, &ldquo;you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous&rdquo;, and Paul says in 1Corinthians 15 that the resurrection happens at the rapture. &nbsp;Furthermore, Jesus says in Revelation 22:12, &ldquo;Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done,\" speaking of His return for the Church.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when the Lord comes to meet us in the air at the rapture, He will have our reward with Him. Initially, our rewards will be in the form of a crown as described above, but this is merely a token of the true reward we will enjoy in the Kingdom. Our true reward comes in the form of an inheritance in the Kingdom and a place of authority in Christ&#39;s government. Jesus explained these two types of rewards in the <a href=\"/bible-answers/explaining-talents-vs.-minas\">parables of the minas and talents</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the <a href=\"/bible-answers/how_do_we_know_there_will_be_a_rapture\">Church will be removed from the earth prior to the start of the Kingdom</a>, the Lord assigns us a crown as a temporary token of our true reward while we await the start of the Kingdom. Our crown (one of those mentioned above) will serve as our reward until we enter the Kingdom with Christ. During the short time we spend in the Throne Room awaiting the start of the Kingdom, the Bible says we cast our crowns at the throne to honor Christ Who made possible the Kingdom and our part in it:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 4:9 &nbsp;And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,<br />\nRev. 4:10 &nbsp;the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,<br />\nRev. 4:11 &nbsp;&ldquo;Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Once we enter the Kingdom following Tribulation, we receive our true reward in two ways. First, we receive a portion of Christ&#39;s inheritance in the Kingdom, which means some portion of the physical earth will be assigned to us&nbsp;to enjoy, as these scriptures explain:</p>\n\n<h5>Col. 3:23 Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men,<br />\nCol. 3:24 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.</h5>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 1:3 &nbsp;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,<br />\n1Pet. 1:4 to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,<br />\n1Pet. 1:5 who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</h5>\n\n<p>Secondly, our reward includes a position of responsibility ruling with Christ in His Kingdom government. Several Scriptures mention this (e.g., Luke 19:17-19, Luke 19:17, Revelation 2). Matthew 25:19-21 offers a classic summary of this type of reward:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;19 Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.&nbsp; 20 The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, &lsquo;Master, you entrusted five talents to me. See, I have gained five more talents.&rsquo;&nbsp; 21 His master said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.&rsquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>We are merely Christ&rsquo;s slaves, meaning we are to do the will of our Master.&nbsp; We can only do His will in the power of the Spirit.&nbsp; In doing so, God promises He will reward our obedience of being faithful here by giving us even greater responsibilities when we rule with Christ.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen from all the above, Scripture makes clear that God rewards us for our works.&nbsp; That He does provide us with the potential for rewards speaks to God&rsquo;s incredible graciousness.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more than enough for us to be obedient to Him for what He did on the cross, saving us from His wrath that we deserved, and giving us Christ&rsquo;s righteousness; yet God does even more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>He promises us heavenly rewards for our obedience though we do not deserve rewards any more than we deserved our salvation.&nbsp; Just as our salvation was not accomplished in our own power, we earn rewards by our works, but only by works done in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, we do have a role to play.&nbsp; We must walk in the Spirit and not in the flesh if we desire such rewards.&nbsp; This is accomplished by reading, studying, and meditating on God&rsquo;s word, and praying that He will work in us to do His will.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also by keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the author, and perfecter of our faith; by setting our minds on things above, where Christ is. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By not doing these things, we give room for the flesh and the devil, and thereby grieve the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Therefore, rewards are an encouragement for us to be diligent to be in His will.&nbsp; We seek to be pleasing to the Lord, and we are most pleasing to Him when we are doing His will.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As Jesus said, &ldquo;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.&rdquo; (John 14:15).&nbsp; May the Lord work in us to will and to do for His good pleasure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;20 Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, 21 to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; (Ephesians 3)</h5>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: My spouse and I divorced, but we never remarried. Now I am seeking reconciliation, but my spouse is not interested. Am I free to marry another since I am willing to reconcile to my ex-spouse but am unable?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;Before we answer your question, you may find the <a href=\"/bible-answers/can-a-believer-divorce-or-remarry\">following article </a>helpful background to understanding this issue from a Biblical perspective.</p>\n\n<p>As we explained in that article, both individuals in marriage are required to honor their marriage vows until the covenant is ended by the death of one, as Paul explains:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 7:2&nbsp;For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:3&nbsp;So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>This is in keeping with the &ldquo;one-flesh&rdquo; principle we explained in the article above. Each person is individually required to honor his or her marriage vow, and this requirement does not depend on the fidelity of the spouse or on his or her willingness to reconcile after a divorce. Remember, what God has brought together, no man (person) may separate. &ldquo;No man&rdquo; includes both members of the marriage itself. We may pursue a legal divorce, but that is merely a man-made accommodation. God does not release us from our marriage vows even though a court may.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we are required to honor our marriage vows even if (or when) our spouse does not and regardless of whether that person desires reconciliation. A Christian&#39;s faithfulness to his or her marriage vows in the face of a broken marriage is a service we do for God to please Him. Though we may regret the loss of an opportunity to enjoy marriage in this life, nevertheless&nbsp;our faithfulness will receive an eternal reward. Only after&nbsp;we have received our inheritance in the kingdom can we appreciate how important our obedience and faithfulness is to God, and scripture says we will not regret our choice to be faithful and obedient to the Lord.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As Paul said:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:18&nbsp;For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 2:9&nbsp;&nbsp;but just as it is written,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And which have not entered the heart of man,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All that God has prepared for those who love Him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>As Paul implies, we should live with \"eyes for eternity,&rdquo; as Pastor Armstrong teaches, knowing that the fruit of our obedience won&rsquo;t be known to us until we leave this body and enter the next.&nbsp;Therefore, we encourage you to hold fast to your marriage vows as an act of obedience and service to God trusting He will reward that faithfulness, both in this life and in the next. As Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>Mark 10:29&nbsp;Jesus said, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or farms, for My sake and for the gospel&rsquo;s sake,<br />\nMark 10:30&nbsp;but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and farms, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.</h5>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Are there examples in scripture of God answering the prayers of unbelievers?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;There are no examples in scripture we know of&nbsp;unbelieving men or women praying to God and being heard. On the other hand, we do find examples of unbelievers who interact with God (in some form) like Cain, who knew of God but who lacked faith in God&rsquo;s promises. These interactions are merely evidence of James&rsquo; comments regarding the acknowledgment of God absent faith:</p>\n\n<h5>James 2:19&nbsp;You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Bible states plainly that the &ldquo;prayers&rdquo; (i.e., petitions) of the unbelieving worlds are not heard by God, because unless we approach the throne of God by way of Jesus, we have no access to the Father:</p>\n\n<h5>Prov. 15:29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Lord is far from the wicked,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But He hears the prayer of the righteous.&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 34:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And His ears are open to their cry.&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 34:16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The face of the Lord is against evildoers,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To cut off the memory of them from the earth.&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 34:17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The righteous cry, and the Lord hears&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And delivers them out of all their troubles.&nbsp;<br />\nProv. 15:8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But the prayer of the upright is His delight.&nbsp;<br />\nPsa. 138:6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For though the Lord is exalted,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yet He regards the lowly,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But the haughty He knows from afar.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>John 14:6&nbsp; Jesus&nbsp;said to him, &ldquo;I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.</h5>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 2:5&nbsp;For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>These scriptures and others testify that no one may pray to (or approach) the Father except in the name of Jesus. Therefore, those who do not know Christ cannot be heard since they do not approach the Father through the Son. This is&nbsp;the plain teaching of the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the Bible says that men and women are born enemies of God because of the sin they inherit from Adam, but by faith in Christ we are adopted as children of God:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 1:5&nbsp;He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:14&nbsp;For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:15&nbsp;For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:16&nbsp;The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:17&nbsp;and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.</h5>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Reading through the Law of Israel, I see commands to \"love thy God\" and statements that God loves Israel, but then so much more of the Law speaks of fearing the Lord your God. Was Israel&#39;s relationship with God based on fear or love?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;A relationship with the living God has always been based on faith in the promises of God. God makes promises because of His love for the world and His willingness to extend His mercy, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 9:16&nbsp;So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Our relationship with the Lord is based in His love, and while it will also provoke in us love and appreciation for what He has done for us, we are called by scripture to fear the Lord:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:22&nbsp;let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:23&nbsp;Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:24&nbsp;and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:25&nbsp;not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:26&nbsp; For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:27&nbsp;but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire which will consume the adversaries.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:28&nbsp;Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:29&nbsp;How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:30&nbsp;For we know Him who said, &ldquo;Vengeance is mine, I will repay.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;The Lord will judge His people.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 10:31&nbsp;It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</h5>\n\n<p>The fear of the Lord is a biblical principle for all God&rsquo;s children, whether in the Old Testament times or today. Whenever we see a person enter into the presence of the glory of God in the Bible, that person always exhibits fear. Even the apostle John had this experience with the risen, glorified Jesus appeared to Him:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 1:12&nbsp; Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands;&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 1:13&nbsp;and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a golden sash.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 1:14&nbsp;His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 1:15&nbsp;His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 1:16&nbsp;In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 1:17&nbsp; When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last,<br />\nRev. 1:18&nbsp;and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.</h5>\n\n<p>Notice John&rsquo;s reaction was one of fear.&nbsp;This is not something of the past. This is and always will be the response of the creation in the presence of the awesome power of the Creator.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Fear is not contradictory to love. The two go hand in hand, Just as we both loved yet at times&nbsp;feared our earthly fathers, so it is with God. Fear and respect of God should be our attitude as well since it reflects an understanding that we will stand for judgment before the Lord after our death. As the writer of Hebrews emphasizes, we will all be judged by God. In the case of believers, our judgment is for the assignment of rewards, but nevertheless, we must live our lives with a healthy fear of God if we are to be properly motivated to serve Him well.</p>\n\n<p>For a more detailed explanation of the fear of God, please listen to Lesson 11-12 of our <a href=\"/bible-studies/1samuel\">1Samuel study</a>.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: You teach that the Canaanites were cursed </strong></em><em><strong>and therefore</strong></em><em><strong> the Lord intended to wipe out the entire lineage. Since Rahab was a Canaanite, how did the Lord allow her to be a part of Christ&#39;s line?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;The curse against the Canaanites fell upon the people who descended from Canaan, as Noah declared:</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 9:25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So he said,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Cursed be Canaan;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A servant of servants&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He shall be to his brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nGen. 9:26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He also said,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Blessed be the Lord,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The God of Shem;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And let Canaan be his servant.&nbsp;<br />\nGen. 9:27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;May God enlarge Japheth,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And let him dwell in the tents of Shem;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And let Canaan be his servant.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The curse fell upon the son of Ham, Canaan, and all the people who descended from Canaan. The purpose of the curse was to open the land for Israel&rsquo;s eventual occupation, as God promised to Abraham:</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 15:12&nbsp; Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him.&nbsp;<br />\nGen. 15:13&nbsp;God said to Abram, &ldquo;Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years.&nbsp;<br />\nGen. 15:14&nbsp;&ldquo;But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions.&nbsp;<br />\nGen. 15:15&nbsp;&ldquo;As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age.&nbsp;<br />\nGen. 15:16&nbsp;&ldquo;Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In v.16 the name &ldquo;Amorite&rdquo; is a synonym for the Canaanite people in general. God declares that the timing for Abraham&rsquo;s descendants to enter the land was tied to the curse upon Canaan (i.e., the Amorites). Therefore, we know the curse served a good purpose in God&#39;s plan by giving just cause for assigning the land to Israel. Nevertheless, for 400 years after the promise was spoken to Abraham, the Canaanites were permitted to occupy the land so that the land might be prepared for Israel&rsquo;s arrival one day. In a sense, the Lord made the Canaanites caretakers for Israel&rsquo;s eventual takeover.</p>\n\n<p>Once Israel entered the land, the people of God were supposed to remove the Canaanites entirely in keeping with God&#39;s curse, Instead, the Jewish people tired of war and conceded territory to the Canaanites. After that, Israel had many occasions to interact with these doomed caretakers. God&nbsp;expressly prohibited His people from intermarriage with the Canaanites due to their harmful influence and the curse:</p>\n\n<h5>Deut. 7:1&nbsp; &ldquo;When the Lord your God brings you into the land where you are entering to possess it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and stronger than you,&nbsp;<br />\nDeut. 7:2&nbsp;and when the Lord your God delivers them before you and you defeat them, then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them and show no favor to them.&nbsp;<br />\nDeut. 7:3&nbsp;&ldquo;Furthermore, you shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor shall you take their daughters for your sons.&nbsp;<br />\nDeut. 7:4&nbsp;&ldquo;For they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods; then the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you and He will quickly destroy you.&nbsp;<br />\nDeut. 7:5&nbsp;&ldquo;But thus you shall do to them: you shall tear down their altars, and smash their sacred pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire.&nbsp;<br />\nDeut. 7:6&nbsp;&ldquo;For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The Lord was concerned for Israel&rsquo;s identity. His nation could not mix with the cursed Canaanite peoples lest they lose their identity and turn away from the Living God. Regrettably, Israel disobeyed this command many times over the centuries, yet the Lord remained faithful. At times, He took steps to ensure the people were protected from their own sin, including disciplining the nation harshly when they strayed into idolatry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When Judah strayed and married a Canaanite bride, Shua, their sons were barred from carrying the seed promise&nbsp;of God because they were under the Canaanite curse. Therefore, the Lord put them to death and brought forth children through Judah and his Jewish daughter-in-law, Tamar. On the other hand, God permitted Salmon to marry Rahab, a Canaanite woman, and produce children in the line of Christ. So what&rsquo;s the difference between Rahab and Shua?</p>\n\n<p>In a word, faith. While the sons of Shua are clearly shown to be evil unbelieving men in Genesis 38, the Bible says Rahab was a woman of faith (Heb 11:31). By faith, God redeems those under the curse, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>Gal. 3:11&nbsp;Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, &ldquo;the righteous man shall live by faith.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 3:12&nbsp;However, the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, &ldquo;He who practices them shall live by them.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 3:13&nbsp;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us &mdash; for it is written, &ldquo;Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 3:14&nbsp;in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Christ took our curse when He was killed on a &ldquo;tree&rdquo; as Paul says. So by her faith in Messiah, Rahab was redeemed from the curse of the Canaanites and the curse of sin. Such redemption was rare in the history of Israel, since apart from the few who knew&nbsp;faith, the Canaanite people were devoted to destruction so that God&rsquo;s people might receive their inheritance in the land.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q:&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>In Romans 8:29-30 Paul says that all who are chosen (i.e., predestined) will also be called (and later justified). But i</strong></em><em><strong>n Matthew 22:14, Jesus says not all who are called are chosen. Is this a contradiction? Are all the called also chosen or not?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;In Matthew 22 we read:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 22:1&nbsp; Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 22:2&nbsp;&ldquo;The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.<br />\nMatt. 22:3&nbsp;&ldquo;And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come.<br />\nMatt. 22:4&nbsp;&ldquo;Again he sent out other slaves saying, &lsquo;Tell those who have been invited, &ldquo;Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast.&rdquo;&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 22:5&nbsp;&ldquo;But they paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business,<br />\nMatt. 22:6&nbsp;and the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them.<br />\nMatt. 22:7&nbsp;&ldquo;But the king was enraged, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire.<br />\nMatt. 22:8&nbsp;&ldquo;Then he&nbsp; said to his slaves, &lsquo;The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.<br />\nMatt. 22:9&nbsp;&lsquo;Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find there, invite to the wedding feast.&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 22:10&nbsp;&ldquo;Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests.<br />\nMatt. 22:11&nbsp; &ldquo;But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes,<br />\nMatt. 22:12&nbsp;and he&nbsp; said to him, &lsquo;Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?&rsquo; And the man was speechless.<br />\nMatt. 22:13&nbsp;&ldquo;Then the king said to the servants, &lsquo;Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 22:14&nbsp;&ldquo;For many are called, but few are chosen.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice the statement in v.14 comes at the end of a parable. In fact, v.14 is Jesus&rsquo; conclusion from the parable concerning who will join the Lord at the banquet table in the Kingdom. The parable teaches that the Jewish nation (i.e., the slaves) were the primary guests for the Kingdom banquet. The Jewish Messiah (Jesus) came to Israel and declared that the Kingdom had arrived for them, but they rejected Jesus, and in the process, they rejected the Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the Lord turned to inviting other guests outside the city of Jerusalem (i.e., the Gentiles). These came into the Kingdom in place of the generation of Israel who rejected the Messiah. Notice the call to join the dinner feast went everywhere. The invitation was open to all and was declared opening, yet not all accepted the invitation properly. Some attempted to join the banquet without first participating in the wedding itself. They desired to share in the banquet but they were not willing to accept the invitation to the wedding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jesus applied the meaning of the parable when He said that many are called, but few are chosen. That is many hear the call of the Gospel in its proclamation. In the parable, the Master&rsquo;s slaves shouted the invitation high and low around the countryside. No doubt many heard the call as it passed by. Nevertheless, few were chosen to participate in the wedding and thereby qualify to attend the banquet, since the Master determines who is included in the wedding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This teaching is entirely consistent with Paul&rsquo;s teaching in Romans. Paul says in Romans 8:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:29&nbsp;For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:30&nbsp;and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul&rsquo;s teaching is centered on the one who is brought into salvation. That person is both called and chosen. Paul&rsquo;s teaching doesn&rsquo;t attempt to address the situation of the one who hears the call yet is unresponsive. Paul addresses that situation in another letter:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 4:3&nbsp;And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 4:4&nbsp;in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So in Romans Paul is speaking exclusively to the believer concerning the security we possess in Christ. All believers are (by definition) foreknown, predestined, called, justified and glorified. This is an unbroken chain that cannot be broken. Thus our salvation is secure in Christ. To the general world, however, a call goes out to believe but only the chosen respond to it.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

She asked me while we were dating if I had ever had&nbsp;previous sexual relationships, and I told her no. Listening to your teaching has convicted me to \"come clean,\" but&nbsp;wouldn&#39;t it be unnecessarily hurtful to confess my lie to my wife after so many years?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;Our ministry does not offer personal counseling services, but we can address the biblical issues you raised in your letter. We suspect you already know in your heart the answer we will offer, but sometimes it helps to hear confirmation from others.</p>\n\n<p>Deceit is the sin of concealing the truth by word or action, and in this situation, you are deceiving your wife by withholding the truth of your past. Moreover, you also committed the sin of lying by telling her a falsehood in response to her question before marriage.&nbsp;Neither act is loving toward your wife. On the contrary, when we deceive or lie to our own advantage, we love ourselves more than loving another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Bible instructs Christians to set aside all deceit:</p>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 2:1&nbsp; Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,&nbsp;<br />\n1Pet. 2:2&nbsp;like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Since you have been longing for the milk of God&rsquo;s word, you have grown spiritually as Peter commanded. That growth has provoked your conscience into confessing your sin, also as Peter anticipated. Studying God&rsquo;s word causes us to evaluate our lives in relationship to the commands and holiness of God, which sanctifies us over time. This is the process you are experiencing, and we encourage you to work with the Spirit by yielding to His counsel in your heart.</p>\n\n<p>Out of love for your wife, you should confess all your sins (e.g., the sin of fornication, the sin of lying and the sin of continuing deception). Will she be upset? Probably. Will she forgive you? Possibly. Regardless of her response, however, you are obligated to do the right thing by God. Ironically, your hesitation to confess your sin is partly due to your desire to please your wife (i.e., to not upset her), yet scripture says we must seek to please God, not people. Pleasing the Lord, in this case, means confessing your sin to your wife and asking for her forgiveness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as you speak with your wife, we encourage you to explain the timing of your confession as an indication of your spiritual growth. It may help her forgive you when she learns that the Lord is working in your heart to bring you into a closer walk with Him, and this confession is the&nbsp;fruit of that spiritual work.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: In many places, you teach that the Angel of the Lord is always the Second Person of the Godhead, that is the </strong></em><em><strong>pre-incarnate</strong></em><em><strong> Christ. How do you know this is to be so?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>A</strong>: Scripture clearly shows &nbsp;the Angel of the Lord is the Second Person of the Godhead. &nbsp;Next, we need to consider why we believe the Angel of the Lord is, in particular, the pre-incarnate Lord Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>The term &ldquo;the Angel of the Lord&rdquo; first appears in&nbsp;Genesis 16:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;7 Now the angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur. 8 He said, &ldquo;Hagar, Sarai&rsquo;s maid, where have you come from and where are you going?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.&rdquo;&nbsp; 9 Then the angel of the LORD said to her, &ldquo;Return to your mistress, and submit yourself to her authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; 10 Moreover, the angel of the LORD said to her, &ldquo;I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count.&rdquo;&nbsp; 11 The angel of the LORD said to her further, &ldquo;Behold, you are with child, And you will bear a son; And you shall call his name Ishmael, Because the LORD has given heed to your affliction.&nbsp; 12 &ldquo;He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be against everyone, And everyone&rsquo;s hand will be against him; And he will live to the east of all his brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; 13 Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, &ldquo;You are a God who sees&rdquo;; for she said, &ldquo;Have I even remained alive here after seeing Him?&rdquo; 14 Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice a few things here.&nbsp;First, the Angel of the Lord tells Hagar that He will &ldquo;greatly multiply your descendants.&rdquo;&nbsp;An ordinary angel cannot do that, for only the Lord God can give life (Deuteronomy 32:39).&nbsp;Also, this statement is very similar to what God told Abraham (Genesis 15:5).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Second, the Angel of the Lord knew Hagar was with child, that the child was a son, and what he would be like.&nbsp;Only God is omniscient to know the future (e.g., Hebrews 4:3), though ordinary angels can be told the future by God.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Third, in v. 11, the angel says &ldquo;the LORD has given heed to your affliction&rdquo; when it was the Angel of the Lord who had given heed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in v. 13, the text says &ldquo;the name of the LORD who spoke to her,\" clearly indicating that Hagar was speaking to God.&nbsp;Furthermore, Hagar calls the Angel \"God\" and can&rsquo;t believe she remained alive after seeing Him!&nbsp;Indeed, the word Beer-lahai-roi means, &ldquo;well of the Living One seeing me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Next, we look at Genesis 22:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;1 But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, &ldquo;Abraham, Abraham!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>12 He said, &ldquo;Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.&rdquo;&hellip; 15 Then the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, 16 and said, &ldquo;By Myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son, 17 indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies. 18 In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>In both of these passages, it&rsquo;s clear that the Angel of the Lord is also God.&nbsp;In v. 12 He says you have not withheld your son &ldquo;from Me,&rdquo; obviously referring to God.&nbsp;In vs. 15 and 16, the Angel of the Lord says of Himself &ldquo;by Myself&hellip;declares the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;Again, it&rsquo;s clear the Angel of the Lord and God are One and the same.</p>\n\n<p>Next, consider Exodus 3:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;1 Now Moses was pasturing the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. 2 The angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing fire from the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, yet the bush was not consumed. 3 So Moses said, &ldquo;I must turn aside now and see this marvelous sight, why the bush is not burned up.&rdquo; 4 When the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, &ldquo;Moses, Moses!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo; 5 Then He said, &ldquo;Do not come near here; remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.&rdquo; 6 He said also, &ldquo;I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&rdquo; Then Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>The Angel of the Lord in v.2 is&nbsp;clearly equated with God in v.4.&nbsp;In v.6, He makes clear He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses understands, for he is afraid to look at God (remember Hagar above).</p>\n\n<p>There are many, many more passages that demonstrate that the Angel of the Lord is, in fact, God Himself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But how do we know this appearance of God is always the pre-incarnate Jesus?</p>\n\n<p>First, we know the Godhead is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but in John 6: 46, Jesus says, &ldquo;46 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who is from God; He has seen the Father.&rdquo;&nbsp;Since no one has seen the Father, and since people <em>did</em> see the Angel of the Lord, we can, therefore, know that the angel of the Lord cannot be the Father.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the Holy Spirit never takes human form, and rarely does the Spirit take any form.&nbsp;He took the form of a dove when Jesus was baptized (Matthew 3:16), and as tongues of fire at Pentecost (Acts 2:3-4), but He is never shown in scripture to assume the form of man. Therefore, we have no reason to assume these OT appearances of the Angel of the Lord are the Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Paul says that Jesus has always been the \"image of the invisible God\" in Colossians:</p>\n\n<h5>Col. 1:15 &nbsp;He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.<br />\nCol. 1:16 For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities &mdash; all things have been created through Him and for Him.<br />\nCol. 1:17 He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.<br />\nCol. 1:18 He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything.<br />\nCol. 1:19 For it was the Father&rsquo;s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him,<br />\nCol. 1:20 and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Consequently, the Angel of the Lord is the image of the invisible God in the days before Jesus took on flesh, which&nbsp;is why we say He is the &ldquo;pre-incarnate&rdquo; Christ.&nbsp;Furthermore, the Angel of the Lord never appears in the New Testament, once Jesus took on flesh (became incarnate), nor after His resurrection.&nbsp;The only mention of such a person in the New Testament is described as &ldquo;an&rdquo; angel of the Lord, but never &ldquo;the&rdquo; Angel of the Lord.&nbsp;Once God the Son appeared as flesh, there was no longer a need for Him to appear in any other form as &ldquo;the Angel of the Lord&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it&#39;s interesting to consider that&nbsp;the word &ldquo;angel&rdquo; means messenger.&nbsp;A messenger is one who is sent from someone else to deliver a message, and of course, Jesus fits this perfectly.&nbsp;He says in John 8:18, &ldquo;I am He who testifies about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me.&rdquo;&nbsp;Just as the Father sent Jesus, so also did He send the Angel of the Lord.&nbsp;Based on all the above, we conclude that the pre-incarnate Lord Jesus was the Angel of the Lord.</p>"

Instead, He instructs us to seek&nbsp;God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness first so that the rest may come in due time:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;25 &ldquo;For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. &nbsp;Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? &nbsp;26 Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. &nbsp;Are you not worth much more than they? &nbsp;27 And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life? &nbsp;28 And why are you worried about clothing? &nbsp;Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin, 29 yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. &nbsp;30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? &nbsp;You of little faith! &nbsp;31 Do not worry then, saying, &lsquo;What will we eat?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What will we drink?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What will we wear for clothing?&rsquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;32 For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. &nbsp;33 But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.&nbsp; 34 &ldquo;So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will care for itself.&nbsp; Each day has enough trouble of its own.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Considering this teaching, we then return to Psalm 128 to understand that the psalmist is describing a person who is not worried about what he will eat or drink or wear.&nbsp;Such a person trusts that the Lord will take care of such things.&nbsp;As such, he will be happy &ldquo;when you shall eat of the fruit of your hands&rdquo; (Psalm 128:2).&nbsp; Furthermore, with respect to his wife and children, it appears that they, too, are believers, as the text says, &ldquo;How blessed is&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;who fears the LORD.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>So, our motivation for living Godly lives in Christ Jesus is to glorify God. As <a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\">1Corinthians 10:31</a> says:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>And as <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans 12</a> says:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;1 Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.&nbsp; 2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>We do this by doing good (practicing His righteousness) and seeking His kingdom.&nbsp;This would include evangelizing the lost and making disciples.&nbsp;It includes growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, which is done through prayer and the study of God&rsquo;s word, all by the power of His Spirit who lives and dwells within us.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Scripture makes clear that this earth is not our home.&nbsp;Like Abraham, we live as aliens in a foreign land, and we are looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.&nbsp;We are to desire a better country, a heavenly one, and our God has prepared such <strong><a href=\"/bible-answers/what-is-the-new-jerusalem\">a city</a></strong> for us (<a href=\"/bible-studies/hebrews\">Hebrews 11</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we must conclude that in this life, our goal is to glorify God.&nbsp;Some will also be blessed with earthly riches, just as Abraham was, but even then, we do not seek such riches, nor is that our goal, just as it was not Abraham&rsquo;s goal.&nbsp;Indeed, if we have such riches, we use them for God&rsquo;s service, just as Joseph of Arimathea used his tomb for the burial of the Lord.&nbsp;Some will not have such riches, as our Lord did not have them.&nbsp;We are to be like Paul in Philippians 4:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity.&nbsp; 11 Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.&nbsp; 12 I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need.&nbsp; 13 I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.&nbsp; 14 Nevertheless, you have done well to share with me in my affliction.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Clearly, we can only do this in the power of the Spirit of Christ, just as Paul says in v. 13 above.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, we should expect persecution as we live out a Godly life according to 2 Timothy 3:12, John 15:18-20, James 1:2-4, 1 Peter 1:6-9, among others.&nbsp;Persecution is to be expected, according to scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we also seek God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness with an expectation not of earthly rewards, but of heavenly rewards.&nbsp;If we have&nbsp;a motivation of pleasing God, He will be pleased with us, and praise will come from Him and not men. In 1 Corinthians 3:10-15 Paul talks about heavenly rewards, so we should live in expectation of them.&nbsp;Only those works that are done with a motivation to please God and not men &ndash; works done in the Spirit and not in the flesh &ndash; will receive heavenly rewards.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: I am divorced and remarried. My church demands that I leave my second wife and remain single before the church will baptize me in water. Is this biblical?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;The Bible places one and only one condition for receiving water baptism: a personal belief in and public confession of Jesus Christ:</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 8:34&nbsp;The eunuch answered Philip and said, &ldquo;Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself or of someone else?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nActs 8:35&nbsp;Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him.&nbsp;<br />\nActs 8:36&nbsp;As they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch&nbsp; said, &ldquo;Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nActs 8:37&nbsp;[And Philip said, &ldquo;If you believe with all your heart, you may.&rdquo; And he answered and said, &ldquo;I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&rdquo;]&nbsp;<br />\nActs 8:38&nbsp;And he ordered the chariot to stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and he baptized him.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice when the eunuch makes a public confession of Christ in v.37 and then asks Philip &ldquo;what prevents me from being baptized?&#39;&nbsp;Philip answers that if he believed&nbsp;in Jesus, he may be baptized. Once the eunuch made his confession of faith, Philip said he may enter into the water. This is the Bible&rsquo;s teaching on water baptism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Water baptism is the first command Christ issued for all new believers (see Matt 28:19), and the only prerequisite is faith in Jesus Christ made evident through a public confession. It&#39;s worth noting that an infant cannot make a public profession much less take the step of entering the water. Therefore, infant \"baptism\" is not truly baptism. It is merely a bath. Only a person who is old enough to confess Christ publicly and enter the water by his or her own choice&nbsp;is capable of receiving a true baptism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, divorce and remarriage have no bearing on faith and baptism. In fact, no previous sin makes someone ineligible to receive water baptism in response to faith in Christ. On the contrary, believers are called to receive water baptism as a sign that they believe they have been cleansed by the Holy Spirit from all sin as a result of faith in Jesus Christ!</p>\n\n<p>Remember Christ&rsquo;s words:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 9:12&nbsp;But when Jesus heard this, He said, &ldquo;It is not those who are healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick.<br />\nMatt. 9:13&nbsp;&ldquo;But go and learn what this means: &lsquo;I desire compassion, and not sacrifice,&rsquo; for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Given what your church is teaching, you should seek fellowship elsewhere in a church&nbsp;that understands and practices baptism properly. All men and women are called to receive Christ in faith and accept water baptism as a sign of their faith. There is no other condition required.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more information on what the Bible says concerning baptism and marriage and divorce, please read the following articles on <a href=\"/bible-answers/is_baptism_required_for_salvation\">Water Baptism</a> and <a href=\"/bible-answers/can-a-believer-divorce-or-remarry\">Divorce and Remarriage</a> from our website:</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Will the church saints </strong></em><em><strong>raptured</strong></em><em><strong> prior to the Tribulation be able to view events on Earth during the Tribulation?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;There is some mystery regarding what those who have died know about events on earth after their departure, including during Tribulation. The only answer to solving that mystery is found in Revelation 6:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 6:9&nbsp; When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained;&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 6:10&nbsp;and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;How long, O Lord, holy and true, will You refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 6:11&nbsp;And there was given to each of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for a little while longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed even as they had been, would be completed also.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>This scene from the book of Revelation takes place in the future, during the time of Tribulation on earth. In the first half of this seven-year period, many believers will be martyred for their faith as a result of the rise of the antichrist. In v.9, John describes seeing under the altar the souls of those killed on earth because of their testimony of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Notice these souls are conscious and aware of how they arrived in Heaven (i.e., as a result of persecution). In v.10, they ask the Lord how long the Lord will delay in avenging their death, which tells us they also retain memories of their experiences on earth. Since they know the Lord has not yet avenged their death, they must be aware that the Tribulation is still underway and that the Lord had not yet brought an end to the antichrist&rsquo;s reign of terror on earth.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there is no indication that these souls are viewing life on earth or have an awareness of specific events. On the contrary, they seem to exist in a completely different and separate realm apart from the earth and without the&nbsp;possibility of seeing the earth. In the same way that a human being alive today can&#39;t see events happening on the other side of our planet (without an electronic medium like TV or the internet), similarly a soul in Heaven cannot see the events of the earth unless God reveals it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we conclude&nbsp;from the information&nbsp;available in scripture that those who have died and entered the throne room of God are not capable of viewing events on earth,&nbsp;whether now or in&nbsp;the Tribulation. More than likely, they are not the least bit interested either, since we presume that the Heavenly world is far more interesting and captivating (1Cor 2:9).</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q; I find several places in the Bible of men were Jesus seems to contradict Himself concerning whether an unbeliever can accomplish miraculous works in His name. Can you help me reconcile Luke 9:49-50, Matthew 12:26 and Matthew 7:22? Can unbelievers accomplish miracles?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A: Here are the passages you quoted:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 9:49 &nbsp;John answered and said, &ldquo;Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name; and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow along with us.&rdquo;<br />\nLuke 9:50 But Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Do not hinder him; for he who is not against you is for you.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>Matt. 12:26 &ldquo;If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Matt. 7:22 &ldquo;Many will say to Me on that day, &lsquo;Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?&rsquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Regarding each of the passages you cited, here are some general observations:</p>\n\n<p>First, Luke 9:49-50 is speaking of those working by the Spirit of God yet who were&nbsp;not publicly identified as disciples following Jesus. These men were successfully casting out demons &ldquo;in Jesus name,&rdquo; which means they were operating in the power and authority of the Lord, which had been granted to them by the Spirit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The disciples objected because these other men were not a part of the group following Jesus, but Jesus corrects their assumptions. The Lord says He is capable of working through others who were unknown to the disciples. Therefore they must not judge others merely by human associations. If a person works in like manner for a shared outcome to the glory of Christ, then we can assume they are working by the Spirit like us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Matthew 12:26, Jesus explained that Satan would never work against his own purposes. Jesus spoke&nbsp;these words because the Pharisees had accused Jesus of doing that very thing. Jesus explained that it would be illogical to expect Satan to lend his power to anyone for the purpose of increasing the Lord&#39;s glory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Jesus was NOT declaring that Satan never grants a person the power to send out a demon. On the contrary, Satan is the ruler of the demons, and, therefore, he can send demons into our out of an unbeliever&rsquo;s body at will. Satan may grant the power to one of his agents to cast out demons from another of his agents to gain attention and loyalty from an audience for his evil agenda. False teachers and false prophets have long demonstrated supernatural power granted by Satan, including the power to control the demonic realm. The enemy uses this deception to win an audience for his claims.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But as Jesus said, the enemy will never use his power to further the glory or goals of the Lord, which was the point Jesus was making to the Pharisees. Therefore, we cannot say that those who cast out demons must be believers because sometimes unbelievers cast out demons to further the purposes of Satan. We can only say that those who bring glory to Jesus in their work to further the kingdom are not our enemies. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This&nbsp;explains why then in Matthew 7:22 Jesus declares that some will prophesy and cast out demons in Jesus&rsquo; name, yet He will say He doesn&rsquo;t know them at the judgment. These are unbelievers who were under the influence of false teaching and were working in the power of Satan to accomplish great miracles, but they didn&rsquo;t have the Spirit and didn&rsquo;t know the true Gospel. Present-day examples of such people include Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, Mormons, and other unbelievers trapped in many Pentecostal movements around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there is no example in scripture of the Lord granting an unbeliever spiritual power to perform miracles, but there are many occasions of Satan granting such power to unbelievers (including the antichrist to come). Therefore, we cannot make a determination concerning someone&rsquo;s spiritual status (i.e., believer vs. unbeliever) merely by whether they can perform supernatural signs. This is why the Bible warns against seeking for such signs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Bible is clear that the unbeliever&rsquo;s prayers are &ldquo;heard&rdquo; by God in the sense that the Spirit isn&rsquo;t working within such a person to bring their prayers into alignment with the will of God.&nbsp;</p>"

Therefore, the words of that prophecy are only relevant to the Jewish people. Notice in v.2 the Lord specifically says these words are for His people Israel:</p>\n\n<h5>Amos 8:2&nbsp;He said, &ldquo;What do you see, Amos?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;A basket of summer fruit.&rdquo; Then the LORD said to me, &ldquo;The end has come for My people Israel. I will spare them no longer.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Proper interpretation of scripture requires that we apply the words of scripture in the way the author intended, and in this case the author is clearly speaking to the nation of Israel alone. Furthermore, the events of this passage are specifically dealing with the event of Tribulation, which has not happened to Israel yet. Notice the details:</p>\n\n<h5>Amos 8:7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Indeed, I will never forget any of their deeds.&nbsp;<br />\nAmos 8:8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Because of this will not the land quake&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And everyone who dwells in it mourn?&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Indeed, all of it will rise up like the Nile,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And it will be tossed about&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And subside like the Nile of Egypt.&nbsp;<br />\nAmos 8:9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;It will come about in that day,&rdquo; declares the Lord GOD,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;That I will make the sun go down at noon&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And make the earth dark in broad daylight.&nbsp;<br />\nAmos 8:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Then I will turn your festivals into mourning&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And all your songs into lamentation;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And I will bring sackcloth on everyone&rsquo;s loins&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And baldness on every head.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And I will make it like a time of mourning for an only son,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the end of it will be like a bitter day.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The events described here are not events of common judgment but rather are extraordinary events that come upon Israel (and the whole world).

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: What does the Bible say about a Christian carrying a weapon for self-defense?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A: The Bible teaches in various places that a believer may act in self-defense or defense of others without sinning, including acts of defense that involve taking the life of another when necessary.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/CSD-Old-Defense-Ha-Pic.jpg\" style=\"width: 360px; height: 240px; float: right; margin: 10px 15px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Some turn to the sixth commandment&#39;s prohibition against murder to claim that the Bible prohibits&nbsp;taking any life under any circumstances, but this is not a correct interpretation. The word murder means, by definition, the <strong><em>unlawful</em></strong> taking of life. Exodus 20 uses the Hebrew word for murder (<em>ratzach</em>) rather than&nbsp;the word for kill (<em>harag</em>) to acknowledge some forms of killing are justified and therefore not sin.</p>\n\n<p>According to scripture, lawful forms of killing include during wartime against enemies of peace (<em>e.g., Numbers 21:1-3</em>), by the government as a just punishment for&nbsp;crime (<em>e.g., Romans 13:3-4</em>), in self-defense (e.g., Exodus 22:2-3), and in defense of others (<em>e.g., Exodu</em><em>s 2:11-12 </em>).</p>\n\n<p>Even Jesus implied the need for his disciples to&nbsp;prepare for self-defense against those who might threaten them as fellow \"transgressors\" once Jesus had been condemned, so He gave these instructions:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 22:35 &nbsp;And He said to them, &ldquo;When I sent you out without money belt and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;No, nothing.&rdquo;<br />\nLuke 22:36 And He said to them, &ldquo;But now, whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword is to sell his coat and buy one.<br />\nLuke 22:37 &ldquo;For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me, &lsquo;And He was numbered with transgressors&rsquo;; for that which refers to Me has its fulfillment.&rdquo;<br />\nLuke 22:38 They said, &ldquo;Lord, look, here are two swords.&rdquo; And He said to them, &ldquo;It is enough.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>The means we choose to employ for self-defense (i.e., martial arts, sticks, knives, guns, etc.) are not necessarily important so long as our actions do not go beyond the reasonable needs of self-defense or turn to vengeance, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 12:17&nbsp;Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 12:18&nbsp;If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 12:19&nbsp;Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, &ldquo;Vengeance is mine, I will repay,&rdquo; says the Lord.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul says our goal is to remain&nbsp;at peace with men so long as the situation depends on our choices and actions. On the other hand, if another breaks the peace with us, then we are justified to act in defense so long as we don&rsquo;t move to acting in vengeance. Acting in vengeance&nbsp;is initiating revengeful conflict out of malice for another while self-defense is acting without malice to halt or prevent the attack of another. If our actions shift from halting an attack to prosecuting our own attack, then we have crossed the line into sin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind&nbsp;Paul&#39;s command for believers to seek for peace with others to the degree possible&nbsp;presumes we will make every effort&nbsp;to avoid potential conflict <strong><em>before</em></strong> it escalates to violence. If we sense a conflict developing around us, we should seek an escape or retreat if reasonably possible. The Bible&#39;s acknowledgment of the right to act in self-defense&nbsp;cannot become a license&nbsp;for us to choose a violent response when other, non-violent options were still available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as Jesus advised in Luke 22 a Christian may take prudent measures to mitigate&nbsp;potential risks, including taking self-defense courses, lawfully carrying weapons or even acting preemptively&nbsp;against a threat when required to protect life or property. Any actions we take must be in keeping with the laws of our land since Christians are also required to obey and uphold the law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the end, the key test for whether we act properly under any circumstances is determined by&nbsp;the motives of our heart. If we act with evil intentions, then we sin; if we act to thwart evil and protect the innocent, then we do not sin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

Is that true?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA.&nbsp; The Bible never uses the word &ldquo;curse&rdquo; in describing the consequences for a believer. In the Bible, a curse from the Lord always means death and judgment. It is never correct to say that the Lord curses a believer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Bible does not speak of a curse for those who cause conflict or strife, though these behaviors are likely sin nonetheless. Every believer sins, and the Bible commands all believers to put away sin and seek to live by the commandments of Christ. A believer who fails to obey God&rsquo;s word may receive a rebuke from the Lord as Hebrews teaches:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 12:7&nbsp;It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 12:8&nbsp;But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 12:9&nbsp;Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 12:10&nbsp;For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 12:11&nbsp;All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Still, we cannot say that any believer is placed under a curse, for a curse from God always results in damnation. The idea that God may curse people (in the sense of bringing bad luck or terrible experiences in life) comes from&nbsp;pagan religion and false teaching. The Bible says the Lord acts in all ways for the good of the believer:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:28&nbsp; And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.&nbsp;</h5>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. I would like some basic advice on preaching. How do I get started?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA.&nbsp; Our ministry does not provide personal counseling services though we can offer some basic advice on preaching. First, preaching is a process of expositing (or explaining) the word of God. Preaching is not speech-giving nor is it merely entertaining. Preaching is always a matter of teaching and applying the word of God to God&rsquo;s people, as Paul said:</p>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 4:1&nbsp; I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:&nbsp;<br />\n2Tim. 4:2&nbsp;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.&nbsp;<br />\n2Tim. 4:3&nbsp;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,&nbsp;<br />\n2Tim. 4:4&nbsp;and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice that Paul&rsquo;s primary concern to Timothy, a young preacher, was that he preach the word of God rather than simply spreading myths and useless stories. Unfortunately, many pastors and preachers today have ignored Paul&rsquo;s advice and continue to preach useless words rather than teaching God&rsquo;s word. Preaching must be centered on expositing the text of scripture or it lacks any validity.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, you cannot preach the word if you do not know the word, so every preacher must establish a life-long habit of learning the word of God. You must devote yourself to the study of scripture in an in-depth and diligent manner so that you may be prepared to teach others. There is no short cut to hours of study and preparation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, no preacher can expect to impact men and women for the kingdom unless and until they are called and equipped by the Spirit of God for that purpose. So we encourage you to seek the Lord in prayer and with the confirmation of other godly men before assuming you are called to preach the word. If other men agree you are called in this way, then they may be led by the Spirit to lay hands on you and confirm your calling.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful not to step out in preaching before you have this confirmation, as James warns:</p>\n\n<h5>James 3:1 &nbsp;Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>"

I know the Bible teaches that the Holy Spirit will be removed in the last days, but is the increasing lawlessness a sign that the Holy Spirit is releasing&nbsp;His grip already?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA.&nbsp; The Bible teaches that lawlessness and ungodliness will increase in the last days, but the Bible never suggests that this trend is the result of the Holy Spirit &ldquo;releasing His grip&rdquo; on the world. The Lord is always 100% in control of all that happens in Creation, and the rise of lawlessness is according to His eternal purposes.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Bible does teach that the Holy Spirit is a &ldquo;restrainer&rdquo; but only in a very particular sense:</p>\n\n<h5>2Th. 2:5&nbsp;Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things?&nbsp;<br />\n2Th. 2:6&nbsp;And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed.&nbsp;<br />\n2Th. 2:7&nbsp;For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Holy Spirit is restraining the appearance of the antichrist. This is not a restraint on evil itself but only on the revealing of the antichrist. Until the Holy Spirit is removed with the church at the resurrection (i.e., the rapture), the antichrist&rsquo;s identity cannot be known. The Holy Spirit is restraining Satan&rsquo;s ability to bring forth an antichrist to rule the world. Only in the sense is the Holy Spirit a restrainer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The rise of lawlessness is a trend that must happen even as the Holy Spirit is present and working on the earth, and this rise is according to God&rsquo;s purposes in bringing about the end of this age.

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. In reading&nbsp;Mark 9:39, it seems as though the Lord teaches that those who cast out demons in his name are to be treated as believers, and yet in Luke 11:18, Mark 3:26, and Matthew 12:26, Jesus says that there will be those who cast our demons in His </strong></em><em><strong>name</strong></em><em><strong> but He does not know them. Can you help me understand this difference?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA.&nbsp; Regarding each of the passages you cited, here are some general observations. First, Luke 9:49-50 &amp; Mark 9:39 are both speaking of those who are working by means of the Spirit of God though not publicly identified as disciples following Jesus. These men were successfully casting out demons &ldquo;in Jesus name,&rdquo; which means they were operating in the power and authority of the Lord, which had been granted to them by the Spirit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The disciples objected to these men working in this way, because these other men were not a part of the group following Jesus, but Jesus rejects their assumptions. The Lord says God is capable of working through others who were unknown to the disciples, therefore they must not judge others merely by human associations. If a person works in like manner for a shared outcome to the glory of Christ, then we can assume they are working by the same Spirit as us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Regarding&nbsp;Luke 11:18, Mark 3:26, and Matthew 12:26, Jesus said that Satan will never work against his own purposes. Jesus spoke&nbsp;these words because the Pharisees had accused Jesus of performing a miracle of casting out a demon using the power of Satan. Jesus explained that it would be illogical to expect Satan to lend his power to anyone for the purpose of increasing the Lord&#39;s glory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Jesus was NOT declaring that Satan never grants a person the power to send out a demon. On the contrary, Satan is the ruler of the demons, and therefore he can send demons into our out of an unbeliever&rsquo;s body at will. Satan may grant the power to one of his agents to cast out demons from another of his agents in order to gain attention and loyalty from an audience for his evil agenda. False teachers and false prophets have long demonstrated supernatural power granted by Satan, including the power to control the demonic realm. The enemy uses this deception to win an audience for his claims.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But as Jesus said, the enemy will never use his power to further the glory or goals of the Lord, which was the point Jesus was making to the Pharisees. Therefore, we cannot say that those who cast out demons must be believers, because sometimes unbelievers cast out demons to further the purposes of Satan. We can only say that those who bring glory to Jesus in their work to further the kingdom are not our enemies. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This truth explains why in Matthew 7:22 Jesus declares that some will prophesy and cast out demons in Jesus&rsquo; name yet He will say He doesn&rsquo;t know them at the judgment. These are unbelievers who were under the influence of false teaching and were working in the power of Satan to accomplish great miracles, but they didn&rsquo;t have the Spirit and didn&rsquo;t know the true Gospel. Present-day examples of such people include Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, Mormons, and unbelievers trapped in many pentecostal movements around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there is no example in scripture of the Lord granting an unbeliever spiritual power to perform miracles, but there are many occasions of Satan granting such power to unbelievers (including the antichrist to come). Therefore, we cannot make a determination concerning someone&rsquo;s spiritual status (i.e., believer vs. unbeliever) merely on the basis of whether they can perform supernatural signs. This is why the Bible warns against seeking for such signs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Bible is clear that the unbeliever&rsquo;s prayers are &ldquo;heard&rdquo; by God in the sense that the Spirit isn&rsquo;t working within such a person to bring their prayers into alignment with the will of God.&nbsp;</p>"

Why doesn&#39;t the Lord reveal Himself to people through dreams to tell them to believe in Him especially in places like Asia and the Middle East?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA.&nbsp; The Bible teaches that though the Lord used a variety of methods to reach the world in the past, today the Lord uses His word to reach the world with the truth of the Gospel:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 1:1&nbsp;&nbsp;God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 1:2&nbsp;&nbsp;in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul echoes this truth in Romans and in 1Corinthians:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 10:17&nbsp;So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 1:21&nbsp;For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:22&nbsp;For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:23&nbsp;but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:24&nbsp;but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 2:2&nbsp;For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 2:3&nbsp;I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 2:4&nbsp;and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 2:5&nbsp;so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Bible teaches that the Lord used lessor methods to reveal Himself in past times (i.e., prophets, dreams, etc.) as a temporary measure until the arrival of His Son Jesus Christ. Once Christ was revealed and the canon of scripture complete, the Lord relies exclusively on the word of God.&nbsp;<br />\nAnd the Lord is fully capable of bringing His word to everyone and anyone as He chooses. The Lord will not leave any of His elect behind, as Jesus said in John 6:</p>\n\n<h5>John 6:37&nbsp;&ldquo;All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out.<br />\nJohn 6:38&nbsp;&ldquo;For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.<br />\nJohn 6:39&nbsp;&ldquo;This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day.<br />\nJohn 6:40&nbsp;&ldquo;For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>On occasion, we have heard reports that the Spirit is still using dreams or other means to draw men to Him, especially in Asia and the Middle East. These experiences appear to be limited to areas where the word of God is not yet easily available, and so the Spirit must use other methods as a temporary measure. Nevertheless, these experiences are always followed by the introduction of the word of God, so that the person may gain the full counsel of Christ by His word.</p>\n\n<p>We advise you to be cautious when dealing with any report of a so-called prophetic dream or revelation. Often these reports are not credible or find their source in demonic activity. Even when the Lord may be using dreams to draw unbelievers to the Gospel, these measures are not a substitute for the word of God.</p>"

While we cannot judge a person&#39;s heart, we can investigate the teachings and beliefs of a religious system like Catholicism to evaluate whether it accurately reflects the truth of scripture.</p>\n\n<p>In evaluating Catholicism, we find&nbsp;the doctrines, beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church to be unbiblical. By&nbsp;far the most important distinction between Catholicism and Christianity is their teaching on salvation. How one gets to Heaven is the most important question a person can ask, but the answers offered by scripture and by the Catholic Church are radically different, and any religion that does not agree with Scripture regarding salvation is, by definition, a false religion.</p>\n\n<p>Scripture is very clear how one receives salvation. The Bible says that salvation is found by faith alone in Christ alone:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 10:8 But what does it say? &ldquo;THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART&rdquo; &mdash; that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,<br />\nRom. 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;<br />\nRom. 10:10 for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Faith alone in Jesus Christ alone is the means to salvation according to the Bible. Diving deeper, the Bible says that all men are sinners, deserving of God&rsquo;s wrath.&nbsp;Our sin has separated us from God, and our sin must be punished because God is a holy and just God.&nbsp; To avoid that penalty and enter into Heaven, we&nbsp;must be perfectly righteous and&nbsp;without sin and thus reconciled to God.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>The Gospel according to the Bible teaches that reconciliation with God is found only through faith in the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ on our behalf as a matter of&nbsp;God&rsquo;s grace and mercy, not as a result of our own merit or good works. Those of faith in Jesus place their trust in Jesus&#39; death on the cross for our sins, a death we rightly&nbsp;deserved. In this way, the Father can be just in not overlooking our sin, since He placed our sin on His Son. In addition, Scripture says that when we have faith in Christ, His perfect righteousness is imputed (or credited) to the believer so we may enter into Heaven.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So by faith in Jesus our sins have been justly punished (on Christ) and we have been made perfect (by receiving Christ&#39;s righteousness), and these outcomes are the result of Christ&#39;s work on our behalf,&nbsp;not because of anything we did for ourselves.&nbsp;In fact, the only thing we bring to our salvation is our sin, which Christ takes from us. Any&nbsp;supposed \"good\" works we might do count for nothing to God since Jesus has accomplished everything necessary for our salvation.&nbsp;That is why we call this truth&nbsp;the &ldquo;gospel,\"&nbsp;which means &ldquo;good news.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Catholic church does not hold to this&nbsp;gospel. Although the Catholic Church teaches that a person&#39;s salvation <em>begins</em> with faith in Jesus as Messiah, they depart from the Gospel in claiming that faith alone will not secure salvation. Catholics believe they must <em>become perfect</em>&nbsp;before they may enter into Heaven, and they teach the way to perfection is by doing penance for sin and accomplishing righteous works. It&#39;s important to note that Catholicism <em>doesn&#39;t</em> hold that a believer is assigned the perfection earned by&nbsp;Christ (as the Bible teaches); instead Catholics believe that each believer&nbsp;must become perfect in himself by his own works. This teaching is contrary to the Bible and is a false gospel.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, Catholics teach that salvation is dependent on personal works of righteousness, which stands in stark contrast to Paul&#39;s words in Ephesians 2:8-9:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;<br />\nEph. 2:9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So while we could list many differences between the Catholic Church and biblical Christianity, the&nbsp;most important difference centers on the Gospel itself, and this disagreement over the true Gospel&nbsp;was largely responsible for&nbsp;the rise of the Reformation and the existence of Protestant churches today. In the sixteenth century, the Lord led Martin Luther to shine forth the light of the true gospel again in opposition to the heresy of the Catholic Church by teaching that a person is saved by faith alone in Christ alone. Naturally, Luther&#39;s teaching put him at odds with the Catholic Church and the Reformation followed.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of the Reformation, the Catholic church convened a church council to refute the teachings of the Reformers (i.e., Martin Luther, John Calvin, and many others).&nbsp;This council, called the Council of Trent, became the official teaching of the Catholic church&nbsp;and remains their official teaching to this day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the Catholic church teaches that when the pope and the magisterium (the bishops of the church) teach something with respect to faith and morals, such as was taught at the Council of Trent, that teaching is infallible.&nbsp; Since it is &ldquo;infallible&rdquo;, every Catholic must accept this teaching without question.&nbsp; To do otherwise makes one a bad Catholic, meaning that person would be in open rebellion to the church&rsquo;s official, infallible teaching.&nbsp; As far as the Catholic church is concerned, it is just as bad as rejecting the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of this teaching from the Council of Trent are shown below.&nbsp; Remember, each one of these statements is considered infallible and, therefore, equal with Scripture for Catholics, as the Catholic church believes the Holy Spirit leads the pope to proclaim such infallible statements:</p>\n\n<h5>CANON XI.-If any one saith, that men are justified, either by the sole imputation of the justice of Christ, or by the sole remission of sins, to the exclusion of the grace and the charity which is poured forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inherent in them; or even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the favour of God; let him be anathema.</h5>\n\n<h5>CANON XII.-If any one saith, that justifying faith is nothing else but confidence in the divine mercy which remits sins for Christ&#39;s sake; or, that this confidence alone is that whereby we are justified; let him be anathema.</h5>\n\n<h5>CANON XX.-If any one saith, that the man who is justified and how perfect soever, is not bound to observe the commandments of God and of the Church, but only to believe; as if indeed the Gospel were a bare and absolute promise of eternal life, without the condition of observing the commandments ; let him be anathema.</h5>\n\n<h5>CANON XXIV.-If any one saith, that the justice received is not preserved and also increased before God through good works; but that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of Justification obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof; let him be anathema.</h5>\n\n<h5>CANON XXVI.-If any one saith, that the just ought not, for their good works done in God, to expect and hope for an eternal recompense from God, through His mercy and the merit of Jesus Christ, if so be that they persevere to the end in well doing and in keeping the divine commandments; let him be anathema.</h5>\n\n<h5>CANON XXX.-If any one saith, that, after the grace of Justification has been received, to every penitent sinner the guilt is remitted, and the debt of eternal punishment is blotted out in such wise, that there remains not any debt of temporal punishment to be discharged either in this world, or in the next in Purgatory, before the entrance to the kingdom of heaven can be opened (to him); let him be anathema.</h5>\n\n<h5>CANON XXXII.-If any one saith, that the good works of one that is justified are in such manner the gifts of God, as that they are not also the good merits of him that is justified; or, that the said justified, by the good works which he performs through the grace of God and the merit of Jesus Christ, whose living member he is, does not truly merit increase of grace, eternal life, and the attainment of that eternal life,-if so be, however, that he depart in grace,-and also an increase of glory; let him be anathema.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>These statements all state that anyone who says salvation is by faith alone is categorically wrong and must be excluded from the Church. For the Catholic, salvation is about works, not faith alone.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, these beliefs contradict Scripture in many places, including:</p>\n\n<p>Romans 5:19, &ldquo;19 For as through the one man&rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Romans 5 provides a contrast between Adam and Jesus.&nbsp; In Adam, we are all made sinners because of his sin.&nbsp; In Christ, believers are made righteous by Christ&rsquo;s obedience.&nbsp; Notice that it is not by our works that we are considered righteous, as the Catholic church falsely teaches.&nbsp; Rather, it is solely by Christ&rsquo;s obedience that we are made righteous.</p>\n\n<p>Preaching a different gospel is the most serious error of the Catholic religion (and there are many others), but this difference alone makes the Catholic Church a false religion, as scripture says in Galatians 1:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!&nbsp; 9 As we have said before, so I say again&nbsp;now,&nbsp;if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Though Catholics acknowledge&nbsp;Jesus (then again, even the Muslims acknowledge&nbsp;Jesus), nevertheless the Catholic church preaches&nbsp;a gospel contrary to the one Jesus delivered to us.&nbsp;Therefore according to Paul, the Catholic Church is not a Christian church; it is&nbsp;a false church.</p>\n\n<p>So can we expect believers to be found in the Catholic Church?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Since the Catholic Church presents a false gospel that cannot bring men and women into Heaven and rescue them from Hell, why would a true believer choose to remain in a church that teaches a false gospel?&nbsp; This would be no different than a believer attending a Mormon church, a Jehovah Witness church, or any other false church.&nbsp;Why would a believer stay in a church that teaches and believes that which is contrary to the very word of God?</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, some believers (very few in our experience) do choose to remain in the Catholic Church. Some remain because they do not realize the differences between the true Gospel and the teaching of the Catholic Church. Others remain because family ties and tradition overrule sound judgment. Still others remain as a mission to reach other Catholics with the truth. Therefore, we cannot say that there are no believers in the Catholic Church, but where believers can be found in that religion, it is only because God&#39;s grace has overcome the false teaching in that system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Still, choosing to remain in the Catholic system of religion after coming to a saving faith in Jesus Christ may have a negative effect on a person&#39;s spiritual development. &nbsp;False teaching impacts a believer&rsquo;s spiritual maturity and relationships with family and friends.&nbsp;Jesus understood this, too, when He warned in Luke 12:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;51 Do you suppose that I came to grant peace on earth?&nbsp; I tell you, no, but rather division; 52 for from now on five members in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three.&nbsp; 53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and a daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nChrist must come first, even above our family and friends.&nbsp; In Luke 14, Jesus says, &ldquo;26 If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.&rdquo;&nbsp; This does not mean we should hate our family; rather, it means we must love Him more than even our family.&nbsp; Therefore, Christians must share the &nbsp;true gospel with Catholics, as this is a truly loving action.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Can you explain Paul&#39;s teaching in Ephesians 6:13-17 on the \"whole armor of God?\"</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. This is a great passage of Scripture, one we need to understand and follow.&nbsp; First and foremost, we need to put the passage into context, so let&rsquo;s look at the verses prior to this passage.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of chapter 6 of Ephesians, Paul instructs us regarding certain relationships (children and parents, fathers and children, slaves and masters, masters and slaves).&nbsp; He then moves in verse 10 to exhorting us to be strong in the Lord, and we do this by putting on the full armor of God:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.&nbsp; 11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.&nbsp; 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.&nbsp; 13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.&nbsp; 14 Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16 in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.&nbsp; 17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The context of this passage is that we need to be strong in the Lord to withstand the schemes of the devil.&nbsp; Notice that we cannot do this in our own strength; rather, we must do this in the Lord&rsquo;s strength.&nbsp; The picture is one of a soldier going into battle, and arming himself with everything available to stand firm against the enemy.&nbsp; The word&nbsp;schemes&nbsp;means &ldquo;cunning arts, deceit, trickery&rdquo;.&nbsp; That is how the devil attacks Christians so that we do not stand firm in the faith.&nbsp; This is why v. 12 says our struggle is not against humans (&ldquo;flesh and blood&rdquo;) but &ldquo;against spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places&rdquo;, which means against the devil and his demonic angels.</p>\n\n<p>James 4:7-8 says, &ldquo;Submit therefore to God.&nbsp; Resist the devil and he will flee from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw near to God and He will draw near to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, we are commanded to obey God and resist the devil.&nbsp; God does not leave us without defense, but provides us with a full body armor, one that is specially designed to resist the devil that we may stand against his attacks.&nbsp; This armor consists of girding our loins with truth, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, covering our feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace, taking up the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s consider each piece of armor.</p>\n\n<p>First, Paul tells us to &ldquo;gird our loins with truth&rdquo;.&nbsp; In Biblical times, most people, including men, wore loose-fitting garments that basically consisted of three holes:&nbsp; one for your head and one for each arm, much like a Roman toga.&nbsp; Such clothing was not conducive to running or fighting, as the looseness of the clothing could easily entangle a person in such instances.&nbsp; To remedy this, soldiers would bring up the bottom of the garment between their legs and around their torso (by their &ldquo;loins&rdquo;) and fasten it (gird) with a belt.&nbsp; The picture here is of a soldier dressed for battle.&nbsp; Likewise, when God told the Jews to leave Egypt, He told them to &ldquo;gird up their loins&rdquo;, which meant for them to be ready to move.&nbsp; So, it&rsquo;s also an expectation to be ready, be prepared for battle.</p>\n\n<p>In our case, we are &ldquo;dressed for battle&rdquo; when we fasten ourselves in the truth of God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; It has been well said that to spot counterfeit currencies, people are trained to know what the authentic currency looks like.&nbsp; Similarly, we can stand firm against Satan&rsquo;s deceit and lies when we know God&rsquo;s truth.&nbsp; This is the point of Ephesians 4:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. 14 As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNot only are we to know the truth, we are also to walk in the truth.&nbsp; Knowing God&rsquo;s word will keep us from being led astray by the devil and by sinful men who are under his influence (1 John 5:19).</p>\n\n<p>Next, we are to put on the &ldquo;breastplate of righteousness&rdquo;.&nbsp; A breastplate typically covered the soldier from the neck down to the navel.&nbsp; So, clearly, a breastplate protected a soldier&rsquo;s vital organs, his heart, liver, kidneys, etc.&nbsp; Getting shot with an arrow or hit with a sword in this area would likely be fatal.</p>\n\n<p>The Jews viewed the heart symbolically as the mind.&nbsp; Proverbs 23:7 says, &ldquo;For as he thinks in his heart, so he is.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Matthew 15 Jesus said, &ldquo;11 It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles the man, but what proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man&hellip;18 But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man.&nbsp; 19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders.&nbsp; 20 These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, what and how we think determines what we say and do.&nbsp; Thus, the heart, our minds, must be protected.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Jews associated the bowels/stomach with feelings and emotions.&nbsp; Indeed, we feel things in our stomach, in our gut.&nbsp; So, we need to also protect our emotions and feelings.</p>\n\n<p>Satan will attack the believer in his thinking and his emotions.&nbsp; He wants to get a Christian to change his thinking by his deceit and trickery, or appeal to a believer&rsquo;s emotions so as to go against God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; He does this primarily by trying to get us to doubt God, which for us is given in the Bible.&nbsp; So, his attack is against the word of God.&nbsp; He wants to cause believers to doubt the veracity of Scripture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>He does this in numerous ways, including the lie of evolution, trying to say that science disproves the Bible, or sending false teachers into the church to teach false doctrine.&nbsp; Satan has done this from the beginning, when he told Eve &ldquo;has God said?&rdquo; (Genesis 3:1)&nbsp; He wants us to doubt the Lord, rather than trust in the Lord with all of our heart as the Bible commands (Proverbs 3:5).</p>\n\n<p>So, we must protect ourselves with the breastplate of righteousness.&nbsp; The word righteousness means that we are in a right relationship with God, which comes by faith in Jesus, as His righteousness is credited to us by faith.&nbsp; This means we are now able to have right thinking, right feelings and emotions.&nbsp; We now have the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16).&nbsp; As such, by the power of the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, we can now even live righteously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thus, knowing God&rsquo;s truth, protecting our minds and emotions, and living righteously by the power of the Spirit is how we put on the breastplate of righteousness.&nbsp; As John says, &ldquo;7 Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; 8 the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.&rdquo; (1 John 3)&nbsp; If we are righteous (by faith), then we will live righteously.</p>\n\n<p>Next, Paul says to &ldquo;shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Keep in mind that all of the armor of God is meant to make us able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil (v. 11).&nbsp; So, here, putting the gospel on our feet is akin to the shoes a soldier wore to allow them to keep from slipping in battle.&nbsp; The material was a heavy bottomed sole with hobnails on the bottom, much like a modern day cleat.&nbsp; This allowed the soldier to keep his traction in battle, to stand firm.</p>\n\n<p>The same is true for Christians in that we are to stand firm in the gospel of peace.&nbsp; This means that we know that we are no longer under the wrath of God.&nbsp; Because of what Christ has done for us, we are now at peace with God.&nbsp; We can stand against the schemes of the devil knowing that God is on our side, that we are no longer His enemies (Romans 5).&nbsp; This is very similar to what Paul tells the Corinthians, &ldquo;Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 16:13)&nbsp; Now that we are believers, we have the power and resources of the Holy Spirit, who lives and dwells in us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is how we stand firm in the faith against the schemes of the devil, knowing we have peace with God, and this &ldquo;gospel of peace&rdquo; is symbolically shown to be shoes here that allow us to stand firm in the battle.</p>\n\n<p>The next piece of God&rsquo;s armor is the &ldquo;shield of faith&rdquo;.&nbsp; This type of shield was not the one you might see a soldier holding on one arm while fighting with a sword with the other hand.&nbsp; Rather, this shield was a large, four-cornered shield.&nbsp; It was covered with either metal or thick leather, and it was designed as a protection against flaming arrows shot by the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, the shield of faith protects us from Satan&rsquo;s flaming arrows.&nbsp; Notice that the shield of faith will allow us to extinguish ALL of Satan&rsquo;s flaming arrows.&nbsp; So, no matter what Satan shoots at us, the shield of faith will allow us to render them harmless.&nbsp; Now, these flaming arrows are what Satan uses to tempt us.&nbsp; They include things that appeal to the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life.&nbsp; This is how Satan always tempts us.&nbsp; He tempted Adam and Eve this way with the fruit in the Garden of Eden.&nbsp; He tempted our Lord Jesus this way.&nbsp; The temptations are always designed to lead us away from God, to be disobedient to Him.&nbsp; Our defense against these temptations is the shield of faith.</p>\n\n<p>So, what does faith mean?&nbsp; It means we believe what God has told us.&nbsp; We believe it when He says that if we believe in His Son we will have eternal life.&nbsp; We trust Him.&nbsp; So, when the devil comes along with a temptation that questions what God has told us in His word, by faith we believe what God has said and do not believe the temptation of the devil.&nbsp; Adam and Eve believed Satan&rsquo;s lie and consequently fell into sin (Genesis 3).&nbsp; Jesus believed everything God has said (Matthew 4, Luke 4), and so did not fall into Satan&rsquo;s temptations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thus the shield of faith, believing God and His word, protects us from Satan&rsquo;s flaming arrows of temptations.&nbsp; As Proverbs 30:5-6 says, &ldquo;Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.&nbsp; Do not add to His words Or He will reprove you, and you will be proved a liar.&rdquo;&nbsp; Similarly, Psalm 18:30 says, &ldquo;As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the Lord is tried; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Our next piece of armor is the helmet of salvation.&nbsp; The Roman soldier wore a helmet to protect against the enemy&rsquo;s attacks to the head, typically with a broadsword.&nbsp; This was a very large sword, 3-4 feet in length, and was designed to inflict major damage with a single blow.&nbsp; If you could hit your opponent on the head and drive the sword into the skull, you&rsquo;d probably defeat your enemy with one blow.&nbsp; So to protect against that, soldiers wore helmets.</p>\n\n<p>The helmet of salvation also protects us from Satan&rsquo;s attacks.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important to know that there are really three aspects to our salvation.&nbsp; First, we have been saved; the Bible calls this our justification, and we are justified (made right with God) through faith in Jesus.&nbsp; Through justification, we are removed from the penalty of sin, since Jesus took our punishment on the cross.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we are being saved; that is what the Bible calls sanctification.&nbsp; By the power of the Holy Spirit living and dwelling in us and by the study of His word, we can become more and more like Christ over the course of our lifetime.&nbsp; In this sense, we have the ability to escape the power of sin.&nbsp; By God&rsquo;s power, we can now choose to not sin, although we still sometimes do.</p>\n\n<p>Third, we will be saved.&nbsp; That is, God will complete our salvation ultimately when we get to heaven, when we will be glorified and will be like Him (Romans 8:30; 1 John 3:2).&nbsp; This aspect of our salvation is the hope of our salvation.&nbsp; Here, hope is not a verb, but a noun.&nbsp; Hope is not something we worry about, it is something we glory in, knowing we have been saved and have salvation to which we can look forward.&nbsp; When we are in heaven, we will be free from the presence of sin, for in heaven there is no more death, and since the wages of sin is death, there can therefore be no more sin.&nbsp; This is our hope.</p>\n\n<p>It is this aspect of salvation that Paul describes as our helmet.&nbsp; 1 Thessalonians 5 says, &ldquo;8 But since we are of the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having such a hope, we do not grow weary of Satan&rsquo;s attacks but persevere in doing good.&nbsp; We do not get discouraged by a lack of seeing the fruit of our efforts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consider that God commissioned Jeremiah to preach to Israel, but then told him that they would not listen to him nor would they answer him (Jeremiah 7:27).&nbsp; Yet, Jeremiah was obedient, knowing he had the hope of his salvation to which he could look forward.&nbsp; So, although Satan and his demons will attack our mind, causing us to doubt and to be discouraged, we persevere, knowing our salvation awaits us, which is the helmet of salvation.&nbsp; In that sense, we protect our mind, our thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Our final piece of armor is the &ldquo;sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Note that this is the first weapon that is not solely defensive, as are the other weapons.&nbsp; The sword can be both defensive and offensive.&nbsp; We are talking here about the Bible, God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; If this is one of our weapons, then it logically follows that in order for us to be able to use this weapon, we must understand God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; This is one reason Bible study is so crucial in the life of all believers.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting aside is that the Greek word for sword here is&nbsp;m&aacute;chaira, which is a small sword, as opposed to a much longer broadsword.&nbsp; This sword would be anywhere from 6 to 18 inches, and was used for close combat fighting.&nbsp; The picture here is one that is personal.</p>\n\n<p>We use the word of God because it is true, it is inerrant, it is infallible.&nbsp; Hebrews 4 tells us it is &ldquo;living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is powerful &ndash; it is the power of God unto salvation (Romans 1:16).&nbsp; By the word we are sanctified (John 17:17).&nbsp; The word of God is a powerful weapon indeed.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the best example of using the sword defensively is given to us by our Lord Jesus when He was tempted by Satan in the wilderness (Matthew 4, Luke 4).&nbsp; Jesus answers each of Satan&rsquo;s temptations with Scripture.&nbsp; He is thus defending Himself against temptation with the word of God.&nbsp; Likewise, we can protect ourselves from Satan&rsquo;s temptations by knowing God&rsquo;s word, just as our Lord did.</p>\n\n<p>The sword of the Spirit can also be used offensively.&nbsp; When we preach the gospel, we are attacking the dominion of Satan by bringing people out of the darkness and into His marvelous light (all by the power of the Holy Spirit).&nbsp; We can attack the elementary principles of this world when we preach the truth in love, which is typically against the views of the world (e.g., marriage, sex, drunkenness, lying, stealing, etc.)&nbsp; We use it offensively so we can &ldquo;sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence. (1 Peter 3:15)&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, as one prominent teacher pointed out, the armor is a picture of Jesus Christ our God and Savior.&nbsp; He is the truth (the belt).&nbsp; He gives us faith (the shield).&nbsp; He is our righteousness (the breastplate).&nbsp; He is our peace (the shoes).&nbsp; He is our salvation (the helmet).&nbsp; And He is the Word (the sword of the Spirit).&nbsp; To God be the glory!</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Can you explain Satan&#39;s origins and his fall? Was he created before the Garden?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe history of angels (and demons) is sparsely covered in scripture, probably because they are secondary to the purposes of God in authoring scripture. Nevertheless, we do get some details in the Bible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, we know that the Lord created the angels prior to the Creation, according to Job 38:4-7:</p>\n\n<h5>Job 38:4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tell Me, if you have understanding,&nbsp;<br />\nJob 38:5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Who set its measurements? Since you know.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Or who stretched the line on it?&nbsp;<br />\nJob 38:6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;On what were its bases sunk?&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Or who laid its cornerstone,&nbsp;<br />\nJob 38:7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When the morning stars sang together&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And all the sons of God shouted for joy?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The sons of God in v.7 refers to angels, just as it does earlier in the book of Job and in Genesis 6. The role of angels in Heaven prior to the Creation seems to be to praise the Lord singing before His throne. After the creation of man, angels fulfill their primary purpose, which is to minister to the saints:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 1:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But to which of the angels has He ever said,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET&rdquo;?&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 1:14&nbsp;Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Regarding the fall of Satan and the Creation, there is no exact timeline in scripture, though in Ezekiel 28 we learn the full story of how Satan fell prior to the Creation while he lived in Heaven:</p>\n\n<h5>Ezek. 28:12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre and say to him, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord GOD,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You had the seal of perfection,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You were in Eden, the garden of God;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Every precious stone was your covering:&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The ruby, the topaz and the diamond;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The beryl, the onyx and the jasper;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The lapis lazuli, the turquoise and the emerald;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the gold, the workmanship of your settings and sockets,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Was in you.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the day that you were created&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They were prepared.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You were the anointed cherub who covers,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And I placed you there.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You were on the holy mountain of God;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You walked in the midst of the stones of fire.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You were blameless in your ways&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From the day you were created&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Until unrighteousness was found in you.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;By the abundance of your trade&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You were internally filled with violence,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And you sinned;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore I have cast you as profane&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From the mountain of God.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And I have destroyed you, O covering cherub,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From the midst of the stones of fire.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I cast you to the ground;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I put you before kings,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;That they may see you.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;By the multitude of your iniquities,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the unrighteousness of your trade&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You profaned your sanctuaries.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore I have brought fire from the midst of you;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It has consumed you,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And I have turned you to ashes on the earth&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the eyes of all who see you.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;All who know you among the peoples&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are appalled at you;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You have become terrified&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And you will cease to be forever.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>First, the writer says Satan was an angel created by God and perfectly made.&nbsp;Notice in v.12, we hear that&nbsp;Satan had the seal of perfection.&nbsp;He was full of wisdom and beauty.&nbsp;In v.15, he was blameless, at least for a time, and he was splendidly adorned in jewels Ezekiel says.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, notice where Satan lived and how he served God, and in v.13 he was in the garden of Eden.&nbsp;Naturally, we assume this refers to the garden than Adam and&nbsp;Woman occupied, and&nbsp;of course, Satan was in the earthly garden in Genesis 3.But if we look more closely at this passage, we see clues that&nbsp;suggest this garden isn&rsquo;t the same one as&nbsp;that in Genesis 3.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, Satan was on the holy mountain of God.&nbsp;The holy mountain of God is Mt. Zion, which&nbsp;is the name for the Heaven Jerusalem that exists in the&nbsp;Heavenly realm.&nbsp;The writer of Hebrews mentions this later in his letter in chapter&nbsp;12, and&nbsp;in Revelation 21, we hear that this heavenly Zion will&nbsp;descend from Heaven to become our new&nbsp;dwelling place for&nbsp;eternity. So it would seem that there is a heavenly garden called Eden,&nbsp;which the earthly Eden represented.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, notice that Satan served God as the covering cherub.&nbsp;The covering cherub refers to those angels whose wings covered the&nbsp;mercy seat on top of the ark of the covenant. The tabernacle given to Moses and Israel is&nbsp;a pattern of the one in Heaven,&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So now we know that the golden covering cherubs made for the&nbsp;earthly tabernacle are pictures of real cherubs&nbsp;who cover the&nbsp;glory of God in the Heavenly tabernacle, and the&nbsp;first and most glorious of those cherubs originally was&nbsp;none other than Satan himself. &nbsp;Then notice in v.18 Ezekiel says that Satan profaned his sanctuaries. The word in Hebrew for sanctuary literally means holy places.&nbsp;Satan profaned the holy places.</p>\n\n<p>There are two holy places in the tabernacle, the holy place and the holy of holies. Both of these places in the Heavenly tabernacle were defiled by&nbsp;Satan Ezekiel says.&nbsp;How did Satan come to defile the Heavenly tabernacle?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, God says Satan was&nbsp;filled with violence because of pride.&nbsp;Specifically, Satan took note of the abundance of his trade.&nbsp;Trade is a term in Hebrew meaning merchandise, and in this context it refers to Satan&rsquo;s trade as the covering cherub.&nbsp;He was the angel closest to the glory of God.&nbsp;He was assigned to cover it, to husband it, and because he was so close to God&rsquo;s glory, he was&nbsp;filled with&nbsp;violence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What was supposed to be an honor to Satan became a cause for him to&nbsp;rebel against God, and he so loved seeing his privileged position next to the glory of&nbsp;God that he began to think he was equal to&nbsp;God. This is the essence of pride: loving what God has done in&nbsp;creating us so much that we stop thanking Him and&nbsp;begin thanking&nbsp;ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Satan was corrupted by his own perfection.&nbsp;Satan started thinking he was inherently great and beautiful &ndash;&nbsp;even more so than God Himself.&nbsp;Notice in v.17 Ezekiel says Satan&rsquo;s heart was corrupted by his&nbsp;splendor. What&nbsp;action did Satan take to pollute the Heavenly tabernacle? The answer to this question is a little less clear, but first&nbsp;remember Satan&rsquo;s position as the covering cherub.&nbsp;His station was in the holiest place in the tabernacle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We know the tabernacle on earth is based on a pattern of the&nbsp;tabernacle in Heaven, and we also see that other aspects of Creation are patterned&nbsp;after things in Heaven.&nbsp;The temple mount is a representation of Mt. Zion in Heaven, and&nbsp;the garden of Eden on earth appears to be a representation&nbsp;of the Garden of God in Heaven.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, to understand how Satan may have profaned the tabernacle&nbsp;in Heaven, we should ask does Satan ever&nbsp;profane the earthly tabernacle?&nbsp;The answer is most definitely, he does so on numerous occasions, but most notably in the&nbsp;Abomination of Desolation described in&nbsp;Daniel and by Jesus in&nbsp;Matthew 24.&nbsp;This is a moment when Satan sets a man in the Holy of Holies&nbsp;and declares himself to be God.&nbsp;Satan also accomplished&nbsp;something&nbsp;similar with Antiochus Epiphanies&nbsp;shortly before Christ&rsquo;s birth, and&nbsp;he will repeat it again with the Antichrist in&nbsp;Tribulation.</p>\n\n<p>So by comparison, Satan was a covering cherub who became so convinced&nbsp;by his importance and beauty&nbsp;that he could be God, and&nbsp;so in a rebellious moment of violence and pride, Satan seized the&nbsp;mercy seat in the Heavenly tabernacle&nbsp;declaring Himself to be God. In doing so, he profaned the Heavenly tabernacle.&nbsp;We see the result of that act of rebellion in Ezekiel 28.</p>\n\n<p>In v.16 the Lord says He cast Satan down from the mountain of God (in&nbsp;Heaven), and&nbsp;In v.17 we hear that Satan was cast to the ground,&nbsp;The Hebrew word for ground is the word for earth, and&nbsp;again in v.18 the Lord declares that Satan was cast down to&nbsp;the earth.&nbsp;We know that Satan fell into sin prior to the events of Genesis 3, where&nbsp;he met with woman and seduced her&nbsp;to sin.&nbsp;So it seems that Satan was roaming the earthly garden of Eden&nbsp;because he had been cast out of the&nbsp;Heavenly garden of God.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jesus described seeing this moment in the Gospels:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 10:18 &nbsp;And He said to them, &ldquo;I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.</h5>\n\n<p>This is largely the extent of what we know concerning the timeline of Satan&rsquo;s fall.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>I&#39;ve heard my pastor say we need to \"cast a vision,\" but I don&#39;t know what that means? Is it biblical for pastors to be preoccupied with arriving at a vision for the growth of a church rather than simply accomplishing the work of evangelizing, discipling, equipping?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA strategic vision (or a plan for the future) is not by itself a bad thing in any walk of life, including in serving God. God is not opposed to plans, as we see with Joseph who planned thoroughly to survive a period of famine in Egypt. Setting goals and objective in ministry can be immensely helpful to accomplish difficult and challenging tasks even as we rely on the Spirit and seek the Lord&rsquo;s counsel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The question is where do we go to find our vision and goals in ministry? In Joseph&rsquo;s case, the Lord set the vision when He told Joseph through a dream given to Pharaoh what to expect and how to respond. Then Joseph simply put God&rsquo;s vision into action through careful planning and execution, as scripture records.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, men must seek the wisdom and counsel of the Lord in His word by the counsel of His Spirit. Then when the Lord reveals His desires to our heart, we put that &ldquo;vision&rdquo; into action for the glory of Christ. Unfortunately, many churches have replaced leaning on the Lord and His word for direction with leaning on their own understanding and egotistical desires. In some cases,&nbsp;modern churched \"cast\" visions of larger and larger buildings and bank accounts&nbsp;rather than visions of dividing to&nbsp;reach&nbsp;the world for Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As you mentioned in your question, growth is an overriding preoccupation&nbsp;for many churches, while scripture emphasizes&nbsp;growing THE Church, not a specific church body. These goals may sound similar, but they are actually very different and usually opposed to one another. Growing THE church means to reach outward with the Gospel, teaching disciples to become disciple-makers, and sending them out to start the process somewhere else. This model doesn&rsquo;t grow a single church body necessarily, but it does grow THE Church!</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, we caution you against judging any pastoral staff too quickly on this question. Allow&nbsp;time to get to know their hearts and intentions. Many men in pastoral ministry have been trained in seminaries to think of pastoring a church like building a business, and, unfortunately, they may have internalized this premise without questioning its biblical legitimacy. Show these men grace and attempt to guide them into a more biblical view of how the Lord calls His Church to grow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you may find the following resources helpful on this topic.

                "body": "<p><em><strong>I am a relatively new Christian, but I have been dealing with panic attacks for many years. I have been on medications to control the attacks, but recently they are coming back. I pray to the Lord and I know the Lord is in control, but I can&#39;t seem to stop the anxiety. What should a Christian do?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThough VBVMI is&nbsp;not qualified to provide personal counseling services, we can offer some general biblical guidance for your situation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, we believe your recent relationship with Christ is a key detail in&nbsp;your situation, because when a person enters into an abiding relationship with Christ (either as a new believer or a believer who has returned from a period of rebellion or neglect), they may experience&nbsp;attacks from the enemy. The demonic realm is&nbsp;under orders&nbsp;by Satan to inhibit the walk of believers, and anxiety is a key weapon:</p>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 5:6&nbsp; Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,&nbsp;<br />\n1Pet. 5:7&nbsp;casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.&nbsp;<br />\n1Pet. 5:8&nbsp;Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice Peter reassures the believer that the Lord will exalt us only at the proper time, which means only when the Lord has determined He is ready to raise us above our circumstances. The Lord&rsquo;s timing is a matter of His purposes in growing us through trials so we may become more holy and pleasing to Him. Obviously, Peter is primarily referring to the Lord bringing us into glory in Heaven, but even now in our present circumstances the Lord calls upon believers to cast our anxieties upon the Lord.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Peter is not saying we shouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;feel&nbsp;anxiety for this would be impossible. All human begins feel anxiety to some extent. Peter is telling us not to act according to our anxiety, for when we do so we become vulnerable to the schemes of the enemy. Hebrews says that fear is a primary weapon of the enemy:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 2:14&nbsp;Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 2:15&nbsp;and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nFear leads to a form of slavery to the devil, who brings to mind fears that are no longer true for the believer.&nbsp;Notice that Peter couples his instructions concerning anxiety with a call for the believer to be of sober spirit. Sober means not under the influence of something, and in this context Peter is speaking about the debilitating influence of anxiety, worry, fear and the like. When we allow such feelings to drive our behaviors, we become victims of the enemy, who preys on anxieties to arrest our progress in walking with the Lord. In that sense, he devours us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, we know your situation is more severe, and we are not suggesting your can&nbsp;simply &ldquo;will&rdquo; your way out of your panic attacks. Still, we believe that as your&nbsp;Christian walk matures (by the washing of the word) you will become less enslaved by these fears.</p>\n\n<p>The Lord Himself will strengthen you as you grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord. In other words, devote yourself to becoming someone who knows the Lord&rsquo;s word and seeks to follow it, and leave the rest to Christ. You will undoubtedly continue to experience an attack from time to time, but we are convinced that you will see these things fade away as you obtain the mind of Christ by His word.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we recommend you seek a godly, biblical counselor who can walk with you through this time. Hopefully,&nbsp;in time your doctor may limit or eliminate your medications, as these treatments may&nbsp;be worse than the disease. Nevertheless, seek proper medical advice before taking or ending any course of treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>I&#39;m confused by what I&#39;ve seen at so-called healing services? People come forward, men pray over them, they fall to the ground and twist around in a trance, and then they claim to be healed. Is this the biblical way God brings healing?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThroughout the centuries of the church, believers experiencing illness and injury have sought supernatural healing from the Lord.<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In the Bible, we see the Lord healing individuals in the Gospel, the Apostles healing people in the book of Acts, and the writers of the New Testament epistles speaking of healing in the church. Since healing is clearly a part of the Christian experience, does the Bible prescribe a certain manner for acquiring God&#39;s healing?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The only prescription given in scripture is found in James 5:</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">:</span></p>\n\n<h6>James 5:13&nbsp; Is anyone among you&nbsp;suffering?&nbsp;Then he must pray. Is anyone cheerful? He is to&nbsp;sing praises.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 5:14&nbsp;Is anyone among you sick? Then he must call for&nbsp;the elders of the church and they are to pray over him,&nbsp;anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;&nbsp;<br />\nJames 5:15&nbsp;and the&nbsp;prayer&nbsp;offered in faith will&nbsp;restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will&nbsp;raise him up, and if he has committed sins,&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be forgiven him.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 5:16&nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be&nbsp;healed.&nbsp;The effective&nbsp;prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>In chapter 5, James was teaching the necessity for believers&nbsp;to the seek the Lord for what we desire. In James&#39; day, the church was seeking for gain in the wrong ways, and earlier in this chapter&nbsp;James admonished the church for creating strife rather than seeking the Lord in prayer. So James&#39; purpose in chapter 5 is to correct the church&#39;s attitude and instruct it to go to the Lord for its needs.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of suffering, James says we must pray for a solution. When a prayer is offered \"in faith,\" then that person can expect the Lord to restore the one who is sick. To pray \"in faith\" means to be led by the Holy Spirit into the prayer based in confidence that the Lord is preparing to accomplish the healing. In other words, praying in faith means praying with a supernatural understanding that the Lord has already determined to accomplish the healing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>When we pray in faith, we do not create the outcome by means of our prayers. Rather, we&nbsp;are announcing the Lord&#39;s intentions before He acts, based on insight give to us by the Holy Spirit. This is the manner of prayer that leads to healing, James says. Apart from this instruction, the Bible gives no other recipe for healing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Beyond elders,&nbsp;the Lord may equip a member of the body with the gift to healing supernaturally.&nbsp;In 1Corinthians 12:28 Paul lists \"healing\" as one of the spiritual gifts available in the body, therefore we must acknowledge that healing is a spiritual gift available within the body. If someone has the gift to heal, then that person may be used by the Spirit to accomplish healing from time to time, however this does not mean the person has \"magic\" powers to heal on demand.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The gift of healing operates no differently than any other spiritual gift in that the believer remains 100% dependent on the will and power of the Holy Spirit. Just as a believer with a gift to teach can&#39;t know all things in scripture perfectly, neither can someone with the gift to heal succeed in healing 100% of the time. Every spiritual gift operates dependent upon the will of God, so that only if the Lord wills to heal will a&nbsp;healing take place.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Certainly, the Lord is capable and often inclined to provide bodily healing, but there is no assurance in scripture that the Lord will&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;heal our bodies&nbsp;upon request. On the contrary, sooner or later our body must die and return to dust, unless we live until the resurrection day, but sooner or later our body will be replaced (thankfully!).&nbsp;Therefore, we cannot say that God always heals, otherwise no one would ever die!&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Instead, we must acknowledge that the Lord&nbsp;<em>may</em>&nbsp;heal us when He desires, but sooner or later He won&#39;t.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Unfortunately, there are many false teachers and deceivers within the Church seeking to fleece the Lord&#39;s flock by teaching falsely that the Lord always heals us when we ask Him. Some of these evil men call themselves \"faith healers\" claiming to have the power to heal by means of the Spirit, but only for those who have \"faith.\" Usually, these conmen&nbsp;set up shop in charismatic environments, where fervour and emotion replace&nbsp;sound doctrine and good judgment, leading many needy believers to be fooled into expecting miraculous healing on demand.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We strongly advise believers to be wary of such displays. Instead, seek godly intercession with mature, devoted elders or other members of the body with a heart to serve God in quiet humility and chaste reverence. Never agree to donate money as a quid pro quo for healing, and be content with your circumstances should the Lord decline to heal your body. Remember, all believers must shed this old body one way or another so that we may inherit the new, eternal body we are promised.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For a more thorough treatment on this subject, we recommend you listen to our </span><a href=\"/bible-studies/the_sovereignty_of_god\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Sovereignty of God</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> series (especially Lessons 3-4) and our teaching in <a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\">1Corinthians</a> (Lessons 12A &ndash; 14D)..</span></p>"

Conversely, not&nbsp;having life (i.e., death) is not having the Son, that is being an unbeliever. The Bible commonly uses the dichotomy of life and death to represent belief and&nbsp;unbelief. &nbsp;John repeats this association several times in this letter, including again in v.13 when he says that the church&#39;s belief in Christ has given them&nbsp;eternal life.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Then he teaches that believers have the confidence to approach the Lord with our petitions, and the Lord will hear us. And if the Lord hears us, John says we&nbsp;know we \"have the requests which we have asked from Him.\" This is an awkward phrase in the English reflecting a difficult Greek meaning. John is saying&nbsp;that if the Lord grants our requests, it means that our requests were according to the Lord&#39;s desires.</span></p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, when we intercede for the needs of a brother or sister who is sinning, we can have confidence that the Lord&#39;s assurance of eternal life for that believer is not in jeopardy on account of the person&#39;s sin. In other words, a believer&#39;s sin will be forgiven.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there is a sin that leads to eternal death, which is the sin of unbelief, and this sin cannot be forgiven through our intercession. We have no&nbsp;hope that the Lord will grant our petition that someone be forgiven of their sin of unbelief. The Lord cannot grant such a request.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, concerning a person committing the sin&nbsp;of unbelief, John says the Christian ought not to&nbsp;pray&nbsp;for forgiveness for that person since we know it cannot be granted. We would not be praying in the Lord&#39;s will in such a case. Instead, we should pray for the individual&nbsp;to believe so as to be saved and forgiven.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, John says that though all unrighteousness is sin, there is a difference between the sin of unbelief and the sins committed by believers. Sin in the life of a believer does not endanger our eternal life, while the sin of unbelief prevents forgiveness.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Adam and Eve had Cain and Abel. Cain killed Abel and left Eden to live in the east. Where did he get his wife,&nbsp;since Adam and Eve were the first humans on the planet and with Cain and Abel were only&nbsp;four people in total?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">A. In Genesis 2, the Bible tells how God created man and later woman on the sixth day of creation. While they lived in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Woman were the only two human beings in the world. Nevertheless, God gave these two people the command to multiply and fill the earth in Gen 1:28.</span></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Adam and Woman sinned before they could execute God&#39;s plan for reproduction. Nevertheless, the couple (now Adam and Eve) follow through on God&#39;s plan and build a family, starting with Cain and Abel.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, God&#39;s plan from the beginning was that these two people would conceive children and these children would, in turn, have their own children until the earth was filled with nations of people. God&#39;s instruction to Adam and Woman begs an obvious question: how did God expect one couple to fill the earth? To this question, the Bible offers an equally obvious (if troubling) answer: God intended Adam&#39;s children to marry one another and bear children.</p>\n\n<p>As we consider this answer, let&#39;s review some points of scripture.</p>\n\n<p>First, Adam&#39;s family included more people than simply Eve, Cain and Abel. Gen 5:4 tells us that Adam had many sons and daughters. The first son born was Cain, and soon thereafter came Abel, but that doesn&#39;t mean other siblings weren&#39;t already living at the time Cain killed Abel.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, Gen 4:14 indicates that there were other members of Adam&#39;s family already living as adults at the time that Cain killed Abel. Cain expressed concern when he learned from God that he must wander the world as his punishment for killing Abel, because he said he feared that others (i.e., other members of his family) would find him and take revenge against him (v.14).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, though the Bible only mentions four people by name at the point of Genesis 4, the full genealogy of Adam is provided in Chapter 5. The fact that Chapter 5 follows Chapter 4 sequentially in the Bible doesn&#39;t mean that many of the people listed in Genesis 5 weren&#39;t already alive&nbsp;during the events of Chapter 4. The genealogy chapters of Genesis, including Chapter 5, span long periods of time, including events described in other chapters of Genesis before or after their order in Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we know from scripture that in the early years after the fall, Adam and Eve raised a family of many children who grew to adulthood and joined together in marriage relationships to establish the next generation. By the time Cain killed Abel, there were numerous siblings living with extended families. Later, Cain married one of his sisters (4:17) as did the rest of his siblings (5:1-5).</p>\n\n<p>No answer to this question would be complete, however, unless we address the natural concern we have in hearing that God expected brothers to marry sisters.</p>\n\n<p>First, we must understand that it&#39;s clear from the circumstances described in Genesis that God intended for Adam&#39;s siblings to marry and reproduce. In fact, Adam and Woman were themselves blood relatives (Gen 2:21-22), so even the first marriage united two people who shared the same DNA. Even as late as Abraham and Isaac, the custom of marrying within one&#39;s family was still an acceptable practice (Gen 24:4).</p>\n\n<p>Later in the Law, God specifically outlawed sexual union between blood relatives (Leviticus 18). Likewise, today it is illegal in most (if not all) cultures for siblings to marry and produce children. Such unions are considered dangerous, since the children are at much higher risk of suffering from genetic diseases, and most incest laws are justified on the basis of this health concern.</p>\n\n<p>So, why would God consider marriage between siblings to be acceptable in Adam&#39;s day but later outlaw such relationships? The answer is found in the curse placed on the Earth because of Adam&#39;s sin.</p>\n\n<p>God&#39;s instructions to Adam and Woman were given while both lived in the Garden and before they had fallen into a state of sin. At that time, Adam existed as he had been created: he was perfect. His body contained no defects. In this perfect state, there would be no stigma nor health concerns over sibling marriages since every human would reproduce in perfection. It was simply the natural course established by God.</p>\n\n<p>At the point of the Fall, however, God altered the state of His creation. In response to Adam&#39;s sin, God pronounced a curse on the Earth and all that came from the Earth (Gen 3:17-19). This curse directed that everything on Earth that had life would, by necessity, die a physical death and return to dust.</p>\n\n<p>The death of living things was to take place through a process of decay: a slow, steady deterioration of God&#39;s perfect design culminating in the whole Earth and everything in it \"wearing\" out and ultimately being replaced (Isaiah 51:6; Psalms 102:25-26; Heb 1:10-12). Our bodies will be replaced at the resurrection and the world itself is replaced with the coming of the new Heavens and Earth.</p>\n\n<p>The effects of this curse have become evident in stages. Early generations of men showed little evidence of the curse in the fact that they continued to live very long natural lives, probably because the genetic defects that God ordained to produce the disease and physical frailty leading to death were far less prevalent in those early generations. Nevertheless, Adam&#39;s descendants all died eventually as the curse required (Rom 5:14), and over time the defects in human DNA multiplied generation over generation, until disease and other physical frailties caused a decreasing lifespan.</p>\n\n<p>By the time Israel left Egypt during the Exodus, the population of men and women in Israel was plentiful, eliminating the necessity for brothers to marry sisters. Furthermore, genetic defects in the population had accumulated to the point that the health risks of marrying family members were too great to permit the practice any longer. So, God outlawed it.&nbsp;</p>"

He didn&#39;t experience eternal separation from God as I would. Jesus only&nbsp;went to Hell for 3 days, so who is serving my \"life sentence\" in Hell if Jesus is now sitting at the right hand of the Father?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Jesus&#39; time in the grave was not a payment&nbsp;for our sin or the reason we avoid eternity in Hell. As the question&nbsp;points out, Jesus was dead for only three days, yet God&#39;s word decrees an eternal death (i.e., separation from God)&nbsp;for any who reject&nbsp;Christ and die&nbsp;in sin. In reality, Jesus&#39; time spent in&nbsp;the grave served an entirely different purpose in God&#39;s plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, the wording of the question&nbsp;assumes that \"spending eternity in hell\" is similar to serving time in prison for a crime. Such a comparison falls short of explaining why the unjust are sent to the Lake of Fire. To know Hell&#39;s true purpose, we must begin by&nbsp;understanding&nbsp;what Jesus&#39; death accomplished on our behalf.</p>\n\n<p>When Adam was instructed not to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, God promised that if he disobeyed, Adam would die. Later in Revelation 20:14 we learn that the death God was speaking about in Genesis&nbsp;is the \"second\" death, which is an eternity spent in the Lake of Fire. This is God&#39;s promised outcome for sin. It is not a period of restitution or \"paying off our debt.\" Rather, it is the future existence God decreed for any who disobey His word.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Scripture says that God&#39;s perfect character must display wrath against unholiness, and, therefore, our very sinful nature demands that we receive God&#39;s wrath. Men&nbsp;remain subject to His wrath for as long as they exist in sin, and those who die in their sins without placing their trust in Jesus Christ remain eternally sinful. Therefore, they remain eternally&nbsp;subject to God&#39;s wrath because the sin nature of the unbeliever follows them into the grave. They must live forever&nbsp;in Hell (and later the Lake of Fire) because there is no solution to their sin if they reject Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus Christ&nbsp;addressed both these issues on our behalf by His sinless life and sacrificial death&nbsp;on the cross. First, Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life. He had no sin of His own, scripture says. Since He lived a sinless life, Jesus did not warrant God&#39;s wrath nor did He deserve death.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, His perfect life is available for God to credit to us by faith. When we believe in the God&#39;s word, we are given Christ&#39;s righteousness. Paul expresses it&nbsp;this way:</span></p>\n\n<h6><u>Phil. 3:9</u> &nbsp; and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So, believers in Jesus Christ are made righteous by our faith. We have \"put on\" Christ, Paul says in Romans 13:14, meaning we are covered in His righteousness, which was given to us by the Father through faith in Christ. Therefore, we enter Heaven because we are righteous by faith.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Secondly, Jesus&#39;s death on the cross gave an opportunity for God&#39;s wrath to be satisfied for sin.&nbsp;Though we deserved God&#39;s wrath for our sin, Jesus took God&#39;s wrath on our behalf. His death on the cross was the moment God&#39;s wrath for sin&nbsp;was poured out on Jesus, as He became&nbsp;our&nbsp;propitiation or payment. </span></p>\n\n<h6>1John 2:2 &nbsp;and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Take note that God&#39;s wrath for sin was satisfied in the death of Christ alone. God&#39;s did not require that Jesus spend time in Hell to satisfy His wrath because as we said earlier, the&nbsp;Second Death is not a \"payment\" to satisfy God&#39;s wrath. It is the&nbsp;dwelling place assigned to those who exist in sin eternally. Since Jesus had no sin of His own, He had no reason to live in Hell (or the Lake of Fire) forever.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore,</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;believers avoid eternal death </span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><em>not</em></strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> because Jesus took our place in Hell;&nbsp;we escape that punishment&nbsp;because by our faith in Christ we become eligible to live in Heaven. Our entrance into Heaven requires both a payment for our sins&nbsp;and&nbsp;we being made righteousness. Christ accomplished both for us by His life and death.&nbsp;By Christ&#39;s sinless life,&nbsp;we have been credited with Christ&#39;s&nbsp;righteousness, and by Christ&#39;s death&nbsp;on the cross, God&#39;s wrath for our sin has been appeased.</span></p>\n\n<p>So why <em>did</em> Jesus spend three days in the grave after He died?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">First, Jesus spent three days in the grave to prove He was the Messiah, risen from the dead in fulfillment of scripture:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><u>Psa. 16:9</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore&nbsp; my heart is glad and my glory rejoices;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">My flesh also will dwell securely.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<u style=\"line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 13px;\">Psa. 16:10</u><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 13px;\"> &nbsp; For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">Nor will You allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><u>Hos. 6:1</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Come, let us return to the LORD.<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;For He has torn us, but He will heal us;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;He has wounded us, but He will bandage us.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<u style=\"line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 13px;\">Hos. 6:2</u><span style=\"line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 13px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;He will revive us after two days;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 13px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;He will raise us up on the third day,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 13px;\">That we may live before Him.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><u>Matt. 12:38</u> &nbsp;Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher,&nbsp; we want to see a&nbsp; sign from You.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><u>Matt. 12:39</u> &nbsp;But He answered and said to them, &ldquo; An evil and adulterous generation craves for a&nbsp; sign; and yet no&nbsp; sign will be given to it but the&nbsp; sign of Jonah the prophet;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><u>Matt. 12:40</u> &nbsp;for just as&nbsp; JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so will&nbsp; the Son of Man be&nbsp; three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Jesus remain dead for three days to fulfill scripture and to demonstrate He was the Messiah. The three-day period Jesus spent in the grave precluded anyone charging Jesus \"faked\" His death.&nbsp;Three days was enough time to establish beyond any doubt that Jesus was truly dead so that when He resurrected, everyone could know He kept His promise to abolish death.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Jesus used His time in the grave to preach to those in Sheol, the holding place of the dead prior to the resurrection. Sheol is two parts: Abraham&#39;s Bosom and Hades. You can read about these two places in Luke 16.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Christ&#39;s death and resurrection,<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Old Testament saints (i.e.,&nbsp;believers ) who died were unable to enter Heaven.&nbsp;Though they were righteous by their faith even before Christ&#39;s death on the cross (e.g., Romans 4:9), until Jesus blood was spilled,&nbsp;God&#39;s&nbsp;wrath had not been satisfied. Therefore, the Lord made a place of comfort for OT saints to wait until the Lord&#39;s coming.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">After His death, Jesus descended into Sheol, to Abraham&#39;s Bosom, which is the side of Sheol reserved for the saints. It is not a place or torment. Jesus never experienced \"Hell\" or torment during the time He was in the grave. Instead,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Peter says that Jesus used the three days in the grave to \"preach\" to the Old Testament saints and to the unbelievers held in the other side of Sheol, Hades, which is a prison for unbelivers as they await their judgment day:</span></p>\n\n<h6><u>1Pet. 3:18</u> &nbsp;For Christ also died for sins&nbsp; once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might&nbsp; bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><u>1Pet. 3:19</u> &nbsp;in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Jesus&#39; preaching served two purposes. First, Jesus introduced Himself to the those Whe He came to rescue. Remember, they were saved by their faith in God&#39;s promises, but they lacked a full understanding of Who the Messiah would be. They waited for the Lord to reveal the Messiah, and now as they waited with Jesus for the third day, they had a private audience with Jesus to understand how He fulfilled all prophecy.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Jesus preached <em>against</em> the unbelievers in Hades. His appearance was not intended to give a \"second\" opportunity to those in Hades, but rather Jesus spoke against them, confirming them in their sins and convicting them.</p>\n\n<p>After the three days were complete, Jesus ascended from Sheol, resurrected as the First Fruits of the resurrection,&nbsp;and then escorted&nbsp;the souls of those waiting for Him in Abraham&#39;s Bosom to Heaven. As Paul writes:</p>\n\n<h6><u>Eph. 4:8</u>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore it says,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 13px;\"><u>Eph. 4:9</u> &nbsp;(Now this expression,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.2em; font-size: 13px;\">&ldquo;He ascended,&rdquo; what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>So in summary, the Bible teaches that Jesus&#39; sinless life becomes ours by faith, leading us to be declared righteous and able to enter Heaven. Jesus&#39; death satisfied God&#39;s wrath for our sin. Therefore, Jesus&#39; three days in the grave was not a part of His payment for our sin. Rather, He was in the grave&nbsp;three days for two reasons: to fulfill scripture concerning Himself in demonstrating&nbsp;He was truly dead, and to set free the OT saints awaiting Jesus&#39; death and resurrection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>What is fasting, and why do people fast in the Bible?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">To fast simply means to abstain from something for a period of time. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Fasting in the Bible generally involve abstaining from all food and drink for a period of a few days or even a week or longer. Some fasts in the Bible lasted as long as 40 days (e.g., Jesus&rsquo; 40 days of fasting in the wilderness), though long fasts included drinking water, since the human body cannot live longer than a week without water.</span></p>\n\n<p>It has become fashionable in recent decades for Christians to engage in lessor forms of fasting (i.e., juice fasts, single meal fasts, etc.), but these practices are not fasts in keeping with the model given in scripture. A scriptural fast involves a complete denial of the flesh (i.e., abstaining from all food and perhaps all drink), thereby triggering a&nbsp;struggle between the will and the flesh. It&rsquo;s in this struggle that we obtain the spiritual benefit of fasting.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Bible commonly pairs fasting with praying as essential disciplines of the faith, and w</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">hile most Christians understand the necessity and importance of prayer,&nbsp;fasting has fallen out of favor among many Christians today.&nbsp;N</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">evertheless, fasting remains a very important part of a healthy Christian walk, and </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">when we practice fasting as intended, we gain a number of spiritual benefits. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Consider these examples of fasting from scripture:&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h6>Neh. 1:4&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard these words,&nbsp;I sat down&nbsp;and&nbsp;wept&nbsp;and&nbsp;mourned for days;&nbsp;and&nbsp;I was&nbsp;fasting and praying&nbsp;before&nbsp;the God of&nbsp;heaven.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Psa. 35:13&nbsp;&nbsp;But as for me,&nbsp;when they were sick, my&nbsp;clothing was sackcloth;&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;humbled my soul with&nbsp;fasting,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And&nbsp;my&nbsp;prayer&nbsp;kept returning to my bosom.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><br />\nDan. 9:3&nbsp; So I&nbsp;gave my attention to the Lord God to seek Him&nbsp;by&nbsp;prayer and&nbsp;supplications, with&nbsp;fasting, sackcloth&nbsp;and&nbsp;ashes.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 17:21&nbsp; [&ldquo;But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.&rdquo;]</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Luke 2:37 and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Luke 5:33&nbsp; And they said to Him, &ldquo;The disciples of John often fast and offer prayers, the disciples of the Pharisees also do the same, but Yours eat and drink.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 5:34&nbsp; And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;You cannot make the&nbsp; attendants of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?<br />\nLuke 5:35 &ldquo;But the days will come; and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Acts 13:2 While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, &ldquo;Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&rdquo;<br />\nActs 13:3 Then, when they had fasted and&nbsp; prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">There are numerous spiritual benefits associated with the practice of fasting, and each of the scriptures quoted above reflects one of those&nbsp;spiritual purposes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">First, in Nehemiah 1:4 we see fasting associated with an appeal before the Lord, as Nehemiah was appealing for satisfaction from God over a distressing situation in Israel. Fasting is a denial of joy and satisfaction to the physical body, and&nbsp;Nehemiah denied himself&nbsp;to demonstrate to the Lord that&nbsp;he was determined to find no satisfaction apart from God&rsquo;s mercy in his situation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Nehemiah wasn&rsquo;t attempting to earn God&rsquo;s favor through his self-denial; he was demonstrating his faith and reliance on the Lord.&nbsp;Just as Abraham acted out&nbsp;of faith to sacrifice his son,&nbsp;Isaac, believing in God&rsquo;s ability to resurrect, so was&nbsp;Nehemiah showing by his&nbsp;fasting that he trusted the Lord would relieve his anguish provided he sought relief nowhere else - not&nbsp;even relief from his hunger.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Secondly, in Psalms 35, the psalmist says that he humbled his soul by fasting. Fasting is a means of humbling oneself before God because it cleverly exposes our battle with our flesh. During a period of fasting, we experience the&nbsp;flesh&rsquo;s power to control our will. Though we have declared an intention to abstain from food, nevertheless our body continually wars with our&nbsp;will trying to break our commitment to fast. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This battle with the flesh reveals how powerful the flesh can be, and through this experience we learn humility to resist the flesh&#39;s desires.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As the battle intensifies during longer&nbsp;periods&nbsp;of fasting, we gain a deeper understanding&nbsp;for the strength of our flesh and the&nbsp;weakness of our will, and we become better at winning that battle. This is the fleshly struggle Paul&nbsp;describes in Romans 7.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>As we learn how to win this battle over our flesh, we are&nbsp;humbling&nbsp;ourselves before the Lord. A&nbsp;humble heart pleases the Lord, as it demonstrates self-awareness of our sin and our unworthiness before the Lord. The Lord is pleased to bless those who demonstrate such humility, and we will naturally become more pleasing to God as we learn how to triumph over the desires of the flesh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly in Daniel 9, Daniel says his attention was directed toward the Lord through a period of fasting. Fasting interrupts our normal routine in a dramatic fashion. When our body is denied the food it expects, our minds are continually reminded of the spiritual reason we are engaged in this ordeal, and in that way our thoughts return to the Lord. As our&nbsp;thoughts return to our relationship with the Lord and our need for His mercy, we enter into a moment of prayer and thus fasting has the effect of bringing us back to God in a regular way.</p>\n\n<p>Fourthly in Matthew 17, the Lord tells the disciples that certain problems in life (e.g., casting out demons from a mute man), are only solvable through prayer and fasting.&nbsp;Notice Jesus says that the solution the disciples were seeking could only come in this way, which means the Lord will not grant relief under&nbsp;lesser circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>As Jesus taught, the Lord has reserved for Himself the power to address certain challenges in life, and when we encounter such circumstances,&nbsp;we must be willing to&nbsp;acknowledge His authority and power before He will act on our behalf. Fasting and prayer are acts of faith that acknowledge&nbsp;God&#39;s sovereign control over our lives and circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth,&nbsp;in Luke 2 we read about the widow who served God in the temple through many years of fasting and prayer in anticipation of the Lord&rsquo;s arrival. From this example, we learn that fasting is a form of spiritual service to God. Paul says:</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 12:1&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp;I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to&nbsp;present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice,&nbsp;acceptable to God, which is your&nbsp;&nbsp;spiritual service of worship.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Just as the saints of the Old Testament presented sacrifices of animals before the Lord, so is the Christian to present sacrifices today. Our sacrifices take a very different form, however, for we are called to present <em>our bodies</em>&nbsp;sacrificially,&nbsp;Paul says. Fasting is a form of sacrifice to the Lord, where we voluntarily deny ourselves something of value (i.e., food) in thanks for&nbsp;the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, kindness and provision.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Fasting doesn&#39;t&nbsp;obtain or earn&nbsp;the Lord&rsquo;s kindness (i.e., it is not a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo\">quid pro quo</a>). Rather,&nbsp;our fast is a thanks offering to&nbsp;the Lord through our bodies. We cannot give the Lord anything He doesn&rsquo;t already own, so our gifts of thanks to Him must take the form of personal sacrifice (i.e., a denial of self) rather than an enrichment of God. In&nbsp;this sense, fasting can be a simple yet powerful way to extend a blessing of thanks to the Lord through sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>Sixth, in Luke 5 the Pharisee criticized Jesus&rsquo; disciples for not fasting, when it was customary for students of all rabbis to fast regularly. Jesus answered the critic by saying so long as He remained on earth, His disciples had no reason to fast, but once He departed, then the&nbsp;disciples would fast regularly.</p>\n\n<p>In this exchange, we find&nbsp;yet another spiritual purpose in fasting. Fasting serves as a reminder&nbsp;that our life lived on earth apart from Christ will be one of trials and persecution and even sorrow. While our lives also include moments of joy,&nbsp;we must await the Lord&#39;s return and His kingdom before we will know true, eternal joy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the New Testament continually reminds the believer not to become content with the joy of&nbsp;this world, knowing the world and all it contains&nbsp;is destined to burn up. For example,&nbsp;we&rsquo;re told believers&nbsp;are not of the world (John 15:19), we are wanderers in a land that is not ours (Heb 11:13), and we should not store up our treasure on earth (Matt 6:19).</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, our flesh enjoys the lusts of life, so we need regular reminders that the pleasures of this life are not to be confused with the joy that comes in Christ alone. S<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">aints are called to fast regularly as a reminder and acknowledgement of the deprivation and wanting that accompanies our&nbsp;time of separation from Christ.&nbsp;In a future day, when we are in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we will know true joy&nbsp;in the Kingdom, and then all fasting will cease.</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, in Acts 13 we see the apostles fasting and praying before making an important decision to anoint two new leaders in the church. As we consider any course of action, our own selfish thoughts and desires will compete for our attention&nbsp;with the Lord&rsquo;s counsel through the Holy Spirit and His word. Our fleshly \"counselors\" operate out of fleshly desires, like pride, lust and greed, but the Lord&rsquo;s counsel comes from the Spirit. Our fleshly voices will always oppose the counsel of the Lord.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we must find ways to silence our fleshly voices&nbsp;so we can hear clearly from the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;Through a discipline of regular fasting, we become practiced at quieting the flesh&nbsp;and amplifying the Spirit&rsquo;s voice, leading to better understanding of the Lord&rsquo;s will in our life.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the Bible gives us numerous, compelling reasons to engage in regular fasting as part of healthy Christian discipline.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>In Matthew 12, Jesus said that blaspheming the Holy Spirit was an unforgivable sin. What exactly is blaspheming the Holy Spirit and who can commit this sin? Also,&nbsp;Jesus says this sin will not be forgiven \"in&nbsp;this world or in the world to come.\" What did He mean?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe sin of blaspheming the Holy Spirit is a sin that could only be committed in the time of Jesus&rsquo; first coming. It is not a sin that a Christian can commit today. This sin has occurred only once in history, as recorded&nbsp;in Matthew 12:</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 12:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a&nbsp;demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.&nbsp;</span><br />\nMatt. 12:23&nbsp;&nbsp; All the crowds were amazed, and were saying, &ldquo;This man cannot be the&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of David, can he?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 12:24&nbsp;&nbsp; But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, &ldquo;This man&nbsp;&nbsp;casts out demons only by&nbsp;&nbsp;Beelzebul the ruler of the demons.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 12:25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;knowing their thoughts Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and&nbsp;&nbsp;any city or house divided against itself will not stand.<br />\nMatt. 12:26&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If&nbsp;Satan casts out Satan, he&nbsp;&nbsp;is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?<br />\nMatt. 12:27&nbsp; &ldquo;If I&nbsp;by&nbsp;Beelzebul cast out demons,&nbsp;by whom do your sons cast them out? For this reason they will be your judges.<br />\nMatt. 12:28&nbsp; &ldquo;But&nbsp;if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.<br />\nMatt. 12:29&nbsp; &ldquo;Or how can anyone enter the strong man&rsquo;s house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.<br />\nMatt. 12:30&nbsp; &ldquo;He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters.<br />\nMatt. 12:31&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.<br />\nMatt. 12:32&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever&nbsp;speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever&nbsp;speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in&nbsp;this age or in the age to come.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In this scene, Jesus performed an important miracle. He healed a mute man possessed by a demon. In Jewish tradition and teaching, the Messiah was said to be recognizable on the basis of three unique miracles only He could perform. The three \"Messianic miracles\" were healing&nbsp;a leper, healing a man born blind and casting out a demon&nbsp;from a mute man. In Matthew 12 we see Jesus performing the third&nbsp;of these three Messianic miracles.</span></p>\n\n<p>Why is casting out a demon from a mute man considered proof of the Messiah? The answer comes from an understanding of how Jewish rabbis performed exorcisms in Jesus&#39; day.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Casting out of demons (exorcisms) were commonly performed in Israel by rabbis and priests. (We can see evidence that exorcism was practiced in the first century in the story found in Acts 19 of the seven sons of the Jewish priest,&nbsp;Sceva.) </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Jewish manner of casting out demons could</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;only be accomplished through a very specific ritual handed down&nbsp;by tradition (and presumably originating in divine revelation). Specifically, to cast out a demon, the priest&nbsp;had to call the demon out by name. So,&nbsp;in order to cast out a demon, the priest had to learn&nbsp;the demon&#39;s name.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">To learn the name of the demon, the priest would inquire of the demon, and t</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">he demon would&nbsp;answer by speaking using the voice of the human body it inhabited. Once a priest knew the demon&rsquo;s name, he then could perform the exorcism by casting out the demon by name. Jesus followed this same procedure at times, as&nbsp;we see in another account in Luke:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Luke 8:26 &nbsp;Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 8:27 &nbsp;And when He came out onto the land, He was met by a man from the city who was possessed with demons; and who had not put on any clothing for a long time, and was not living in a house, but in the tombs.&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 8:28 &nbsp;Seeing Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him, and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 8:29 &nbsp;For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, and yet he would break his bonds and be driven by the demon into the desert.&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 8:30 &nbsp;And Jesus asked him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Legion&rdquo;; for many demons had entered him.&nbsp;<br />\nLuke 8:31 &nbsp;They were imploring Him not to command them to go away into&nbsp;&nbsp;the abyss.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Jesus asked the name of the demon horde, and they responding with the name &ldquo;Legion.&rdquo; Jesus then proceeded in casting out the entire group. This was the only process of exorcism known to men in Israel, and the key to the process was learning the demon&rsquo;s name.</span></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if a&nbsp;possessed person was&nbsp;mute (i.e., unable to speak),&nbsp;then an exorcism was impossible. Without the ability to learn the demon&rsquo;s name, a priest would be unable to perform the exorcism as prescribed. As a result of this limitation, a teaching&nbsp;arose among religious leaders in Israel that only the true Messiah could cast out a demon&nbsp;from a mute person.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We see this tradition reflected in another story of demon possession found in Mark&rsquo;s Gospel:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Mark 9:17 &nbsp;And one of the crowd answered Him, &ldquo;Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute;&nbsp;<br />\nMark 9:18 &nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;whenever it seizes him, it&nbsp;&nbsp;slams him to the ground and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth and&nbsp;&nbsp;stiffens out. I told Your disciples to cast it out,&nbsp;and they could not do it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMark 9:19 &nbsp;And He answered them and said, &ldquo;O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!&rdquo;<br />\nMark 9:20&nbsp;They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling around and foaming at the mouth.<br />\nMark 9:21 &nbsp;And He asked his father, &ldquo;How long has this been happening to him?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;From childhood.&nbsp;<br />\nMark 9:22 &nbsp;&ldquo;It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMark 9:23 &nbsp;And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;&lsquo;If You can?&rsquo;&nbsp;All things are possible to him who believes.&rdquo;<br />\nMark 9:24 &nbsp;Immediately the boy&rsquo;s father cried out and said, &ldquo;I do believe; help my unbelief.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMark 9:25 &nbsp;When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, &ldquo;You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him and do not enter him again.&rdquo;<br />\nMark 9:26 &nbsp;After crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out; and the boy became so much like a corpse that most of them said, &ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMark 9:27 &nbsp;But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he got up.&nbsp;<br />\nMark 9:28 &nbsp;When He came into the house, His disciples began questioning Him privately, &ldquo;Why could we not drive it out?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMark 9:29 &nbsp;And He said to them, &ldquo;This kind cannot come out by anything but prayer.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Jesus encountered&nbsp;a young boy possessed by a demon. As we read, the demon had rendered the boy mute, which is the&nbsp;key detail in this story. The boy&rsquo;s father is especially troubled, because he knows that no ordinary man&nbsp;could heal his son in his mute condition. Since no man can learn the name of the demon, there is no hope for an exorcism. As we see, the disciples attempted to cast out the demon, but failed because they could not obtain the demon&rsquo;s name.</span></p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the father brought his son to Jesus for healing, probably because the father knew&nbsp;Jesus was the Messiah, and therefore he expected that Jesus could&nbsp;overcome this barrier. When Jesus remarked, &ldquo;O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you?&rdquo; He was referring to His&nbsp;disciples, who had tried in vain to cast out the demon. If His disciples truly understood Jesus was the Messiah, they would have known to bring the boy to Him instead of tryhing perform&nbsp;a feat reserved only for the Messiah. Jesus was highlighting their continuing&nbsp;unbelief in His Messiahship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">After&nbsp;Jesus finished healing the boy, His&nbsp;disciples questioned Him as to why He was able to perform this miracle yet&nbsp;they could not. Jesus answered&nbsp;by saying this &ldquo;kind&rdquo; of demon possession only comes out with prayer and fasting. In other words, only God can remove a demon from a mute body, which is why this miracle is a sign of the Messiah. Therefore, the disciples&rsquo; only recourse was to appeal to God through prayer and fasting for a deliverance.</span></p>\n\n<p>With that background, we return&nbsp;to our passage in Matthew to&nbsp;find Jesus casting out another mute demon. After Jesus heals the man, the Jewish crowd correctly realizes&nbsp;they just witnessed one of the Messianic miracles.&nbsp;Notice in Matt 12:23 the crowd exclaims, \"This man <em>cannot</em> be the&nbsp;Son of David, can he?&rdquo; The term&nbsp;&ldquo;son of David&rdquo; is a Messianic term, so the crowd is asking themselves if it is true that Jesus is their long-awaited Messiah. By the tone of their question, we can see they doubted in their own conclusion, because Jesus did not fulfill their expectations for who would be&nbsp;the Messiah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So the crowd waited for their&nbsp;religious leaders, the Pharisees, to rule on their question. Was Jesus truly the Messiah as the miracle indicated?&nbsp;Rather than acknowledging the obvious and declaring Jesus to be the Messiah, the hard-hearted Pharisees concocted&nbsp;an alternative answer to explain away Jesus&#39;&nbsp;extraordinary miracle. In v.24 they attribute His miracle to the power of Satan (Beelzebul). Their explanation was illogical and absurd, as Jesus&rsquo; rebuke points out in vs.25-30.</span></p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the people in&nbsp;the crowd agreed&nbsp;with the Pharisees&#39; assessment. Rather than accepting Jesus as their Messiah, the crowd followed the lies&nbsp;of their religious leaders, choosing to believe&nbsp;Jesus was acting with&nbsp;the power of Satan. Their decision to attribute Jesus&#39; miraculous power to Satan instead of to the Holy Spirit is the sin of blaspheming the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>The people of Israel&nbsp;witnessed the power of the Holy Spirit&nbsp;working to confirm Jesus as Messiah, and even though they correctly declared it to be a&nbsp;sign of the Messiah, they blasphemed the Holy Spirit by declaring the miracle was&nbsp;the work of Satan. In a sense, they were confessing that Satan was lord, rather than confessing Jesus as Lord.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This is an unforgivable sin, according to Jesus.</span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Just the sin of unbelief?<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">A common (mis)interpretation of the unpardonable sin suggests that J</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">esus was speaking merely about the sin of unbelief (i.e.,&nbsp;dying without accepting&nbsp;Christ as Lord), but the context of Jesus&#39; words and the related scriptures&nbsp;leads us to reject this interpretation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>First, Jesus called this special sin \"blaspheming the Holy Spirit,\" and He&nbsp;assigned it an unique penalty unlike any other&nbsp;sin:</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 12:31&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.</span><br />\nMatt. 12:32&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;Whoever&nbsp;speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever&nbsp;speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him,&nbsp;either in&nbsp;this age or in the age to come.</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Notice Jesus says that speaking against Christ is forgivable, while blaspheming the Holy Spirit is <em>not</em>&nbsp;forgivable. Rejecting the Gospel is a rejection of Christ, yet Jesus specifically says this sin can be&nbsp;forgiven. On the other hand,&nbsp;blaspheming the Holy Spirit offers no&nbsp;possibility of forgiveness,&nbsp;&ldquo;...either in&nbsp;this age or in the age to come&rdquo; Jesus says. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The word <em>age</em> refers to our present time on earth, while the \"age to come\" refers to the eternal age. Jesus says that once the unforgivable sins occurs, there can be no forgiveness in&nbsp;this age. In other words, once this sin occurs, a person is precluded from forgiveness <em>even while they still live in the present age.</em>&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Based on this penalty, we know Jesus cannot be speaking about rejecting&nbsp;Christ. If someone rejects Christ&nbsp;today, that person can&nbsp;still receive forgiveness at a later point in this age&nbsp;should the person accept&nbsp;the Gospel on a future day. A person who rejects Christ a million times is still eligible for forgiveness &ldquo;in this age&rdquo; until they die.&nbsp;This fact explains why&nbsp;Jesus says speaking \"against the Son\" is forgivable in this age. Rejecting Christ&nbsp;can be forgiven in this age, so long as the person repents&nbsp;before the age is over (i.e., before death).</span></p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, blaspheming the Holy Spirit offers no such second chance.&nbsp;Jesus says that when the unforgivable sin is committed, it shall not be forgiven <em>in this age</em>. When this sin is committed, it eliminates all&nbsp;future opportunity for forgiveness even while a person is still alive. There is no second chance for those who commit this particular sin.&nbsp;This unique penalty means Jesus was speaking&nbsp;about something very different than merely rejecting the Gospel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jesus was speaking about the unique circumstances Israel encountered when they rejected Christ face-to-face.&nbsp;Israel committed the unpardonable sin, and therefore that&nbsp;entire generation of Israel received a special judgment - a judgment that only that generation could experience. Their penalty was disqualification&nbsp;from receiving the Kingdom. Instead of receiving the Kingdom, that generation was excluded forever from God&#39;s forgiveness, leaving only a remnant of Israel to know Christ and receive the Kingdom. The rest of Israel was hardened, according to Paul:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 11:7 &nbsp;What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 11:8&nbsp; just as it is written,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 11:9&nbsp; &nbsp;And David says,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 11:10 &nbsp;&ldquo;LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 13px;\">A few verses later in Matt 12, Jesus revealed this judgment upon this generation of Israel because they committed the unforgivable sin:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 12:39 &nbsp;But He answered and said to them, &ldquo;An evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign; and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet;<br />\nMatt. 12:40 &nbsp;for just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<br />\nMatt. 12:41&nbsp;&ldquo;The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment, and will condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold,&nbsp;&nbsp;something greater than Jonah is here.<br />\nMatt. 12:42 &nbsp;&ldquo;The Queen of the South will rise up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">That generation of Israel was condemned for the remainder of their earthly lives and into&nbsp;eternity, Jesus declares. No second chances. No reprieve. Not in this age nor the next. And notice the reason Jesus gives for why&nbsp;this generation&#39;s&nbsp;unbelief was unforgivable when past generations of Israel <em>were</em> permitted to repent and&nbsp;<em>did</em> receive forgiveness for their unbelief:&nbsp;because this time &ldquo;something greater is here.&rdquo; </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In other words, Jesus says that&nbsp;because&nbsp;this&nbsp;generation of Israel saw the Messiah in person, they could not be forgiven for rejecting Him. A person&nbsp;can be forgiven&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">through repentance and faith&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">for rejecting lessor&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">messengers who declare the Gospel (i.e., the apostles, evangelists, prophets, etc.)</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">, but there is</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;no second chance for a person who rejects Jesus to His face. By blaspheming the Holy Spirit in the physical presence of the Messiah, Israel</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;committed a unique sin that could not be forgiven that generation.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We can see even more confirmation of this unique and pivotal moment in Israel&rsquo;s history by noticing how Jesus&rsquo; teaching changed immediately after Israel committed the unpardonable sin. Prior to the unpardonable sin (in Matt 1-12), Jesus&nbsp;never taught a single parable. Everything He taught was in the open for all to hear and understand.</span></p>\n\n<p>But after Israel committed the unpardonable sin in Matt 12, Jesus changed His teaching style dramatically. From Matthew 13 until His death on the cross,&nbsp;Jesus only taught in parables. After the unpardonable sin, Jesus begins hiding the truth from Israel, because Israel is no longer permitted to understand it, because they cannot be forgiven.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Even the disciples noticed Jesus&#39; abrupt change in style, so they ask Jesus in Matthew 13 why He has suddenly begun to teach in parables. Look at what Jesus says in response:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 13:10&nbsp; And the disciples came and said to Him, &ldquo;Why do You speak to them in parables?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 13:11&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus answered them, &ldquo;To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.<br />\nMatt. 13:12 &nbsp;&ldquo;For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.<br />\nMatt. 13:13 &nbsp;&ldquo;Therefore I speak to them in parables; because while seeing they do not see, and while hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.<br />\nMatt. 13:14 &nbsp;&ldquo;In their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lsquo;YOU WILL KEEP ON HEARING, BUT WILL NOT UNDERSTAND;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;YOU WILL KEEP ON SEEING, BUT WILL NOT PERCEIVE;<br />\nMatt. 13:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE HAS BECOME DULL,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;WITH THEIR EARS THEY SCARCELY HEAR,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND THEY HAVE CLOSED THEIR EYES,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OTHERWISE THEY WOULD SEE WITH THEIR EYES,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HEAR WITH THEIR EARS,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AND UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR HEART AND RETURN,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AND I WOULD HEAL THEM.&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 13:16 &nbsp;&ldquo;But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nJesus says that only a few in Israel (the remnant) would be permitted from this point forward to know the truth. Just as the OT prophets foretold, Israel would not be permitted to understand the truth of the Messiah as a judgment against them. Notice in Matt 13:15, Isaiah declared that God has closed Israel&#39;s eyes and ears&nbsp;so that they could not hear or understand. In other words, their sin would not be forgiven in this age.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Finally, we see even more confirmation that Israel&rsquo;s sin was unforgivable in another passage:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Luke 13:34&nbsp;&ldquo;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together,&nbsp;&nbsp;just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not have it!<br />\nLuke 13:35&nbsp;&ldquo;Behold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, &lsquo;&nbsp;BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!&rsquo;&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Here Jesus pronounce Israel&#39;s final judgment for unbelief. Notice Jesus says Israel&rsquo;s &ldquo;house&rdquo; is left to them desolate (from that point forward). This moment occurred only shortly after the events in Matt 12, so&nbsp;Jesus made this declaration long before He was crucified and long before the Romans destroyed the city.&nbsp;He pronounced&nbsp;Israel&#39;s judgment here&nbsp;in Luke 13 while there was yet still&nbsp;time for the nation to receive Him as Messiah.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Why did Jesus declare judgment upon&nbsp;Israel for unbelief at such an early point in His earthly ministry?&nbsp;Because Israel&#39;s die was cast once they committed&nbsp;the unforgivable sin. There could be no forgiveness \"in this age\" (as Jesus said)&nbsp;for the unforgivable sin, so from this point onward,&nbsp;this generation of Israel&nbsp;was under judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p>Notice also Jesus declares that Israel will not see their Messiah and the Kingdom &ldquo;until\" a future generation of Israel reverses the sin of this generation by declaring Jesus to be Lord. A future generation of Israel must reverse the sin of this generation by confessing that Jesus is Messiah, and when the nation follows suit, then (and only then) Jesus will return to set up the promised Kingdom. In other words, the Lord&rsquo;s Second Coming hinges on the entire nation of Israel declaring &ldquo;Blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord\" (i.e., declaring that Jesus is Messiah).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Israel will finally meet these terms on the last day of Tribulation (according to Zech 12-14), resulting in the return of Christ:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Zech. 12:9&nbsp;&ldquo;And in that day I will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.&nbsp;<br />\nZech. 12:10&nbsp; &ldquo;I will&nbsp;&nbsp;pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem,&nbsp;the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have&nbsp;&nbsp;pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one&nbsp;&nbsp;mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.&nbsp;<br />\nZech. 12:11&nbsp;&ldquo;In that day there will be great&nbsp;&nbsp;mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the&nbsp;plain of&nbsp;&nbsp;Megiddo.&nbsp;<br />\nZech. 12:12&nbsp;&ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves;&nbsp;<br />\nZech. 12:13&nbsp;the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves;&nbsp;<br />\nZech. 12:14&nbsp;all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Zech. 14:2&nbsp;For I will&nbsp;&nbsp;gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the&nbsp;&nbsp;houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.&nbsp;</span><br />\nZech. 14:3&nbsp;Then the LORD will go forth and&nbsp;&nbsp;fight against those nations, as&nbsp;&nbsp;when He fights on a day of battle.&nbsp;<br />\nZech. 14:4&nbsp;In that day His feet will&nbsp;&nbsp;stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be&nbsp;&nbsp;split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">When the Lord pours out His Spirit on Israel at the end of Tribulation, the nation will respond with a mass confession of faith in Christ. Once all Israel has made this declaration, then Christ will return to defeat the antichrist and set up the Kingdom for Israel (as He promised in Luke 13). </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So the unpardonable sin is closely related to the Second Coming of Christ. It&rsquo;s no &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; rejection of the Gospel. It is the very reason Jesus left the earth the first time!&nbsp;</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Should we have a problem with woman pastors in the church? I understand that men have authority in the church, and I know there are no woman pastors mentioned in the Bible, but I don&#39;t see much difference between woman pastors and woman evangelists.&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. First, some background on leadership in the church is important to answering this question, so we recommend you familiarize yourself with our article entitled \"<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/presbuteros_episkopos_diakonos/\">Presbuteros, Episkopos, Diakonos</a></strong>\" explaining the differences between the various church leadership roles of elders, overseers, and deacons.</p>\n\n<p>Having read our article, you should now understand that the Bible provides for two levels of leadership in the church: one focused on teaching and governing (called elders, bishops or overseers) and a second group focused on service (deacons). Deacons are always under the authority of the elders.</p>\n\n<p>The qualifications for elders and deacons are given in 1Tim 3. Looking more closely at the passage from 1Tim 3, we find interesting distinctions between Paul&#39;s criteria for elders versus his criteria for deacons.</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 3:1&nbsp; It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do.<br />\n1Tim. 3:2&nbsp; An overseer, then, must be above reproach,&nbsp; the husband of one wife,&nbsp; temperate, prudent, respectable,&nbsp; hospitable,&nbsp; able to teach,<br />\n1Tim. 3:3&nbsp; not addicted to wine&nbsp; or pugnacious, but gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money.<br />\n1Tim. 3:4 He must be one who&nbsp; manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity<br />\n1Tim. 3:5 (but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of&nbsp; the church of God?),<br />\n1Tim. 3:6 and not a new convert, so that he will not become&nbsp; conceited and fall into the&nbsp; condemnation&nbsp; incurred by the devil.<br />\n1Tim. 3:7 And he must&nbsp; have a good reputation with&nbsp; those outside the church, so that he will not fall into reproach and&nbsp; the snare of the devil.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nFirst, elders are described as men exclusively. Notice Paul&#39;s consistent use of the male pronoun in describing elders, together with mentions of \"husband\" and managing a household, which was the exclusive role of men in Paul&#39;s day. Furthermore, Paul makes no mention of women whatsoever. Finally, Paul teaches elsewhere in the New Testament that women are not permitted to teach a man or hold authority over a man.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, a woman may never serve as a leader over the church. Should a church elevate a woman into a role of elder or overseer, the church is in disobedience to the word of God.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Paul&#39;s criteria for deacons is markedly different:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 3:8&nbsp;&nbsp; Deacons likewise must be men of dignity, not double-tongued, or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain,<br />\n1Tim. 3:9&nbsp; but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.<br />\n1Tim. 3:10&nbsp; These men must also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach.<br />\n1Tim. 3:11&nbsp; Women must likewise be dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things.<br />\n1Tim. 3:12&nbsp; Deacons must be&nbsp; husbands of only one wife, and good managers of their children and their own households.<br />\n1Tim. 3:13 For those who have served well as deacons&nbsp; obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nPaul&#39;s description of deacons begins with male pronouns and a specific reference to men (e.g., v.10), but then Paul switches to describing qualifications for women in v.11. Then in v.12, Paul returns to discussing the men. Paul&#39;s inclusion of women in this passage is clear evidence that Paul anticipated women serving as deacons in the church. Since deacons are under the authority of elders/overseers (who are always men), then it makes sense Paul allowed female deacons. Woman deacons would still fall under male authority in the church.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Bible gives us evidence that women served as deacons (called deaconess) in the early church. For example, Paul mentions a deaconess in his letter to Rome:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 16:1&nbsp; I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea;<br />\nRom. 16:2 &nbsp;that you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and that you help her in whatever matter she may have need of you; for she herself has also been a helper of many, and of myself as well.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Greek word for servant in v.1 is <em>diakonos</em>, which is the same word translated as deacon elsewhere in the New Testament.&nbsp; Furthermore, when Paul describes Phoebe as a helper of many, he uses a Greek verb often used in describing Paul himself as a leader and benefactor over the church. Taken together, the natural reading of Romans 16:1-2 proves that women served as deaconesses in the early church.</p>\n\n<p>What do these conclusions teach us about woman <em>pastors</em>? This is a more difficult question because technically speaking a pastor is not a position of leadership in the church. According to the Bible, a pastor is a type of spiritual service within the body. Just as some are gifted in prayer or teaching, some are gifted to pastor or shepherd God&#39;s people. We find the clearest mention of pastor in Paul&#39;s teaching in Ephesians:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 4:11 And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nCuriously, this is the <strong>only</strong> mention in all the New Testament letters of the role of pastor (<em>poimen</em> in Greek), and Paul includes the term pastor in a list of spiritual gifts. Apostles, prophets and teachers are all roles requiring specific evidence of specific spiritual gifts, and these giftings (apart from the unique role of apostles) were <em>not</em> automatically considered positions of church authority because they could be found among women just as with men.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, Paul&#39;s inclusion of the term pastor in a list of spiritual gifts strongly suggests he considered pastoring to be a spiritual gift rather than a position of authority (though unfortunately&nbsp;in the church today it is used as&nbsp;a defacto position of authority). Therefore, the question is can a woman use her spiritual gift of pastoring within the church&nbsp;<em>without</em> violating the Bible&#39;s restrictions on women leading men?</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We believe the answer is yes, provided the woman pastor&nbsp;conforms to the Biblical role and not to the modern version of the same.</span></p>\n\n<p>We have already established that church leadership is provided by elders&nbsp;and that elders must be men. Furthermore, leadership roles and spiritual gifts are independent of one another. A prophet can be an elder, an evangelist can be an elder, a teacher can be an elder, and a pastor can be an elder. On the other hand, not all teachers are elders, not all evangelists are elders, and therefore not all pastors are necessarily elders. With these constraints in mind, a woman can legitimately serve in the role pastor <em>provided </em>she doesn&#39;t&nbsp;assume a leadership or teaching&nbsp;position over men specifically.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Bible doesn&#39;t use the term \"pastor\" as a title of church leadership, women can serve as&nbsp;pastors in the sense of shepherds over a flock. The Spirit empowers both men and woman with the gift of pastoral ministry, so the church should encourage woman pastors to serve in their gift by shepherding God&#39;s people in appropriate ways. In this way, woman pastors provide valuable service to the body, particularly as shepherds over women&#39;s groups, children&#39;s ministries and outreach/evangelistic ministries.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;a woman pastor must serve under male headship. A woman pastor cannot serve as an overseer or elder in the church, though she could serve as a deaconess under the authority of male elders. Furthermore, while a woman pastor may refer to herself as a \"pastor\" (in the same way that a woman may call herself a \"teacher\" or \"evangelist\"), a women should be careful not to use that title to imply she has authority over men.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a woman pastor (or teacher) cannot exercise teaching or shepherding authority over a man or mixed-gender groups. She must limit her pastoral duties to shepherding women&#39;s groups and children unless she is pastoring as a team with her husband.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in reading more about a woman&#39;s role in the church, we invite you to read the <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/can_a_woman_teach_men_in_the_church/\">following articles</a></strong>.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Is it acceptable for Christians to participate in yoga?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA: Popular in&nbsp;Eastern culture for centuries, yoga has recently become a popular activity for many Westerners as well, including some professing Christians. A popular yoga website explains yoga this way:</p>\n\n<h5><em>Yoga means \"joined together.\" &nbsp;The word comes from the ancient Sanskrit root word yug, which means \"to unify.\" A yogi is one who consciously unifies body, mind, emotions, and spirit so that they work together very well.&nbsp; The yogi strives to open the gift of life and discover his fullest possibilities. A yogi endeavors to discover the higher consciousness and how the body, mind, and emotional nature can be truly fulfilled through unifying their purposes &mdash; rather than living in constant interior civil war.</em></h5>\n\n<p><br />\nBased on this description, yoga is an activity mixing&nbsp;physical exercise and Eastern mysticism, and therefore traditional yoga&nbsp;should be avoided by Christians. The stated goal of traditional yoga is two-fold. First, yoga seeks to \"unify\"&nbsp;body,&nbsp;mind, emotions and spirit and end the \"civil war\" inside us. Biblically, we know that the human experience can only be unified in perfection and peace through faith in Jesus Christ and the regeneration that comes as a result of His grace.</p>\n\n<p>No other means for unifying&nbsp;spirit and body exists, therefore the essential teaching of yoga qualifies as \"another Gospel,\" which competes with the Gospel of Jesus Christ for the hearts and mind of humanity. It is a lie of Satan intended as a stumbling block to prevent the world from knowing the truth.</p>\n\n<p>As&nbsp;Paul said, if anyone comes to us preaching another Gospel, we are to reject both the messenger and the&nbsp;message&nbsp;entirely:</p>\n\n<h5>Gal. 1:8 But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 1:9 As we have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Secondly, yoga claims to promote \"higher states of consciousness,\" which is coded language for seeking an encounter&nbsp;with the demonic realm. The Bible plainly&nbsp;commands&nbsp;believers to steer clear of worship of angels (demons) and to rely entirely on Christ for our spiritual enlightenment:</p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 2:18 Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 2:19 and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, associating with the enemy even in a casual way is a dangerous and foolish practice:</span></p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 6:15 Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 6:16 Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND WALK AMONG THEM;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 6:17 &ldquo;Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE SEPARATE,&rdquo; says the Lord.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And I will welcome you.&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 6:18 &ldquo;And I will be a father to you,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And you shall be sons and daughters to Me,&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Says the Lord Almighty.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Regardingless of any potential physical benefits of yoga, if the practice includes these mind techniques,&nbsp;it violates scripture and will lead the believer into unprofitable and potentially dangerous practices. The demonic realm is powerful and not something with which believers should experiment.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases you may find a yoga instructor who has dispensed with yoga&#39;s Eastern mysticism&nbsp;and teaches only the stretching and strengthening routines associated with yoga. Such classes may still be called \"yoga\" to indicate the style of exercise being offered, yet the class has little in common with&nbsp;traditional yoga. Specifically, exercise-only yoga events will have&nbsp;no calls to meditation, no appeals to higher consciousness and no talk of uniting body and mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Under these circumstances, such yoga groups&nbsp;are simply exercise classes, and therefore they are acceptable for believers to enjoy. Nevertheless, believers participating in this type of \"innocent\" yoga should remain on guard for any unexpected shift into mysticism by the instructors. If the class begins to&nbsp;move away from simply exercise and into&nbsp;a spiritual dimension, the believer should cease participating.&nbsp;</p>"

It&#39;s as if the Satan of the Old Testament isn&#39;t the same character as the one in the New Testament.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA:&nbsp;The book of Job opens with a scene in the Heavenly throne room where Satan meets with the Lord:</p>\n\n<h5>Job 1:6&nbsp; Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.&nbsp;<br />\nJob 1:7&nbsp;The LORD said to Satan, &ldquo;From where do you come?&rdquo; Then Satan answered the LORD and said, &ldquo;From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nJob 1:8&nbsp;The LORD said to Satan, &ldquo;Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nFirst, the term \"sons of God\" (ben elohim) is used only two places in the Bible. Once in Genesis 6 and in Job. In the three instances in Job, the context leaves no doubt the term is a reference to the angelic realm. The sons of God are the angels God created, including Satan himself who was the highest angel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We read about Satan&rsquo;s origins in Ezekiel 28:</p>\n\n<h5>Ezek. 28:12&nbsp; &ldquo;Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre and say to him, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord GOD,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;You had the seal of perfection,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:13&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You were in Eden, the garden of God;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Every precious stone was your covering:&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The ruby, the topaz and the diamond;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The beryl, the onyx and the jasper;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The lapis lazuli, the turquoise and the emerald;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the gold, the workmanship of your settings and sockets,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Was in you.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the day that you were created&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They were prepared.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You were the anointed cherub who covers,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And I placed you there.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You were on the holy mountain of God;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You walked in the midst of the stones of fire.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:15&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You were blameless in your ways&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From the day you were created&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Until unrighteousness was found in you.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 28:16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;By the abundance of your trade&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You were internally filled with violence,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And you sinned;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore I have cast you as profane&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From the mountain of God.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And I have destroyed you, O covering cherub,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From the midst of the stones of fire.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nSatan was created to be the &ldquo;covering cherub&rdquo; guarding the mercy seat of the Heavenly tabernacle until he fell in sin and was cast out of the tabernacle as profane.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the scriptures make clear Satan still has access to the throne room of God at least for a time. Clearly, Job shows Satan visiting the throne room at times when the entire assembly of the sons of God (i.e., the angels) are present (see Job 2:1).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Why does the Lord permit Satan such free access to the throne? Revelation 12 gives us a possible answer:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 12:7&nbsp; And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war,&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 12:8&nbsp;and they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 12:9&nbsp;And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 12:10&nbsp;Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, &ldquo;Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 12:11&nbsp;&ldquo;And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 12:12&nbsp;&ldquo;For this reason, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nRevelation 12 describes a moment in the future, in the middle of the seven year Tribulation on earth, when the Lord will finally and forever bar Satan and his demons from access to the heavenly throne room. Revelation 12 says that the expulsion of&nbsp;Satan means terrible things are in store&nbsp;for the inhabitants of the earth because Satan will understand he has little time remaining before Christ&#39;s return.</p>\n\n<p>Once Satan is barred from the throne room, he becomes desperate&nbsp;like a cornered animal. He will be&nbsp;enraged and seeking to strike back, and he takes his vengeance out on the in habitants of the earth. Since the Lord knows this will be the result of barring Satan from Heaven, the Lord has mercifully delayed this moment until the end of this age.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Satan in the Old Testament is not different than the&nbsp;Satan we see portrayed in the New Testament. On the contrary, the portrayal of Satan in&nbsp;Job is exactly like the Satan described in the New Testament, especially in Revelation. Notice in Job we see Satan making false accusations against Job, a man the Lord describes as an upright and God-fearing servant.&nbsp;Then in Revelation 12 we&rsquo;re told that the Satan expelled from Heaven is the very same serpent from the Old Testament, the one who accuses the brethren. The Revelation 12 reference to Satan accusing is a direct reference to Satan in Job.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: The Lord sent manna, bread from Heaven, to free the Israelites in the desert? Why doesn&#39;t the Lord send manna today to feed the hungry?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA: In <a href=\"/bible-studies/exodus\">Exodus</a> we learn that the Lord called Israel into the desert and then provided food for them supernaturally:</p>\n\n<h5>Ex. 16:11 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ex. 16:12 &ldquo;I have heard the grumblings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, &lsquo;At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ex. 16:13 &nbsp;So it came about at evening that the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ex. 16:14 When the layer of dew evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as the frost on the ground.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ex. 16:15 When the sons of Israel saw it, they said to one another, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, &ldquo;It is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\nFor the Israelites in the desert, the Lord supplied a special bread sent down from Heaven. This was a unique, one-time provision intended to do far more than merely feeding a group of people. God&#39;s plan was intended to&nbsp;picture the coming of His Son,&nbsp;the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>The Lord Himself said He is the bread from Heaven:</p>\n\n<h5>John 6:31&nbsp;&ldquo;Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, &lsquo;HE GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nJohn 6:32&nbsp;Jesus then said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of heaven.<br />\nJohn 6:33&nbsp;&ldquo;For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 6:34&nbsp;Then they said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, always give us this bread.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nJohn 6:35&nbsp; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst.<br />\nJohn 6:36&nbsp;&ldquo;But I said to you that you have seen Me, and yet do not believe.<br />\nJohn 6:37&nbsp;&ldquo;All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Lord declares that the manna given to Israel was a picture of Him. In the same way that a bread descended from Heaven to sustain the lives of the Israelites, now Jesus descended from Heaven so that He might become spiritual life for those who believe in Him.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Because this picture is so important to the Lord, He has not repeated the manna provision since the time of the wanderings. He intends for the world to understand that the manna given Israel was a one-time provision, just as Jesus is a one-time sacrifice for the sins of the world. If the Lord continued to bring food from Heaven, the world wouldn&rsquo;t understand the picture appropriately.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Notice in John 6 the Lord rebuked the people for caring more about physical bread than spiritual matters. Likewise, we must not become focused on how God meets our earthly needs but remain centered on His provision for our eternal life in Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the&nbsp;Lord is capable of meeting the needs of His people in many different ways. Generally He supplies the saints with provision through natural means, including farming or food markets, etc., though He always possesses the power to grant a supernatural provision. In the end, we know the Lord will always ensure proper provision to those who are His children by faith, as the word says:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 6:25&nbsp; &ldquo;For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?<br />\nMatt. 6:26&nbsp;&ldquo;Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?<br />\nMatt. 6:27&nbsp;&ldquo;And who of you by being worried can add a single hour to his life?<br />\nMatt. 6:28&nbsp;&ldquo;And why are you worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin,<br />\nMatt. 6:29&nbsp;yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.<br />\nMatt. 6:30&nbsp;&ldquo;But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith!<br />\nMatt. 6:31&nbsp;&ldquo;Do not worry then, saying, &lsquo;What will we eat?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What will we drink?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What will we wear for clothing?&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 6:32&nbsp;&ldquo;For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.<br />\nMatt. 6:33&nbsp;&ldquo;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Lord will not forget our earthly needs, Jesus says. We must keep in mind this promise is for those who seek His kingdom, as Jesus said in v.33. Unbelievers are also given a measure of mercy, but that provision is not assured, as we see around us in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more in-depth teaching on the connection between manna and Jesus, please see&nbsp;our <a href=\"/bible-studies/the-gospel-of-john\">Gospel of John Bible study</a>, particularly Lessons&nbsp;6A, 6B and 6C,<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "url": "https://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/why-apply-for-irs-recognition",
                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: I notice that VBVMI applied for 501(c)(3) status with the I.R.S. Why did you choose to subject your ministry to government oversight when it wasn&#39;t necessary?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA:&nbsp;In the United States a \"non-profit\" status may make an organization eligible for certain benefits, such as state sales, property, and income tax&nbsp;exemptions; however, this corporate&nbsp;status does not automatically grant exemption from federal income tax. To be tax-exempt, most organizations must apply for recognition of exemption from the&nbsp;Internal Revenue Service to obtain a ruling&nbsp;or determination letter recognizing tax exemption.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While VBVMI was not obligated to apply for such recognition by the IRS, there are several advantages to doing so. First,&nbsp;obtaining IRS recognition protects a non-profit from future tax disputes with the IRS and potential tax penalties.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, many corporate donors (and individual&nbsp;donors) require IRS recognition of non-profit status as a pre-requisite for making contributions.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, IRS recognition offers assurance to our donors that our&nbsp;ministry&nbsp;stewards our&nbsp;finances in a transparent and lawful manner.</p>\n\n<p>For these reason, the VBVMI Board of Director determined that it was prudent to seek IRS recognition of our non-profit status under section 501(c)(3) of the Code. This action&nbsp;removes unnecessary&nbsp;barriers to future donations while eliminating any tax burden&nbsp;that might&nbsp;reduce our operating funds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, submitting to governmental requirements in these matters is not only prudent but also biblical. As Paul commanded the church:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 13:1&nbsp;&nbsp;Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:2&nbsp;Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:3&nbsp;For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:4&nbsp;for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:5&nbsp;Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience&rsquo; sake.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:6&nbsp;For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice that Paul specifically mentions we are to be in subjection to the government on matters of paying taxes, which include seeking tax-exempt status in lawful ways.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Jesus gives similar instructions to His disciples:</p>\n\n<h5>Mark 12:14&nbsp;They&nbsp; came and&nbsp; said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, we know that You are truthful and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?&nbsp;<br />\nMark 12:15&nbsp;&ldquo;Shall we pay or shall we not pay?&rdquo; But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, &ldquo;Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to look at.&rdquo;<br />\nMark 12:16&nbsp;They brought one. And He&nbsp; said to them, &ldquo;Whose likeness and inscription is this?&rdquo; And they said to Him, &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMark 12:17&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And they were amazed at Him.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nJesus commands us to render to the government what the government requires because the government is empowered by God in matters of taxation (among other matters). Therefore, the Church must set a good example by obeying the government in this area. Since the United States government makes available a process for lawful exemption from taxes, VBVMI chose to pursue that process in keeping with the law.&nbsp;</p>"

What will be doing during those 1,000 years?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA: A full description of life in the Kingdom would require a very lengthy explanation, but fortunately VBVMI&nbsp;already offers such a description in our Revelation Bible study (see <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Lessons 20B &amp; 20C</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, the Church saints will play a role in judging the nations as part of the Kingdom government under Christ. First, the twelve apostles will rule over the tribes of Israel:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 19:27&nbsp; Then Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 19:28&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nSecondly, the Gentile church will judge the nations of the earth:</p>\n\n<h5>Dan. 7:27&nbsp;&lsquo;Then the sovereignty, the dominion and the greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve and obey Him.&rsquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 6:2&nbsp;Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? If the world is judged by you, are you not competent to constitute the smallest law courts?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nFurthermore, the Church will sit in judgment of fallen angels:</p>\n\n<p>1Cor. 6:3&nbsp;Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\nApart from our ruling authority, we will also live a full life of building, planting, harvesting and enjoying the feasts of the Lord. Speaking of Israel, the Lord describes some of what life in the Kingdom will be life for His people:</p>\n\n<h5>Is. 65:21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;They will build houses and inhabit them;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They will also plant vineyards and eat their fruit.&nbsp;<br />\nIs. 65:22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;They will not build and another inhabit,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They will not plant and another eat;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For as the lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And My chosen ones will wear out the work of their hands.&nbsp;<br />\nIs. 65:23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;They will not labor in vain,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Or bear children for calamity;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For they are the offspring of those blessed by the Lord,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And their descendants with them.&nbsp;<br />\nIs. 65:24&nbsp;&ldquo;It will also come to pass that before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.&nbsp;<br />\nIs. 65:25&nbsp;&ldquo;The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent&rsquo;s food. They will do no evil or harm in all My holy mountain,&rdquo; says the Lord.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThough this description is directed as Israel, it&rsquo;s fair to assume that the life of Gentile saints in the Kingdom will be similar.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: I read in Acts 16 that God promises to save an entire household when one person comes to faith. How can I secure this promise for my family?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA:&nbsp;In Acts 16 we read:</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 16:25&nbsp; But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;&nbsp;<br />\nActs 16:26&nbsp;and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone&rsquo;s chains were unfastened.&nbsp;<br />\nActs 16:27&nbsp;When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.&nbsp;<br />\nActs 16:28&nbsp;But Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nActs 16:29&nbsp;And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas,&nbsp;<br />\nActs 16:30&nbsp;and after he brought them out, he said, &ldquo;Sirs, what must I do to be saved?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nActs 16:31&nbsp;They said, &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nActs 16:32&nbsp;And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house.&nbsp;<br />\nActs 16:33&nbsp;And he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his household.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nAt this moment, Paul and Silas are in prison, and when the Lord delivers a supernatural prison break for these men, the jailer awakes and see the miracle God performs. Just as the jailer was preparing to kill himself (which Roman jailers were required to do if their prisoners escaped), Paul intervenes by the leading of the Holy Spirit and delivers the Gospel message.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Included in Paul&rsquo;s commands to this jailer was the promise that if the jailer believers, then his household would follow suit. And because all believed, all would be saved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Were Paul&rsquo;s words to this jailer meant to be a universal truth for all believers? Both the word of God and our personal experience tell us the answer is no. Paul&#39;s words are <strong><em>not</em></strong> a promise to all believers.</p>\n\n<p>First, scripture never makes such a promise to <em><strong>all</strong></em> believers. In this circumstance&nbsp;Paul gave a promise&nbsp;to one man, the jailer. Paul did not include this command in any of his letters writen to all believers, nor does Christ ever issue such a promise. When the Lord makes promises to all believers, His word makes clear that the promise is universal. We cannot assume that what Paul said to one person is automatically true for all believers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Proper interpretation of scripture requires that we distinguish between&nbsp;<em>descriptions</em> and <em>prescriptions</em>. In the Bible a&nbsp;description is any account of events, and&nbsp;a prescription is a specific command given&nbsp;to the believer. Descriptions (i.e., historical accounts, prophecy, etc.) are given in scripture&nbsp;to explain God and His character, purposes and plans. We simply cannot interpret such&nbsp;descriptions as commands or promises for all believers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, we read about David&rsquo;s adultery with Bathsheba in the Bible, but this account is not intended to prescribe adultery for all believers. Instead, we understand that David&rsquo;s mistake was merely described so we can learn from it. We also read in Isaiah 20 how the Lord commanded the prophet to live without clothing for three yerars, but this is not a prescription to the believer to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, Paul&rsquo;s instructions to the jailer were not a prescription for all believers. Instead, this scene was described for our benefit. Paul spoke under the inspiration of the Spirit and his words were intended solely for that man and his family. The events were described for us so that we might know about them, not so that we might expect the same outcome in our own lives.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, our personal experience confirms that this passage is NOT a prescription or promise for all believers. Unfortunately, many, many individuals have come to know Christ as Savior <span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">over the centuries <em>without</em>&nbsp;the rest of the family following suit. If we interpret Paul&#39;s comment as a&nbsp;promise from God to all believers, then what would&nbsp;we conclude about God&rsquo;s faithfulness? Did He make a promise that He didn&#39;t keep? Are we to say God is a liar?&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Never! Instead, we must conclude that this statement is <em>not</em> a promise to all believers. Instead, the Lord was speaking only about one man and his family, because the Lord chooses to&nbsp;saves those He wishes:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 9:15&nbsp;For He says to Moses, &ldquo;I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 9:16&nbsp;So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nWhile we should hope and pray for the Lord to save our unbelieving&nbsp;family members, we willl find&nbsp;no guarantee in scripture that the Lord is likely to&nbsp;do so. On the contrary, in many families the Lord chooses to save only some individuals while passing over others, according to His sovereign will.&nbsp;</p>"

When I read Romans 13, it says to be in subjection to governing authorities&nbsp;because they were chosen by God for good,&nbsp;but how can that be true when a leader is evil?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA; &nbsp;As you quoted, Romans 13 teaches that all believers are to be subject to ruling authorities:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 13:1&nbsp; Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:2&nbsp;Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:3&nbsp;For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:4&nbsp;for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:5&nbsp;Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for conscience&rsquo; sake.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:6&nbsp;For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 13:7&nbsp;Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nPaul explains that all who are in authority are there by God&rsquo;s choice, and therefore when we refuse to be in subjection to governing authorities, we oppose God. Notice that Paul does not say that those who occupy positions of authority are always good people. Rather, Paul says that God is working through human government for good purpose, and sometimes God appoints evil men to occupy positions of authority because God intends to use their sin to accomplish good purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon, and though he was not a &ldquo;good&rdquo; man, nevertheless the Lord used him to good purposes in bringing him to power. The king fought against Israel as God intended, taking them captive and holding the nation as slaves for 70 years. This outcome was good in the way it supported the Lord&rsquo;s purposes by preparing the prophet Daniel and punishing Israel for sins under the covenant. Remember, good is a standard based on God&rsquo;s perspective, not our earthly perspective.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So the ruler of any country is installed by God for His good purposes, and therefore we must remain in subjection to all authorities. Nevertheless, we may still oppose the policies of a government or object to a leader&#39;s judgments so long as we do so using legal means.</p>\n\n<p>In Babylon no mechanisms existed for opposing&nbsp;the king&#39;s decisions. He was the absolute authority in the land, so godly men and women had no option but&nbsp;to submit to his rulings. Today, we enjoy many rights for petitioning government and electing new officials, and we may take advantage of these lawful means as we desire&nbsp;without violating Romans 13. When we work within the rules of government, we are remaining in subjection to it as Paul commanded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we must be careful to ensure our words and heart attitudes also comport with the Bible&#39;s teaching in Romans 13.&nbsp;While we are not required to agree with the rulings of a leader, we may not speak or act in ways inconsistent with&nbsp;subjection to the government. For example, we should guard our speech to avoid insults, slander, gossip, and the like when speaking of leaders. Simialrly, we must maintain a proper and respectful attitude concerning our leaders since they rule by God&#39;s choice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if a government&#39;s demands upon us run contrary to God&rsquo;s word, then we must obey God while gladly suffering whatever penalty the government assesses for our disobedience. For example, Daniel&rsquo;s friends refused to worship false gods in Babylon, so the king ordered them thrown in the furnace. They submitted to this judgment without opposition. Likewise, if our government demands we violate our conscience, we must decline to obey and suffer the consequences gladly.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: In Revelation 7, the 144,000 Jewish men raised up to evangelize the world come&nbsp;from twelve tribes of Israel, but the tribe of Dan is missing from the list? Why?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA:&nbsp;The absence of Dan in the list of tribes in Revelation 7 is a source of much interest among Bible students. The text itself offers no explanation, but we can speculate based on some analysis.</p>\n\n<p>First, it&rsquo;s important to note that there are 13 named tribes in Israel, not twelve. Jacob bore twelve sons, but later Jacob adopted Joseph&rsquo;s two sons in place of Joseph after moving to Egypt. Thereafter, the sons of Jacob were:</p>\n\n<p>Reuben,&nbsp;Simeon,&nbsp;Levi,&nbsp;Judah,&nbsp;Zebulun,&nbsp;Issachar,&nbsp;Dan,&nbsp;Gad,&nbsp;Asher,&nbsp;Naphtali,&nbsp;Ephraim,&nbsp;Manasseh, and Benjamin</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, there are at least 19 lists of Jacob&#39;s sons given in the Old Testament:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Gen.&nbsp;35:22-26; 46:8-25; 49:3-27;&nbsp;Exod. 1:2-5;&nbsp;Num. 1:5-15; 2:3-31; 13:4-15;&nbsp;26:4-51; 34:19-28;&nbsp;Deut. 27:12-13; 33:6-25;&nbsp;Josh. 13:7-22;&nbsp;Judg. 5:12-18;&nbsp;1 Chron. 2:1-8:40; 12:24-37; 27:16-22;&nbsp;Ezek. 48:1-7, 23-28, 31-34</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Reviewing these lists, we usually find all thirteen tribes included though sometimes a tribe is left out (usually Levi). For example,&nbsp;in Numbers 1, 2, 13, and 26, the tribe of Levi is left out. In other cases, Joseph&rsquo;s two sons, Ephraim, and&nbsp;Manasseh are combined under just the name Joseph. In one case, multiple tribes are missing (i.e., Judge 5). So, we see that it&#39;s not unusual for scripture to leave names out when listing the tribes of Israel.</span></p>\n\n<p>But then we have the list in Revelation 7. This list is unique in&nbsp;a several ways. First, it is the only list of the tribes of Israel in scripture to exclude Dan.&nbsp;Secondly, it is the only list to include Joseph in place of only one of his sons instead of both sons.&nbsp;Specifically, Joseph and Manasseh appear in the Revelation 7 list but Ephraim does not.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Perhaps the exclusions of Dan and Ephraim are&nbsp;related?</span></p>\n\n<p>Thirdly,&nbsp;the territories originally&nbsp;allotted to the tribes of Ephraim and Dan bordered one another in Canaan, but during the time of Judges&nbsp;Dan rejected its claim and moved&nbsp;north to occupy a part of the territory of Naphtali.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, even though the name Joseph is listed in Revelation 7, no&nbsp;territory or tribe of Joseph actually exists.&nbsp;Joseph didn&rsquo;t receive a portion in the land. His two sons were adopted by Jacob and received Joseph&rsquo;s double portion instead. This raises the question how can there&nbsp;be 12,000 men from \"Joseph\" during Tribulation&nbsp;when no such tribe of people exists?</p>\n\n<p>Given these clues, we can offer speculation on why Dan and&nbsp;Ephraim are&nbsp;missing from the list.</p>\n\n<p>In Judges 17-21&nbsp;we&#39;re given two stories of apostasy in Israel. Both stories center on the tribes of Dan and Ephraim and on the city of&nbsp;Bethlehem, the birthplace of David, God&#39;s choice for king over Israel. The writer of Judges emphasizes in these chapters that these were the days before Israel had a king.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In those chapters of Judges, Dan sinned by viewing the land God allotted to them as unacceptable, so they abandoned it.&nbsp;While passing through Ephraim, they&nbsp;stole idols from a home and recruited a Levite to serve in a false temple in the new territory.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">As a result,&nbsp;Dan became the first tribe in Israel to embrace&nbsp;idol worship&nbsp;in Israel.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Meanwhile, the tribe of Ephraim, the source of the idols,&nbsp;assumed control over the land originally intended for Dan. They aided and abetted the Danites in bringing idolatry into the land of Israel.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">These sins give just cause for God to exclude them from the privilege of preparing Israel and the world for the Messiah&#39;s return.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, s</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">ince the tribe of Manasseh is already included&nbsp;in the list of Revelation 7, then we know that the tribe of Joseph can&#39;t represent his two sons, as is usually the case in scripture.&nbsp;Instead, &nbsp;Joseph still&nbsp;represents two tribes, but in this case Joseph replaces&nbsp;Dan and Ephraim, tribes&nbsp;historically and&nbsp;geographically linked by their conspiracy to introduce&nbsp;rebellion and idolatry into Israel. So they were excluded from this list by name with the name Joseph standing in their place.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Such a&nbsp;substitution allowed the Lord to retain the symmetry of twelve tribes while drawing attention to these tribes&#39; joint contribution to idolatry in Israel.&nbsp;Since there is no literal tribe of Joseph, in a sense, we could say that Dan and Ephraim were &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; in Joseph.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">If so, then the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">12,000 men of the tribe of Joseph&nbsp;in the Tribulation will actually be&nbsp;Danites and Ephraimites.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">But there is a deeper message in their exclusion.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The apostasy of Dan and Ephraim represented the low point in Israel&#39;s history immediately prior to the Lord raising up a king from Bethlehem to deliver Israel from its sin.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Sound familiar?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This is exactly the pattern that will exist prior to the Lord&#39;s return to rule over Israel at the end of Tribulation. By excluding these two tribes from the list in Revelation 7, the Lord is pointing our attention back to the circumstances at the end of Judges. The final chapters of Judges (17-21) and the story of Ruth which follows Judges form&nbsp;a three-part story of the king&#39;s arrival to address the nation&#39;s idolatry.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Parts 1 and 2 of the story are found in Judges 17-21 and chronicle the growing apostasy of Israel under the influence of the Danites and Ephramites. Part 3 of the story is found in Ruth, where the Messiah&#39;s arrival in Bethlehem (pictured by the arrival of Naomi&#39;s son in Bethlehem) serves as&nbsp;the hope of Israel. These events picture the greater arrival of Christ to rescue Israel from apostasy.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, Dan and Ephraim are missing in the list of Revelation 7 to draw our attention to the time of Judges, to illustrate that Israel is once again guilty of apostasy&nbsp;as it was in Judges under Dan and Ephraim. And once again the Lord will bring Israel a king from Bethlehem to rescue Israel from its apostasy, that is Jesus Christ. By excluding these two tribes, the Lord is emphasizing that the third part of the story is right around the corner.&nbsp;</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Are we two parts,&nbsp;body and soul,&nbsp;or are we three parts,&nbsp;body, soul and spirit?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A: All human beings are made of two parts, body and spirit. In scripture, the words for \"spirit\" and \"soul\" are used interchangeably&nbsp;as&nbsp;synonyms, as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ariel.org\">Dr. Arnold Fructhenbaum</a> explains:</p>\n\n<hr />\n<pre>\n\"...the terms &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; are used &#10;interchangeably and not seen in Scripture as &#10;being two totally distinct entities. That these &#10;are used interchangeably is seen in three ways. &#10;First, the same functions are ascribed to both &#10;the soul and the spirit. For example, they both &#10;get depressed (Gen. 41:8; Ps. 42:6); troubled &#10;(Jn. 12:27;13:21); both are connected with the &#10;giving up of life (Mat. 20:28; 27:50); both are &#10;seen as being in Heaven (Heb. 12:23; Rev. 6:9); &#10;both can glorify God (Lk. 1:46 47); and both were &#10;involved in the sacrifice of the Messiah (Jn. 10:15;&#10;19:30). A second way of showing that soul and &#10;spirit are used interchangeably is that death &#10;is the giving up of either the soul or the spirit. &#10;Whether a person gives up his soul (Gen. 35:18;&#10;1Kg. 17:21; Acts 15:26), or gives up the spirit &#10;(Ps. 31:5; Lk. 23:46; Acts 7:59), it is viewed as &#10;physical death. A third way to see that the soul &#10;and spirit are used interchangeably is that the &#10;dead are referred to by both names. Sometimes the &#10;dead are referred to as souls (Rev. 6:9; 20:4), &#10;and sometimes as spirits (Heb. 12:23; I Pet. 3:19).\"&#10;&#10;</pre>\n\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So men do not possess both a soul and a spirit. These are one and the same. Human beings possess a physical&nbsp;body (or flesh) made from the ground, and a&nbsp;spirit God \"breathed\" into the first man,&nbsp;as Genesis explains:</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 2:7 Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nLater, at the moment Adam sinned, the human spirit died as God promised in <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis</a> 2:17:</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 2:17 but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nAfter the Lord had discovered the sin of Adam and Woman, He declared a curse on the ground, leading all things that come from the ground to die physically:</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 3:17&nbsp; Then to Adam He said, &ldquo;Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, &lsquo;You shall not eat from it&rsquo;;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cursed is the ground because of you;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;In toil you will eat of it&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">All the days of your life.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Gen. 3:18 &nbsp;&ldquo;Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And you will eat the plants of the field;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Gen. 3:19 &nbsp; By the sweat of your face&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">You will eat bread,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Till you return to the ground,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; Because from it you were taken;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;For you are dust,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;And to dust you shall return.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Since that time, Adam has reproduced after his kind, so all mankind has been born in his likeness, possessing both a body and a spirit in sin from birth.&nbsp;Therefore, all mankind possess&nbsp;a dead spirit and a dying body, but by faith in Christ, we are born again in the spirit and one day will receive a new eternal body. There is no third part.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Nevertheless, Christians (and even scripture) continue to use words like soul, heart, mind, will, etc. to describe various aspects of our being, but collectively, these labels merely describe one or the other part of our two-part nature. God created mankind with both a material form (i.e., flesh) and immaterial form (i.e., spirit or soul). Our material form will die and go to the grave, but our immaterial form is eternal, and at the resurrection, our spirit will be reunited with a new body. Our body and spirit work together to produce everything we experience as human beings, including experiences we call the mind, will, emotions, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We use these labels to describe various experiences of our consciousness, but these experiences do not constitute distinct \"parts\" of our existence. If we could dissect a human being spiritually, we would not find a \"mind\" separate from a \"will\" and separate from \"emotion.\" We would only find flesh and spirit. Our emotions, will, mind, etc. result from our flesh and spirit working together. The Bible says the interplay between our flesh and spirit produces all that we are. Please see <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans</a> 7 to read Paul&#39;s explanation of how flesh and spirit work together in this way.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For example, in <a href=\"/bible-studies/hebrews\">Hebrews</a> 4:12, the writer of Hebrews says:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 4:12 For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In this verse, the writer uses \"soul\" and \"spirit\" as synonyms for our spirit, just as he uses&nbsp;\"joints\" and \"marrow\" as synonyms for flesh.&nbsp;The writer uses&nbsp;two synonyms for each part of mankind. Therefore, Hebrews is saying that the word of God separates the immaterial (soul, spirit) from the material (joints, marrow). The writer was not defining four parts to our existence.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In a second example, Paul refers in IThessalonians 5:23 to spirit, soul, and body:</span></p>\n\n<h5>1Th. 5:23 &nbsp;Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Though Paul uses three terms in his list, we can find other scriptures that make even more distinctions. For example, </span></p>\n\n<h5>Luke&nbsp;10:27&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Based on this single verse, are we&nbsp;to conclude that mankind consists of four elements: heart, soul, strength, and mind? If one applies the same logic of interpretation to Luke 10:27 as in I Thessalonians 5:23, then we would have to conclude that man has four distinct parts, not merely three. But clearly, this was not Christ&#39;s intent when He spoke those words.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, assuming each label in 1Thess 5:23 describes a separate element of our being is faulty logic and improper interpretation. In reality, writers of scripture often use synonymous terms in a list to add emphasis to their point. So when Paul said \"spirit and soul\" he was emphasizing the entire spirit of man. He wasn&#39;t describing two different elements of our nature, no more than Christ was describing four parts to our nature in Luke 10:27.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Isn&#39;t the Christian supposed to defend biblical marriage in the courts and legislatures?&nbsp;Doesn&#39;t the Christian have a mission to oppose society&#39;s&nbsp;departure from God&#39;s moral law?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">A:&nbsp;Before we address the heart of your question, we need to clarify what the Law of God&rsquo;s is. God&rsquo;s law is not limited to a set of &ldquo;moral&rdquo; laws within the overall Mosaic Law, as some maintain. In scripture, there is no distinction between a &ldquo;moral&rdquo; law and any other part of the law. As James said, if we break one law, we are guilty of the whole law. Either a person keeps the entire law, or else there is no advantage in keeping part of it.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In reality, there is only one Law, which consists of all 613 commandments, statutes and ordinances given to Israel by Moses. Jesus Christ kept that Law perfectly so that He could meet its terms on our behalf. When we come to faith in Jesus Christ, we fulfill the requirements of God&rsquo;s Law through our reliance on&nbsp;Messiah&#39;s sinless life and His atoning death&nbsp;in our place.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">(If you are interested in a more in-depth discussion of the&nbsp;Christian life and the Law, please read <a href=\"/bible-answers/is-a-christian-under-the-law-of-moses\">Is a Christian Under the Law of Moses</a>, <a href=\"/devotionals/on_law_and_liberty_part_1\">On Law and Liberty</a>, and <a href=\"/bible-answers/will_the_law_ever_pass_away\">Will the Law Ever Pass Away</a>?)</span></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the only way we bring the world into conformity with God&rsquo;s Law is through the same means we were conformed ourselves: by faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As Jesus Himself instructed us, the mission of the church is simple:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 28:19&nbsp;&ldquo;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,<br />\nMatt. 28:20&nbsp;teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nAs the Great Commission directs, the Church is called to make disciples of Christ, which implies recruiting them to&nbsp;Christ by sharing the Gospel. Once a person accepts Christ as Lord, then we continue serving them by teaching them to obey the commands of Christ. This is the mission of the Church, and as we fulfill this mission, God&rsquo;s elect will hear, believe and be conformed to the image of God.</p>\n\n<p>Notice, Jesus gave&nbsp;no commands to teach the <strong><em>world</em></strong> to obey Christ&rsquo;s commands but only to teach&nbsp;those who were already His disciples by faith, for obedience&nbsp;apart from becoming Christ&#39;s disciple through faith is impossible. Only by believing in Christ does someone have the potential&nbsp;to live in agreement with&nbsp;the Law of God. In fact, the scriptures teach it is impossible for fallen,&nbsp;sinful humanity to conform to the word of God:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 8:5&nbsp;For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 8:6&nbsp;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 8:7&nbsp;because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 8:8&nbsp;and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The unbeliever is living in the flesh and not by the Spirit, therefore they lack the ability to conform to God&rsquo;s Law, while those who are saved are led by the Spirit of God&nbsp;into agreement with the Law. Only by faith in Jesus Christ can anyone meet the terms of God&rsquo;s Law, and by that same faith we are equipped to live according to its precepts as we are sanctified by the Spirit.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Moreover, the Church is called to testify to our faith by our lifestyle choices. As we live out our faith in obedience to Christ&#39;s commands, we show Christ in us and represent His holiness before the world. Just as&nbsp;the tabernacle shined the light of God&rsquo;s glory in Israel, so does the Church shine the Light of Christ in the world today.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we should anticipate that our lifestyle and biblical viewpoint will often come into conflict with world&rsquo;s views (as in the case of marriage), and in those circumstances the believer must stand firm in the truth and suffer whatever consequences come as a result.</p>\n\n<p>If God did not spare the apostles and early church fathers &ndash; and did not even spare His Son &ndash; then we have no reason to expect Him to spare us from persecution either. In fact, the scripture says plainly we will be persecuted and we should rejoice in it:</p>\n\n<h5>John 15:20&nbsp;&ldquo;Remember the word that I said to you, &lsquo;A slave is not greater than his master.&rsquo; If they&nbsp;persecuted&nbsp;Me, they will also&nbsp;persecute&nbsp;you; if they kept My word, they will keep yours also.</h5>\n\n<h5><br />\nMatt. 5:11&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed are you when people insult you and&nbsp;persecute&nbsp;you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.<br />\nMatt. 5:12&nbsp;&ldquo;Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they&nbsp;persecuted&nbsp;the prophets who were before you.</h5>\n\n<h5><br />\nActs 5:41&nbsp;So they went on their way from the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5><br />\nJames 1:2&nbsp; Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,&nbsp;<br />\nJames 1:3&nbsp;knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nAs the world moves away from the biblical view of marriage, the Church must continue living and teaching the Bible&rsquo;s perspective on marriage while understanding that we will be at odds with the world. We will likely suffer persecution for these beliefs. We accept these outcomes as the natural consequences of following Christ, because p<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">ersecution is the unavoidable result of representing Christ before His enemies.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">No one comes to faith because of another person&rsquo;s holiness. A&nbsp;heart is converted&nbsp;because it is first&nbsp;convicted of sin, repents&nbsp;and receives the love of&nbsp;Christ through faith, but this&nbsp;process can be furthered in God&rsquo;s economy by&nbsp;the testimonies&nbsp;of godly men and women who suffer for their faith. Therefore, we preach the truth, we live the truth, and we suffer the hatred of a world convicted by what they hear and see in us in the&nbsp;hope and expectation that the Lord may save some through our obedience.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the Church cannot accomplish this mission through political speech or legislation action. Instead, we accomplish it by the word of God. We preach the Gospel that lives may be transformed, we teach the word so that disciples may become obedient to the words of Christ, and we suffer gladly as the Lord appoints.</p>\n\n<p>As we do these things in humility and love, we will impact the world, recruiting some for the kingdom.&nbsp;In summary, the church must remain focused on our Christ-given mission of winning souls for the kingdom without becoming distracted by vain and fruitless efforts to legislate the kingdom&rsquo;s standards upon the fallen world.</p>\n\n<p>When a ship is sinking, we don&rsquo;t strike up the band to cheer on the doomed passengers. Instead, we get as many people as we can off the ship and into the lifeboats. That&rsquo;s the loving response to impending disaster.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Does the Bible say anything about cremation vs. burial?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA:&nbsp;The Bible makes no mention of cremation specifically. In almost all cases where the disposal of a body is recorded in scripture, burial is the method described. Typically, in the eastern culture, a dead body was first placed in an above-ground tomb (often a cave), and then after a year or more, the dried bones would be removed and placed in a coffin for burial underground.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In at least one notable case, a dead body&nbsp;were burned before burial. King Saul was killed in battle against&nbsp;the Philistines and his body was decapitated. When the Israelites recovered his body from Beth-she&#39;an, they burned it before burial:</p>\n\n<h5>1Sam. 31:8&nbsp;&nbsp;It came about on the next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Sam. 31:9 They cut off his head and stripped off his weapons, and sent them throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to the house of their idols and to the people.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Sam. 31:10 They put his weapons in the temple of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Sam. 31:11 Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Sam. 31:12 all the valiant men rose and walked all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Jabesh and burned them there.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Sam. 31:13 They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In this case, the burning of the body was intended to purify it&nbsp;before burial, and even after the burning, Saul&#39;s remains were&nbsp;still buried. In a few other cases, the Lord Himself chose to put&nbsp;sinners to death by fire, but these examples were&nbsp;not cremation of dead bodies but rather death by burning. Apart from these unique examples,&nbsp;burial was the perferred means of disposal for the dead in scripture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Burial was preferred because Old Testament saints desired to use their death as a testimony of faith in the Living God. For example, the patriarchs all insisted that they be buried in places that reflected the presence of God on Earth and in keeping with their expectations for resurrection in the Promised Land, as the writer of Hebrews reminds us:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 11:22 By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Joseph gave orders that his bones would be buried in the Promised Land, because he wanted his burial location to reflect his faith in God&rsquo;s promise of resurrection in the Promised Land. Similarly, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob asked to be buried in the Promised Land since they expected to receive that land as their eternal inheritance in the Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that God&rsquo;s promises didn&rsquo;t require the patriarchs to be buried in the land in order to receive it in eternity. Rather, the patriarch chose to be buried in the land as a testimony of their faith. They wanted their death to be a testimony in the same way that their lives had been a testimony, as Hebrews points out:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 11:8&nbsp; By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 11:9 By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 11:10 for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 11:13&nbsp; All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 11:14 For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 11:15 And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 11:16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them. &nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Abraham and his wife and sons lived as wanderers in the land God gave them because they knew they would not receive it until they were resurrected. So they made no claim to the land in their earthly life because they believed it would only be theirs in the Kingdom. Likewise, they chose to be buried in the land as a testimony that they would rise and live in that land again.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For these people,&nbsp;burial was an important testimony of their faith in the resurrection. Cremation cannot communicate the same message. So, does the&nbsp;patriarchs&rsquo; preference&nbsp;of burial become a requirement for the New Testament believer? Are we required to be buried instead of cremated?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In a word, no. In the Bible, we must differentiate between&nbsp;description and prescription. Many events and actions are described in scripture, but these&nbsp;descriptions do not automatically become a prescription for the New Testament believer. Only if something is&nbsp;specifically ordered for us does it become a&nbsp;requirement for us.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In this case, there is no prescription for burial in the scripture. Therefore, we are free by our liberty in Christ to choose burial or cremation. Nevertheless, some might argue that burial more clearly&nbsp;communicates faith in the resurrection, should we desire to use our death as a testimony of our faith. Again, this choice is personal and we have liberty to decide as we feel led.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: My&nbsp;older brother invited me to attend his homosexual wedding ceremony. He claims to be a Christian, though for obvious reasons I doubt he is. Would&nbsp;it be wrong for me to attend anyway?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><strong>A:</strong> We understand the difficulty of your decision. Many Christians have elected to forgo participation in homosexual weddings, including caterers, photographers, venue owners, dressmakers, caterers, pastors and even guests and family members. We certainly understand and respect these decisions.</p>\n\n<p>The question we must answer is&nbsp;does the Bible set down specific guidelines for this decision or is it merely a question of personal conviction?&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Before we answer this question, we recommend you read the following articles on </span><a href=\"/bible-answers/should_i_attend_the_wedding_of_atheists\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">attending weddings of atheists</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> and on the </span><a href=\"/bible-answers/is_it_ok_to_be_homosexual_and_a_christian\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">biblical view of&nbsp;homosexuality</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">.</span></p>\n\n<p>Turning to your question directly, the Bible teaches that if a man or woman professes to be a <em><strong>Christian</strong></em> while engaging in immoral behavior, the Church must refrain from associating with such a person:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 5:9&nbsp; I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 5:10&nbsp;I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world, or with the covetous and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 5:11&nbsp;But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler &mdash; not even to eat with such a one.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 5:12&nbsp;For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Do you not judge those who are within the church?<br />\n1Cor. 5:13&nbsp;But those who are outside, God judges. REMOVE THE WICKED MAN FROM AMONG YOURSELVES.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nPaul commands that any immoral person who calls&nbsp;themselves a Christian must be put outside fellowship from the body of Christ. <u>Therefore, if a practicing homosexual claims to be a Christian, then&nbsp;the Bible commands us not to associate with such a person nor even eat a meal with him</u>. The purpose for this strict treatment is to encourage the believer to repent and cease the immoral behavior, and in the meantime, to protect the flock from their immoral influence.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if we doubt the person&#39;s profession of faith (i.e., whether they are truly born again or merely pretending to be a Christian). Even Paul himself acknowledged that an immoral person may be a false confessor (i.e., a &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; brother). Nevertheless, Paul says in this situation we must take any claim of faith in Christ at face-value and respond by distancing ourselves from such a person.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the vast majority of practicing homosexuals do not profess faith in Christ, so our guidelines for associating with them are more flexible. <u>In fact, Paul specifically stated he did <em><strong>not</strong></em> say don&rsquo;t associate with immoral unbelievers</u>. Therefore, association with unbelievers &ndash; no matter how immoral &ndash; is possible, and in most cases necessary to accomplishing the mission of the Church. Remember, even Christ elected to enter the homes of prostitutes and eat with&nbsp;&ldquo;sinners and&nbsp;tax collectors,&rdquo; who were the immoral people of His day.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, a Christian may accept an invitation to eat in the&nbsp;home&nbsp;of an unbelieving homosexual couple, or attend their birthday party or even study scripture together with them, etc.&nbsp;All of these&nbsp;encounters hold the possibility of witnessing to them regarding Christ and the salvation He offers by His grace. Unless we are willing to associate with the lostness of the world, we can never hope to influence it for Christ.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there are some situations where our participation holds&nbsp;little possibility of producing fruit for Christ but yet holds great potential for personal corruption or an erosion of our Christian witness. For example, Paul&nbsp;chastised the Corinthian church for abusing their liberty when they joined in pagan rituals at pagan temples:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 8:9&nbsp;But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 8:10&nbsp;For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol&rsquo;s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 8:11&nbsp;For through your knowledge he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 8:12&nbsp;And so, by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul acknowledged that idols were merely stone and wood, therefore they held no power over the believer. Nevertheless, he instructed believers to steer clear of these ceremonies because they hold potential to confuse and mislead less mature Christians.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Paul told the church not to get comfortable spending time around immorality or idolatry, since even Christians can be tempted into sin by such things.</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 10:7&nbsp;Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, &ldquo;THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK, AND STOOD UP TO PLAY.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:8&nbsp;Nor let us act immorally, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:9&nbsp;Nor let us try the Lord, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the serpents.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:10&nbsp;Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:11&nbsp;Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:12&nbsp;Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed that he does not fall.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:13&nbsp;No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:14&nbsp; Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:15&nbsp;I speak as to wise men; you judge what I say.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Finally, scripture makes clear we can sin by approving the sin others:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 14:21 It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or to do anything by which your brother stumbles.<br />\nRom. 14:22 The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.</h5>\n\n<p>Consequently, we have a mission as Christians to balance to commandments: associate with the unbelieving world so we may reach them for Christ while guarding ourselves from entering into sin or approving the sin of others. We are called to represent the truth to a world lost in darkness and deceived by the enemy&rsquo;s lies, but we can&#39;t do that effectively&nbsp;if we compromise on the truth ourselves or agree with the lies through our behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To sum up his point, Paul&nbsp;gives these basic guidelines:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 10:23&nbsp; All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:24&nbsp;Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 10:31&nbsp;Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:32&nbsp;Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:33&nbsp;just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit but the profit of the many, so that they may be saved.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul says all things are lawful, in the sense that we have liberty to make many different choices in matters that are not explicitly regulated by scripture. Nevertheless,&nbsp;our rule for how we act&nbsp;isn&#39;t merely whether&nbsp;something is permissible. Our&nbsp;decisions should be guided by whether a course of action is both lawful <em><strong>and</strong></em> spiritually&nbsp;profitable.</p>\n\n<p>Attending or participating in the wedding of a homosexual couple is lawful in the sense that scripture doesn&rsquo;t prohibit our involvement explicitly, but the question remains is doing do spiritually profitable for us and for our unbelieving friends? Paul says in answering that question we must seek the good of our neighbor without acting contrary to our conscience. Furthermore, Paul says don&rsquo;t give offense to anyone, including to the church of God. Seek the profit of the &ldquo;many&rdquo; not merely your own profit.</p>\n\n<p><u>Applying these standards, we must conclude that participating in or even&nbsp;attending a homosexual marriage ceremony is unprofitable for the Christian</u>.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Unlike other types of gatherings (e.g., meals, birthday parties, etc.), a wedding ceremony is a formal proceeding where those in attendance serve a role as witnesses&nbsp;gathered in support of the union. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In fact, many wedding ceremonies still incorporate an opportunity for wedding attendees to offer reason why the couple&nbsp;should not wed. This tradition reflects the importance of attendees serving as witnesses at a wedding ceremony, therefore a person&rsquo;s&nbsp;decision to attend any wedding is an implicit statement of support for the proceedings.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Bible teaches clearly that the only appropriate sexual union permitted by God is in the context of marriage between&nbsp;a man and a woman. Any other sexual union is immoral and ungodly, and therefore a Christian cannot be party to such sin. When a Christian attends a marriage ceremony for a homosexual couple, the believer serves as a witness&nbsp;to the union and implicitly approves another&#39;s&nbsp;sin.</p>\n\n<p>In doing so, the&nbsp;believer acts&nbsp;contrary to scripture and to the believer&#39;s own&nbsp;convictions&nbsp;for e<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">ven if the&nbsp;believer silently disagrees with the proceedings in his or her heart, nevertheless attending&nbsp;the ceremony communicates public approval. As Paul said in Romans 14, believers&nbsp;will be judged by the Lord for the evil we approve.</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, in 1Corinthians 10 Paul says believers must not give offense &ldquo;to the church of God.&rdquo; The church of God is a reference to Christ Himself, His Gospel and all who are His disciples. When a believer acts in ungodly or immoral ways (or approves such things), he or she is giving&nbsp;offense by shaming the name of Christ,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">undermining&nbsp;the Gospel call to repent and believe&nbsp;in Christ, and dishonoring&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">the sacrifices of past disciples who have given their lives standing for the truth.</span></p>\n\n<p>According to these biblical guidelines, attending a homosexual union (or granting our approval otherwise) is an offense to the church of God. As&nbsp;Christians, we are ambassadors for Christ, so we must always stand for truth, including the truth of biblical marriage and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. While our decision not to attend homosexual weddings&nbsp;will likely offend some, we cannot make pleasing men our highest goal.&nbsp;Instead, our highest&nbsp;goal is pleasing the Lord.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the message and values of Christianity have always&nbsp;offended&nbsp;the unsaved world, so we should not be surprised when we&nbsp;face scorn and persecution for living according to biblical truth. Just as prior generations of martyrs were persecuted for the faith and as our Savior faced the cross for His testimony, so will we suffer at times. While we shouldn&#39;t invite persecution, neither can we run from it.</p>\n\n<p>As Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>John 15:18&nbsp;&ldquo;If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before it hated you.<br />\nJohn 15:19&nbsp;&ldquo;If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you.<br />\nJohn 15:20&nbsp;&ldquo;Remember the word that I said to you, &lsquo;A slave is not greater than his master.&rsquo; If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word, they will keep yours also.<br />\nJohn 15:21&nbsp;&ldquo;But all these things they will do to you for My name&rsquo;s sake, because they do not know the One who sent Me.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Although attending a homosexual wedding&nbsp;ceremony may allow us to preserve a friendship or perhaps open opportunities to share the Gospel with those in attendance&nbsp;(we argued this point as reason to attend an atheist wedding),&nbsp;nevertheless these potential benefits do not justify our attendance given the serious risks.&nbsp;Therefore, if a Christian receives an invitation to such a gathering, he or she should politely decline.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong>Q: Recently, I heard someone using&nbsp;the term&nbsp;\"spiritual adultery.\"&nbsp;What does this term mean?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">A: The term &ldquo;spiritual adultery&rdquo; (or emotional affair) does not appear in scripture, nevertheless we can find the concept in the Bible. Specifically, the Bible&nbsp;describes idolatry as a type of&nbsp;adultery. We can see this metaphor in Ezekiel 16 (among others places) when the Lord rebukes Israel for their unfaithfulness:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Ezek. 16:8&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I passed by you and saw you, and behold, you were at the time for love; so I spread My skirt over you and covered your nakedness. I also swore to you and entered into a covenant with you so that you became Mine,&rdquo; declares the Lord GOD.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:9 &ldquo;Then I bathed you with water, washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:10 &ldquo;I also clothed you with embroidered cloth and put sandals of porpoise skin on your feet; and I wrapped you with fine linen and covered you with silk.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:11 &ldquo;I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:12 &ldquo;I also put a ring in your nostril, earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:13 &ldquo;Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your dress was of fine linen, silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey and oil; so you were exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:14 &ldquo;Then your fame went forth among the nations on account of your beauty, for it was perfect because of My splendor which I bestowed on you,&rdquo; declares the Lord GOD.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:15&nbsp; &ldquo;But you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot because of your fame, and you poured out your harlotries on every passer-by who might be willing.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:16 &ldquo;You took some of your clothes, made for yourself high places of various colors and played the harlot on them, which should never come about nor happen.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:17 &ldquo;You also took your beautiful jewels made of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images that you might play the harlot with them.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:18 &ldquo;Then you took your embroidered cloth and covered them, and offered My oil and My incense before them.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:19 &ldquo;Also My bread which I gave you, fine flour, oil and honey with which I fed you, you would offer before them for a soothing aroma; so it happened,&rdquo; declares the Lord GOD.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:20 &ldquo;Moreover, you took your sons and daughters whom you had borne to Me and sacrificed them to idols to be devoured. Were your harlotries so small a matter?&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:21 &ldquo;You slaughtered My children and offered them up to idols by causing them to pass through the fire.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 16:22 &ldquo;Besides all your abominations and harlotries you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare and squirming in your blood.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Lord compares the nation of Israel to a young bride raised up for the purpose of honoring God, Who is Israel&#39;s Husband by covenant. Rather than remaining faithful to the Lord, the nation of Israel played the &ldquo;harlot&rdquo; by worshipping other gods, the Lord says. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In a sense, the Lord called Israel an adulteress who &ldquo;cheated&rdquo; on Her Husband by worshipping foreign gods.&nbsp;The Lord uses adultery as a metaphor for spiritual unfaithfulness, and in that sense, the Bible includes the concept of \"spiritual adultery&rdquo; (if not the words).<br />\n&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h4>A New Use of the Term<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>More recently, however, the term spiritual adultery has been used&nbsp;to describe any inappropriate, nonsexual relationship between a man and a woman that doesn&#39;t otherwise qualify as literal adultery (i.e.&nbsp;no sexual act was involved). We presume the term was coined for relationships that fall in the&nbsp;grey area&nbsp;between an ordinary, casual friendship&nbsp;and an illicit,&nbsp;sexual affair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For example, consider the situation of a man and a&nbsp;woman who are married to other people who form a&nbsp;personal friendship. Over time, the couple grows very close and spends increasing&nbsp;time together without their spouses&#39; knowledge. Eventually, they&nbsp;begin to&nbsp;meet for private dinners, conduct frequent phone conversations, and exchange intimate texts or letters. Still,&nbsp;the couple never engages in sexual contact of any kind.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Is this couple guilty of adultery?</span></p>\n\n<p>Despite the troubling nature of such a relationship, we cannot call it&nbsp;adultery. Adultery, by definition, is a sexual relationship outside marriage. For example, consider the comparison between adultery and prostitution:</p>\n\n<h5>Hos. 4:14&nbsp; &nbsp;I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Or your brides when they commit adultery,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For the men themselves go apart with harlots&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So the people without understanding are ruined.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The Lord speaking in Hosea says He will not punish Israel&#39;s daughters when they play the harlot, which He equates with adultery and prostitution. Obviously, the services offered by&nbsp;harlots and prostitutes revolve around&nbsp;sexual acts, not merely spending quality time together! So if adultery is equal to prostitution, then it involves sexual contact.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/adultery\" target=\"_blank\">legal definition</a>&nbsp;defines adultery as:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"...voluntary&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;relations&nbsp;between&nbsp;an&nbsp;individual&nbsp;who&nbsp;is&nbsp;married&nbsp;and&nbsp;someone&nbsp;who&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the individual&#39;s&nbsp;spouse.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>Again, adultery is a sexual act, by definition.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;our example relationship of the man and woman is&nbsp;not without sin. Such a&nbsp;relationship will likely involve&nbsp;sins of lust, lying or coveting. In the worst cases, the relationship will eventually result in literal adultery, but until such time that&nbsp;the relationship involves sexual contact,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">how would we describe the relationship if it&#39;s not adultery?</span></p>\n\n<p>Church leaders have struggled with how to characterize such a situation. In fact, just determining when such a relationship has become inappropriate can be difficult (i.e., when is a close relationship between a man and a woman &ldquo;too close?&rdquo;). Therefore to address this ambiguity, some churches invented the term \"spiritual adultery\" to describe a relationship that intimates&nbsp;marital unfaithfulness yet does not involve sexual sin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Is such a label warranted? Is there such a thing as spiritual adultery in this context?</p>\n\n<p>We believe the answer is no. We do not believe the label spiritual adultery is appropriate nor helpful. While we understand the desire to call out such behavior in a strong way, we believe&nbsp;labeling it spiritual adultery is confusing to the church and may lead to unintended consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, sufficient terminology already exists to describe and address the sin(s) involved in excessively-intimate relationships. Lusting, lying and coveting are usually present in any inappropriate relationship, so there is no need to invent new sins to condemn such behavior. Even&nbsp;Jesus Himself equated the seriousness of lust with adultery in Matt 5:28, indicating that the sin of lust is already sufficiently serious to warrant sanctioning within the body.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, adding the word&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;adultery&rdquo; in situations where no sexual sin is present is misleading, unnecessarily inflammatory and invitation for abuse within the church body. The sin of adultery is a serious sexual sin, and it carries significant penalties within the&nbsp;church, including disqualification from leadership and even barring from future marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore when the church uses the word&nbsp;&ldquo;adultery&rdquo; to describe situations where sexual sin is NOT present (even if in a&nbsp;metaphorical sense), the overuse of the term risks diluting the seriousness of literal adultery. Equally troubling, the term&nbsp;&ldquo;adultery&rdquo; opens the door for excessive and inappropriate penalties for those involved in lessor sin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the worst cases, a man or woman&rsquo;s sin might be labeled &ldquo;spiritual adultery&rdquo;&nbsp;as a political ploy. Since literal adultery disqualifies a person from leadership (see 1Tim 3), a nonsexual relationship could be labeled spiritual adultery to&nbsp;justify disqualifying a person from&nbsp;pastoral leadership or&nbsp;eldership,&nbsp;or to deny an individual fellowship within the church body. Such abuse is possible &ndash; if not inevitable &ndash; when the church entertains new, unbiblical&nbsp;classifications for sin.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, the term spiritual&nbsp;adultery is likely to confuse the Church, since the term implies the existence of some&nbsp;new, mysterious category of sin. The congregation can&#39;t know for&nbsp;sure what behaviors will trigger a charge of &nbsp;spiritual adultery, since&nbsp;the Bible offers no definition of the term. Therefore, how&nbsp;can a Christian&nbsp;know when he or she has moved from lusting or coveting into spiritual adultery?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Fourthly, the label of spiritual adultery is contrived, and therefore when we take the concept to its logical conclusion, we reach ridiculous outcomes. For example, should spiritual adultery be subject to the same penalties reserved for literal adultery? If not, why not? Why&nbsp;treat&nbsp;one form of adultery differently than another?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, since spiritual adultery is a sin of desire (not action), are we prepared to judge all sinful thoughts equal to&nbsp;sinful actions? WIll spiritual murder become equal to literal murder,&nbsp;spiritual theft equal to literal theft, and spiritual lying equal to literal lying, etc.?&nbsp;These questions illustrate the inconsistency resulting from contriving such&nbsp;ill-conceived labels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the church should remain constrained by scripture.&nbsp;First, the church should teach spiritual wisdom, including how every spouse must guard his or her heart against the schemes of the enemy,&nbsp;which will test our faithfulness in marriage.&nbsp;Each must be&nbsp;prepared to withstand such temptations taking every opportunity to&nbsp;prepare in advance, including adopting simple rules in marriage like not spending time alone with or&nbsp;communicating privately&nbsp;with&nbsp;someone of the opposite sex, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As James says:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>James 1:14 But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">James 1:15 Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In cases where&nbsp;inappropriate, nonsexual relationship&nbsp;outside marriage&nbsp;are brought to light in the church, leaders&nbsp;should rebuke the couple, demanding confession and repentance, and counseling the individuals involved to consider their behavior in light of their commitments to their spouses and to Christ.</span></p>\n\n<p>If repentance follows, the church should forgive the individual and restore them, as Jesus commanded:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 17:3 &ldquo;Be on your guard! If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 17:4 &ldquo;And if he sins against you seven times a day, and returns to you seven times, saying, &lsquo;I repent,&rsquo; forgive him.&rdquo;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And as Paul commanded, we are to restore the brother who repents in the face of correction:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Gal. 6:1&nbsp; Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Gal. 6:2 Bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">These instructions are sufficient to deal with the sin of an inappropriate relationship. Based on scripture, there is no need to &ldquo;amp up&rdquo; the charge or any corresponding penalties. &nbsp;</span></p>"

For example, the same word is used in this passage referring to a drawing: &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 23:13 &ldquo;I saw that she had defiled herself; they both took the same way.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 23:14 &ldquo;So she increased her harlotries. And she saw men portrayed on the wall, images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 23:15 girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, like the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 23:16 &ldquo;When she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The word translated &ldquo;images&rdquo; in Ezekiel 23:14 is the same Hebrew word as the one used in Genesis 1:26. Notice in the Ezekiel passage that the word was used to describe a drawing or painting on a wall. Drawings are two-dimensional representations of real-life objects, and obviously that depiction were merely reminiscent of the real-life objects they portrayed. A drawing&nbsp;on the wall would never be mistaken for the real object it&nbsp;represents. The drawing and its subject are very different from one another.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So, when Genesis says we were created in the image of God, it isn&rsquo;t saying we are a carbon copy of God or a clone, etc. We are very, very different than God. Nevertheless, we were created to reflective aspects of God, in ways that set us apart from the rest of Creation (which is not made in His image).&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Then in what way(s) do we resemble God? Do&nbsp;we mirror His physical form? As you pointed out, we&nbsp;know this can&rsquo;t be true, because God has no physical form, as scripture says:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John 4:24 &ldquo;God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.&rdquo;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John 1:18&nbsp; No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John 5:37 &ldquo;And the Father who sent Me, He has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form.</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As scripture testifies, God the Father and God the Spirit are all spirit, and therefore He has no physical form. In fact, the Son became flesh so that men could see God in physical form:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John 1:14&nbsp; And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 1:15&nbsp; He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Phil. 2:6 who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Phil. 2:7 but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Phil. 2:8 Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ironically, the Bible says we were created in the likeness of an invisible God, and it says that the invisible God sent His Son in our likeness (i.e., in human flesh) so that we could see Him.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, we must conclude we are created in the likeness of God in terms of sharing aspects of God&rsquo;s character, nature and personality. We have the capacity to love and hate, to obey and to reason. We have the ability to worship Him and know Him in ways nothing else in His creation can equal. Therefore, we are made in His likeness in these ways, not in terms of His appearance (for He has no physical appearance).</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For more detail on how we reflect the image of God, please listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis study</a>, particularly Lesson 1D.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong>Q: Would you classify the Seventh-Day Adventist Church as a cult?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A: The <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cult\">Merriam-Webster Dictionary</a> defines a cult in this way:</p>\n\n<h5>&hellip;\"a small religious group that is not part of a larger and more accepted religion and that has beliefs regarded by many people as extreme or&nbsp;dangerous.\"</h5>\n\n<p>According to this definition, the Seventh Day Adventist Church qualifies as a cult. While they call themselves Christian (and probably many who attend Adventist churches are, in fact, believers in Jesus Christ), the organization itself&nbsp;professes unbiblical and harmful&nbsp;doctrines and beliefs outside the mainstream of orthodox Christianity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Their movement originated in 1836 with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Miller_(preacher)\">William Miller (1782-1849</a>), a false prophet who claimed to know that the second coming of Christ would happen in 1843. When this prediction proved false, many left the movement in a period called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Disappointment\">The Great Disappointment</a>.&rdquo; Given this man&rsquo;s obvious fraud, we might assume&nbsp;his followers would abandon&nbsp;him&nbsp;quickly since he failed the basic <a href=\"/bible-answers/do_the_office_of_apostles_and_prophets_still_exist\">biblical test </a>for&nbsp;the office of prophet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But as Jesus predicted and Peter repeated:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 24:11 &ldquo;Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many.</h5>\n\n<h5>2Pet. 2:1&nbsp; But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Though these circumstances should have put an end to this movement, Adventism continued. After his death, Miller&#39;s followers took to calling themselves &ldquo;Adventists,&rdquo; referring to their anticipation for the second appearing of Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In response to Miller&rsquo;s false prediction, Adventists contrived an explanation for Jesus&rsquo; failure to appear in 1843. The church proposed that Jesus was unable to return because He was&nbsp;engaged in an \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_judgment\">Investigative Judgment</a>\"&nbsp;process&nbsp;of examining all who dwell on the earth to determine who has repented sufficiently to receive the benefit of His atonement. Only after His investigation&nbsp;was complete would Jesus return to the earth, Adventists claimed.</span></p>\n\n<p>Not only is the Adventist doctrine of&nbsp;Investigative Judgment unsupported by scripture, it is <em>contrary</em> to scripture.</p>\n\n<p>First,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Jesus is omniscient, so He&nbsp;always</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;knows the state of every human heart in all history&nbsp;at every moment, so He needs no time to accomplish such a work (<em>see John 2:25)</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Secondly, t</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">he Bible says that the repentance that leads to salvation is a gift from God, <em>not</em> a work of man. As we read in several places, including:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Acts 11:17 &nbsp;&ldquo;Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as He gave to us also after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God&rsquo;s way?&rdquo;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Acts 11:18 &nbsp;When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, &ldquo;Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance that leads to life.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Cor. 7:9 &nbsp;I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Cor. 7:10 &nbsp;For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The&nbsp;work of bringing repentance unto salvation is one \"granted\" us by \"the will of God,\" scripture teaches.&nbsp;Therefore, it is nonsensical to suggest&nbsp;Jesus is tarrying while He&nbsp;\"inspects\" hearts on earth to learn who has sufficiently repented.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Jesus doesn&#39;t need to undertake such an inspection since&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Jesus Himself is the Author and Perfector of our faith, including&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">granting us</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">repentance as He chooses.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Christ is not delaying because He is&nbsp;investigating&nbsp;hearts. In fact, Christ is not delaying at all (<em>see 2Peter 3:9</em>).&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Bible says plainly that the specific timing of Christ&#39;s return will always be </span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">unknowable</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> by any human being, because the timing of His return is entirely dependent on the Father&#39;s will, as Jesus says:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 24:36 &nbsp;&ldquo;But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 24:37 &nbsp;&ldquo;For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah.</span></h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">When the time appointed by the Father arrives, Jesus will return and&nbsp;not a moment sooner nor later. Therefore,&nbsp;William Miller&#39;s prediction of a return in 1843&nbsp;was nothing more than&nbsp;a false claim by a false&nbsp;prophet, and the Adventists invention of the doctrine of Investigative Judgment&nbsp;was an&nbsp;attempt to cover&nbsp;up Miller&#39;s error with still more lies.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Consequently,&nbsp;the Adventist&#39;s core doctrine of Investigative Judgment, upon which the church was founded and from which the church gets its very name, is a false teaching. More importantly, it leads&nbsp;to&nbsp;a false Gospel since it implies a works&nbsp;requirement to be saved. If men must do sufficient repentance in order to obtain Christ&#39;s atonement, then men would be required to accomplish a work to be saved.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Later, the Adventist&nbsp;church recognized another so-called prophet,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_G._White\">Ellen White,</a> who claimed to receive \"visions\" and who&nbsp;the church believed spoke for God (despite the Bible&rsquo;s teaching that no new revelation&nbsp;will come after the <a href=\"/bible-answers/how_do_we_know_the_bible_is_accurate\">canon of scripture closed</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Under the influence of these (likely demonic) visions, White and others in the&nbsp;church invented new, unbiblical concepts&nbsp;of life after death, including the notion that the dead enter a period of <a href=\"http://sogentlybroken.blogspot.com/2008/09/adventist-teaching-on-soul-sleep.html\">soul sleep</a>, where they know nothing. They also taught that no hell exists and that the wicked merely cease to exist at the end of time. Each of these beliefs contradicts the clear teaching of scripture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the&nbsp;Seventh-Day Adventists are best known for their&nbsp;distorted view of the Bible&#39;s teaching on Sabbath. The Bible teaches&nbsp;that faith in Christ is the <a href=\"/how_should_a_christian_approach_the_sabbath\">fulfillment of our Sabbath rest</a>&nbsp;requirement, yet Adventists maintain&nbsp;that Christians must return to observing a literal sabbath day rest on Saturday, which is&nbsp;the Sabbath day for Jews under the Law of Moses. Therefore, the second part of the church&#39;s name (i.e., Seventh-Day)&nbsp;is <em>also</em> rooted in&nbsp;a false teaching.</p>\n\n<p>The Adventists promote other unbiblical and legalistic requirements for their followers, including&nbsp;abstaining from pork and certain other restrictions found in the Levitical&nbsp;Law given to Israel. All of these practices are unnecessary for the New Testament believer,&nbsp;and harmful to our Christian liberty, which Paul calls our \"prize\" in Colossians:</p>\n\n<h5>Col. 2:16 &nbsp;Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day &mdash;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 2:17 things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 2:18 Let no one keep defrauding you of your <strong>prize</strong> by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 2:19 and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 2:20 &nbsp;If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 2:21 &ldquo;Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 2:22 (which all refer to things destined to perish with use) &mdash; in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men?&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Col. 2:23 These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p>The Seventh-Day Adventist&nbsp;teachings concerning living under the Law of Moses are an attempt to reinstitute (selectively) a lifestyle of law-keeping as part of their works-based Gospel,&nbsp;despite the Bible&rsquo;s clear teaching that the <a href=\"/devotionals/on_law_and_liberty_part_1\">New Testament believer is not bound to keep the Law of Moses</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the church&#39;s fraudulent&nbsp;beginnings, false doctrines, legalistic requirements and restrictive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_of_Seventh-day_Adventists\">governing practices</a>&nbsp;lead to the conclusion that the&nbsp;Adventist religion is not orthodox Christianity. It operates as a&nbsp;cult-like organization&nbsp;founded on the teaching of false prophets and holds to views contrary to the plain teaching of scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Though the Seventh-Day Adventist church may count many true Christians among its ranks, those believers have been deceived and are being mistaught concerning the Bible, salvation, eternity and the Christian life.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, w</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">e strongly recommend any believer caught up in Adventism to flee this false church and seek for true&nbsp;Christian fellowship elsewhere, preferably&nbsp;in a</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;church that holds to orthodox,&nbsp;biblical truth.</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, it&#39;s no coincidence that Adventism was founded at about the same time in history and in the same place&nbsp;as three other false churches with similar distorted teaching: <a href=\"/bible-answers/are_mormons_considered_christians\">Mormonism</a>, Christian Science, and <a href=\"/bible-answers/are-the-jehovahs-witnesses-christian\">Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses</a>. This&nbsp;pattern suggests that Satan was at work at one time to establish these false churches in an effort to confuse and mislead new believers during the Great Awakening period of North American Christianity. Together, these four false religions continue to deceive many today.</p>\n\n<p>For a more in-depth expos&eacute;&nbsp;of Adventist heresy compared to orthodox biblical doctrines, we encourage you to visit the website <a href=\"http://sogentlybroken.blogspot.com\">Gently Broken</a>, a blog written by a Christian who was formerly a member of the Adventist religion. &nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: The Bible says we are to anoint a person with oil so they can be healed. How does that work?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA: In the Bible, anointing a person with oil is a ritual symbolizing the anointing (i.e., sanctifying work) of the Holy Spirit. Anointing by oil is a way of representing an otherwise invisible work of the Spirit to heal or commission an individual for service.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We can see this association reflected in the instructions in the Law. Anointing oil is prescribed in the Law of Moses for preparing the tabernacle furnishings for service and for commissioning the priests for service. Later, the prophets and kings were granted authority by an anointing of oil according to God&rsquo;s instructions. For example, when Samuel came to designate David as Saul&rsquo;s successor, we read this:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Sam. 16:12 So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And the LORD said, &ldquo;Arise, anoint him; for this is he.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Sam. 16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Notice that Samuel&rsquo;s anointing of David in oil represented the arrival of the Spirit upon David. The oil itself was not the source of David&rsquo;s power or spiritual authority; rather, the Spirit was responsible for giving David these things. Nevertheless, the oil was a physical representation of the Spirit&rsquo;s arrival and work so that those present with Samuel and David could understand that God was acting on David&#39;s behalf at that moment. Anointing in oil has always conveyed this symbolic meaning.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Likewise, we are commanded at times to anoint others with oil under specific circumstances to reflect our faith in the work of the Spirit. The church is to anoint leaders in anticipation of their work for God and to anoint the sick in anticipation of the Spirit&rsquo;s work to heal them. But in all cases, the actual spiritual work is done by the Spirit, not by the oil, which merely represents the Spirit. In fact, the work of Spirit takes place with or without the anointing of oil.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For example, notice John&rsquo;s statement concerning the anointing of every believer:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1John 2:27 As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1John 2:28&nbsp; Now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John says every believer has the Spirit, which he calls the anointing. &nbsp;So if every believer already possesses the anointing of the Holy Spirit, then we know the anointing of oil is merely a metaphor or picture of the Spirit&rsquo;s anointing. It doesn&rsquo;t cause the Spirit to act nor does it replace the Spirit&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This relationship between anointing with oil and the Spirit&rsquo;s work is similar to the relationship between water baptism and the baptism of the Spirit. The baptism of the Spirit occurs at the moment of our salvation, but water baptism follows later to signify the work of the Spirit. Water baptism can&rsquo;t take the place of the Spirit baptism though it does picture the Spirit&#39;s work.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In the case of anointing the sick, it&rsquo;s important to remember that our act to anoint a person with oil does not bring about their healing.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">James 5:14 Is anyone among you sick? Then he must call for the elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">James 5:15 and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Notice James says that the prayer offered in faith restores the sick, not the anointing itself. Only God can heal, and He only does so when it suits His purposes. Prayer offered in faith is a Spirit-inspired appeal to God for His healing work. The application of oil is a sign of our confidence in God&rsquo;s power to heal and our expectation&nbsp;He will&nbsp;do so at that moment. Our confidence in God&#39;s favor&nbsp;to heal in is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a matter of wishful thinking or reliance on the&nbsp;oil; such confidence can only be inspired by the Holy Spirit. When we are so inspired, we pray and anoint expecting to see God act.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So, when we anoint another person with prayers in faith (i.e., with a Spirit-given confidence that God intends to act according to our request), then our anointing becomes a powerful picture of God&rsquo;s coming work by His Spirit. In this way the</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;function or purpose of anointing with oil is to symbolize the Spirit&rsquo;s work in the life of a person, whether to commission them for service in a specific role or to heal them in a specific sense.&nbsp;</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Why does human suffering exist, especially if God is loving? Why doesn&#39;t Satan repent and put an end to the misery?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A: This is one of the most common spiritual questions people ask (along with what happens after we die?). The answer is both simple and yet profound.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible says that all suffering is the result of sin.&nbsp;All suffering, all grief and misery is ultimately traced to the sin&nbsp;of mankind and the schemes&nbsp;of Satan. More specifically, suffering results from human sinfulness, demonic agency and God&#39;s curse upon the earth (as a result of sin), which conspire together to yield all negative and harmful consequences in Creation<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;consequences of sin are only corrected by the power of Christ. The Bible&nbsp;says those who believe in Christ will be saved from this life in a future day, and in our new glorified bodies we will see the end of our suffering. Later,&nbsp;in the New Heavens and Earth, the Lord will eliminate all pain and suffering brought about by sin and the devil in all Creation:</p>\n\n<h6>Rev. 21:3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rev. 21:4 and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>When the Lord returns and sets up the Kingdom, we will be glorified and our suffering will be over. Once the New Heavens and Earth arrive, all suffering will be ended because all sin and rebellion will be done away with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Until that day arrives, suffering will continue. The Lord is not pleased to see suffering, but He endures it with us waiting for His plan of salvation to play out through all generations. As Peter says in response to those who might criticize Christ&#39;s delay in returning to end suffering:</p>\n\n<h6>2Pet. 3:9 The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Regarding Satan, he cannot repent for the Lord has not granted him repentance. Only when the Lord grants repentance can it happen, as Paul teaches:</p>\n\n<h6>Acts 5:31 &ldquo;He is the one whom God exalted to His right hand as a Prince and a Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Acts 11:18 When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, &ldquo;Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance that leads to life.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>2Cor. 7:9 I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Cor. 7:10 For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>2Tim. 2:25 with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The repentance that leads to salvation and a changed heart is a work done by God Himself in the heart, and unless God grants repentance, a person (or angel) cannot repent. Furthermore, the Bible says it is not in God&rsquo;s plan to grant mercy to fallen angels like Satan:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Heb. 2:16 For assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant of Abraham.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>"

Will I not be able to do that in the Kingdom?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA: Pastor Armstrong&rsquo;s teaching on life in the Kingdom is necessarily limited by what scripture itself provides. Therefore, we must caution against making too many assumptions one way or another about how we will experience the presence of the Lord.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Regarding your comment that the Lord will be out of reach, we encourage you to think differently about the Lord and His presence in general. First, you are in His presence even now, as His Spirit lives within you though we understand you mean His physical presence. Nevertheless, the Spirit living in us has given us the fullness of Christ even now, and in the Kingdom we will have a full appreciation of God.</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 13:12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I also have been fully known.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 13px;\">So, we will gain a greater appreciation of Christ in the Kingdom, however we must be careful not to reduce the Lord, the Creator of the Universe, into little more than our best buddy or a cool guy we admire, etc. </span></h6>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 13px;\">As Hebrews explains:</span></h6>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 10:30 For we know Him who said, &ldquo;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Heb. 10:31 It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Our purpose in pointing out these truths is not to diminish your love and affection for Christ, for He is deserving of all honor and praise and glory. Rather, we want your admiration for Christ to be rooted in an appreciation of Who He is in all respects, including His awesome power and authority and majesty. Christ appeared in humble form once, but the time for a humble appearance has past:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Zech. 9:9&nbsp; &nbsp;Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem!</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Behold, your king is coming to you;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">He is just and endowed with salvation,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Humble, and mounted on a donkey,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Zech. 9:10&nbsp; &nbsp;I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And the horse from Jerusalem;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And the bow of war will be cut off.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And He will speak peace to the nations;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And His dominion will be from sea to sea,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And from the River to the ends of the earth.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Notice in v.9, Zechariah described the first appearing of the Lord in a humble form. Then in v.10, Zechariah describes Christ&rsquo;s Second Coming when He rules in the Kingdom. In His second appearing, He rules the earth, and as Lord over the earth, Jesus will be majestic and receiving of all honor He is due. If we bow before earthly kings and give them great deference and honor, will we not do even more for the Lord of Creation when He enters into His Kingdom?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">While we understand your hope for a &ldquo;personal&rdquo; moment with the Lord, we encourage you to consider you have that intimacy with Christ even now by His Spirit, and you will know Him even more fully in the age to come. At the same time, we will honor Him as the King He is, and this is how it ought to be.</span></p>"

We&#39;ve attended for a time, but we don&#39;t see any reason to go through a membership process. Aren&#39;t all believers part of the church by faith alone? Also, my church pressures people to join the church by&nbsp;claiming that church members possess&nbsp;a higher degree of the spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this true? Should I join the church?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA: First, <em><strong>becoming </strong></em>part of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Body of Christ (i.e., the Church) happens at the moment of faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">All believers are made part of one Body by faith alone, according to Paul in Ephesians:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Eph. 4:4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Eph. 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Eph. 4:6 one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Therefore, no human process is prescribed nor necessary for establishing a believer in the Church. By faith alone, we become part of the Body of Christ, spiritually speaking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">On the other hand, gaining <em><strong>access</strong></em> to</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;fellowship with</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;other</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;believers depends on a Christian taking a step&nbsp;of obedience in keeping with scripture. Specifically, submission</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;to&nbsp;water baptism&nbsp;is the Bible&#39;s requirement for how a Christian may enjoy the fellowship</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;of believers.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">A review of the <a href=\"/bible-studies/acts_of_the_apostles\">book of Acts</a> reveals that submitting to water baptism was the expected evidence of faith required for every new believer in the early church.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Until a believer agreed to water baptism, the church could deny the person fellowship because the person&#39;s commitment to Christ was in doubt until he or she&nbsp;took this necessary first step of faith. Since persecution in the early church&nbsp;often came from spies within the congregation, churches&nbsp;often demanded newcomers submit to Christ&#39;s command for a public water baptism as proof of their confession.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Consequently, there is nothing automatically wrong or unbiblical in&nbsp;establishing a formal&nbsp;&ldquo;membership&rdquo; process for joining a local congregation,&nbsp;provided the requirements for membership are consistent with the Bible&rsquo;s teaching concerning entering into the body of Christ. C</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">onfession of Christ and submission to water baptism are minimum requirements for joining in fellowship with a local church, and if a membership process focuses on these steps, it</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;can serve a useful purpose in helping&nbsp;establish new believers within a body. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For example, a church membership process could include asking new participants in the church to provide&nbsp;a personal testimony of faith in Christ to confirm&nbsp;their salvation. Likewise, the process could require that newcomers&nbsp;submit to water baptism if the ordinance has&nbsp;not already been performed.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>These steps are in keeping with the Bible&#39;s teaching for how believers enter into the fellowship with other saints. In fact, e<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">very church should take steps to ensure these requirements for fellowship have been met by all who express an interest in joining with&nbsp;believers in a church.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Going beyond these two requirements, a membership process might also ask newcomers to make various pledges, including pledging&nbsp;submission to church authority. When a person expresses a desire to&nbsp;congregate with other believers, he implies a&nbsp;willingness to submit to the elders&#39; leadership in that local body, therefore&nbsp;asking the newcomer&nbsp;to acknowledge the spiritual authority of church leaders publicly&nbsp;is reasonable. In return, the leadership might&nbsp;pledge&nbsp;to care for the spiritual needs of the new member. This is a healthy way to establish new relationships in the church.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from these basic requirements, however,&nbsp;a church should avoid&nbsp;instituting other&nbsp;requirements &nbsp;(e.g., extracting commitments of&nbsp;financial support, etc.). Biblically speaking, the&nbsp;purpose&nbsp;of a membership process should be limited to verifying the&nbsp;spiritual state of newcomers and facilitating entry&nbsp;into the body&nbsp;in a healthy and responsible manner &ndash; not to coerce&nbsp;or pressure people into giving money or to place other burdens on them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your specific circumstances,<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;the comments you shared regarding your current church concern us greatly. The leadership in your church appears&nbsp;to be drifting away from sound doctrine and into mystical beliefs or&nbsp;cynical methods of coercing financial giving within your church. In either case, we see good reason to flee from this unhealthy situation, and perhaps the Lord is closing doors to persuade you to make the necessary change.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: Most of the Old Testament seems directed to the nation of Israel. What part of the Old Testament is applicable for Gentile believers?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">First, the Gentiles had little or no relationship to God in the years prior to Jesus&#39; incarnation, as Paul explains:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Eph. 2:11&nbsp;Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called &ldquo;Uncircumcision&rdquo; by the so-called &ldquo;Circumcision,&rdquo; which is performed in the flesh by human hands &mdash;&nbsp;<br />\nEph. 2:12&nbsp;remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.&nbsp;<br />\nEph. 2:13&nbsp;But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.&nbsp;<br />\nEph. 2:14&nbsp;For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,&nbsp;<br />\nEph. 2:15&nbsp;by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace,&nbsp;<br />\nEph. 2:16&nbsp;and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nPrior to the advent of the Church age at Pentecost, the Gentile world was largely excluded from the grace of God. While a few Gentiles were offered opportunity to enter into the assembly of God&rsquo;s people in Israel (i.e., Ruth, Rahab, etc.), the vast majority of Gentiles were &ldquo;excluded&rdquo; from the commonwealth of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Once Christ appeared, the New Covenant was inaugurated in His blood, and all believers (Jew and Gentile) are united in one body by faith during the Church age.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Nevertheless, all who have been united by God&rsquo;s grace in the New Covenant benefit from the entirety of God&rsquo;s word, both Old and New testament.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">All of God&rsquo;s word is beneficial to our spiritual growth and relationship with the Lord. As Paul says:</span></p>\n\n<h6><br />\n2Tim. 3:16&nbsp;All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;&nbsp;<br />\n2Tim. 3:17&nbsp;so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nWhile many commands found in Old Testament scripture will not apply directly to Gentiles (i.e., the Law of Moses), nevertheless study of these scriptures still benefits a Gentile believer in the New Covenant. Among other benefits, we learn about the work of God in previous ages and with other peoples, we learn about promises made concerning future events, we learn God&rsquo;s standards for holiness, and we learn about Christ, Who is pictured in these things.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>During the Last Supper, Jesus pledged to not drink wine again until the Kingdom. But on the cross, Jesus consumed sour wine. Did Jesus break His pledge?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nIn Luke 22 we read:</p>\n\n<h6>Luke 22:17&nbsp;And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He said, &ldquo;Take this and share it among yourselves;<br />\nLuke 22:18&nbsp;for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nBut in John&#39;s Gospel we are told:</p>\n\n<h6>John 19:28 &nbsp;After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture,&nbsp; said, &ldquo;I am thirsty.&rdquo;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">John 19:29 &nbsp;A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine upon a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>So did Jesus violate His promise when He took the sour wine on the cross? No, and to understand why, we need to take a closer examination of the Last Supper Passover meal itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In the Passover meal, traditionally four cups of wine were taken as part of the Seder ceremony. At the Last Supper Passover meal, Jesus drank from the first and second cups, but when he reached the moment to drink the third cup of wine (called the cup of redemption), He declined. Instead, He passed this cup to the disciples as Luke records, and told them to drink of His &ldquo;blood,&rdquo; which would be poured out to redeem men from their sins.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>At that moment, Jesus symbolically associated the wine of the third cup with His spilled blood on the cross. Since Jesus Himself had no sin of His own, He declined to drink&nbsp;from that third cup at the meal because He had no need to redeem Himself. Instead, only the disciples drank the third cup because Jesus&#39;&nbsp;blood was spilled to redeem them (and us).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Following the third cup, Jesus stated He will not drink wine again until He reaches the Kingdom. Jesus wasn&rsquo;t pledging to never consumer wine in any form since we see He consumed a tiny portion on the cross.&nbsp;Such a pledge would have served no spiritual purpose.&nbsp;Instead, Jesus was speaking specifically about refraining from drinking the fourth cup of wine served during the Passover meal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jesus did not drink the fourth cup at the Passover table (neither did the disciples). Instead, that meal was suspended at the point of drinking the third cup. The fourth cup will not be consumed until the inauguration of the Kingdom. Notice what Jesus spoke as that meal began:</p>\n\n<h6>Luke 22:15&nbsp;And He said to them, &ldquo;I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;<br />\nLuke 22:16&nbsp;for I say to you, I shall never again eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nJesus said the meal would be \"fulfilled\" (i.e., completed) in the Kingdom. This statement tells us that the Last Supper continues to be underway until the Kingdom. In that way, Jesus&#39; final Passover meal was&nbsp;intended to establish the Last Supper observance as a bridge connecting His death to His return to establish the Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>Since Jesus death, the Church&#39;s observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper has &ldquo;replayed\" the moment Jesus passed the third cup around the table to His disciples. Each time Christians participate in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, we remember that we await the Lord&rsquo;s return and the moment we will drink the fourth cup of wine with Him in the Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As Paul taught:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 11:26&nbsp;For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice Paul reiterates that the Last Supper meal bridges the period between the Lord&rsquo;s death and His return. Paul mentions &ldquo;the cup&rdquo; of the meal referring to the third cup Jesus passed to His disciples. In a symbolic sense, every believer who partakes of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is sharing in the third cup that Jesus passed to those first disciples at that Passover table.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So we can say that the third cup of Jesus&#39; Passover meal has continued to pass from believer to believer across many generations. Jesus refused to take the fourth cup at that meal because had the fourth cup been served, then the meal would have ended. Instead, Jesus ensured&nbsp;that meal continues uninterrupted by our continued observance of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At Jesus&rsquo; Second Coming and the inauguration of the Kingdom, a banquet table will be set and wine will be served. At that table, Jesus will finally enjoy the fourth cup of wine, which He declined during the Last Supper meal.&nbsp;(The wedding feast parable that begins Matthew 22 is a description of this coming banquet.)</p>\n\n<p>Notice this same scene described in Matthew:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 26:27&nbsp;And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink from it, all of you;<br />\nMatt. 26:28&nbsp;for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.<br />\nMatt. 26:29&nbsp;&ldquo;But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nIn Matthew&rsquo;s account, Jesus specifically says that He will drink the fourth cup &ldquo;with you,&rdquo; referring to the disciples. So once the Church is resurrected and present with Jesus in the Kingdom to come, then we will all participate with Jesus in a banquet (The feast of Tabernacles) and we will enjoy the fourth cup of wine with Him.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Jesus&rsquo; pledge in Luke 22 during the Last Supper did not refer to abstaining from all wine generally. Rather, Jesus was speaking of refraining from the fourth cup of wine in the Passover feast until His return and the start of the Kingdom. Therefore, Jesus taking of sour wine (actually vinegar) on the cross was not a contradiction since His taste of the vine at that moment was not the fourth cup of the Passover meal. Jesus has kept His promise not to take that cup without us present.</p>\n\n<p>So, during the 2,000+ years since Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection, the Church has been waiting for the resumption of that Passover meal, which will occur when we participate with Jesus in drinking that fourth cup of wine at the start of the Kingdom. The fourth cup of the Passover meal is traditionally called the cup of thanksgiving, and we will certainly be thanking the Lord for the Kingdom on the day we drink it with Him!</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q: In John 20, Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit upon the disciples, but later in Acts we find Pentecost. In which moment did the disciples receive the Holy Spirit?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;In John 20, we read:</p>\n\n<h6>John 20:22 &nbsp;And when He had said this, He breathed on them and&nbsp;&nbsp;said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nJesus performed this work upon 10 of the eleven disciples (Thomas was not present). Was this the moment that these ten men received the indwelling of the Spirit, as Christ promised to them in the Upper Room discourse?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Apparently not, because in Acts we read:</p>\n\n<h6>Acts 1:2&nbsp;until the day when He was taken up to heaven, after He had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen.&nbsp;<br />\nActs 1:3&nbsp;To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.&nbsp;<br />\nActs 1:4&nbsp;Gathering them together, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had promised, &ldquo;Which,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;you heard of from Me;<br />\nActs 1:5&nbsp;for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&rdquo;<br />\nActs 1:6&nbsp; So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nActs 1:7&nbsp;He said to them, &ldquo;It is not for you to know times or epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority;<br />\nActs 1:8&nbsp;but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo;<br />\nActs 1:9&nbsp;And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice this scene involves the apostles, as Luke says in v.2. The apostles were the same men as those present in John 20, so whatever Jesus did in John 20, we know He did NOT give the apostles a permanent indwelling of the Spirit at this moment, otherwise the Spirit would not have come again to them in Acts 2.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Notice in Acts 1:8 Jesus speaks in the future tense about the coming of the Spirit to these men. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, the Spirit could not come upon these men prior to Pentecost because the Jewish feast of Pentecost is fulfilled by the Spirit&rsquo;s arrival to the Church. The Law was given to Israel at Mt. Sinai 50 days after the first Passover and Israel&#39;s</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;exodus from Egypt. Likewise, the law of God is written on the hearts of believers 50 days after the sacrifice of Christ, our Passover.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">That feast could not be fulfilled prematurely, just as Jesus could not have died on the cross a day sooner than Passover. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, how do we interpret the events of John 20? In all probability,&nbsp;Jesus was giving His disciples a symbolic and&nbsp;memorable introduction to the Spirit, Who was to come upon them&nbsp;later. This moment was a&nbsp;demonstration of what Jesus would do at Pentecost&nbsp;after He returned to&nbsp;the Father.</p>\n\n<p>Breath is often a picture of the Spirit (in fact, the Hebrew word for Spirit is also the word for breath), so Jesus&nbsp;&ldquo;breathed&rdquo;&nbsp;on the men while He was standing with them in His physical presence&nbsp;to indicate what He was preparing to do later by the&nbsp;Spirit.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, Jesus was not imparting the&nbsp;Spirit to&nbsp;them in John 20 in any real sense. He was promising to do so later at Pentecost.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Remember,&nbsp;Thomas was not present at the moment, so had the Spirit been given as some might argue, how then would we explain&nbsp;Thomas&rsquo; absence?&nbsp;Did he not receive the Spirit? This dilemma is solved by concluding the Spirit was not&nbsp;involved in this moment, expect as symbolized by Jesus&rsquo; breath. It also explains why this&nbsp;event had&nbsp;no permanent impact on the disciples comparable to&nbsp;that of Pentecost.</span></p>\n\n<p>Evidently there was only one coming of the Spirit on&nbsp;these&nbsp;disciples, and that happened on Pentecost.</p>"

Faith and trust in the word of God<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;leads us away from such teaching and toward Jesus Christ as our Savior.&nbsp;Reincarnation and similar teaching about life after death are pagan beliefs concerning life and death and judgment.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>The Bible is clear about the course of every human being&rsquo;s life:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 9:27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment,<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Every human being is created by God in what womb as a physical body with an accompanying spirit. This is the beginning of every human being&rsquo;s existence. At the death of the body, the spirit falls is subject to God&#39;s judgment. If a person has not believed in Christ while alive, then their spirit will enter everlasting punishment. There is no &ldquo;second earthly life&rdquo; or reincarnation for a human being. All unbelievers will experience the Second Death, as scripture calls it:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nRev. 20:12&nbsp;And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 20:13&nbsp;And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 20:14&nbsp;Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 20:15&nbsp;And if anyone&rsquo;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nReincarnation and former &ldquo;lives&rdquo; are deceptions delivered by the enemy and his demons to confuse mankind concerning the truth of life and death. If the enemy can deceive us into assuming we live again without faith in Jesus Christ, then he can blind the minds of unbelievers to the need for Christ and the Gospel.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You will find the following articles and teachings useful in understanding this matter more fully:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/question_on_life_after_death\">Life after death</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/explain_where_we_go_when_we_die\">Where do we go when we die?</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/will_unbelievers_get_a_second_chance\">Will unbelievers get a second chance?</a></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q: I have a friend who used to attend&nbsp;a Mormon church and was baptized there. Later, she left the Mormon religion and joined a Christian church.&nbsp;She says she was a true believer in Christ when she received her Mormon baptism, but she wonders if that baptism qualifies as a Christian baptism?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>First, we need to understand the differences between&nbsp;the&nbsp;false teachings of the Mormon church concerning the Gospel and water baptism and the proper,&nbsp;biblical perspective on these matters.</p>\n\n<p>Water baptism is an ordinance the Lord prescribed for His Church so we would testify to the world concerning our faith in Christ. When a believer submits to water baptism, they make a public confession (by their words and actions) of faith in the Gospel.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, a believer testifies that Jesus died on the cross in his place as payment for sin (which is pictured by being &ldquo;buried&rdquo; in the water), and that by faith he will be resurrected with Christ in a future day (which is pictured by being raised up out of the water).&nbsp;Every person who believes in the Gospel of Jesus Christ is commanded by Jesus to take part in water baptism as a testimony of this belief.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Regrettably, the Mormon church does not hold to these truths.&nbsp;They do not believe that faith alone in Christ&rsquo;s death is the one and only means to&nbsp;eternal life, nor do they understand water baptism to be a picture of our salvation. Instead, they teach that eternal life is earned through a life of sinless works (water baptism being the first work required for salvation), and they teach that water baptism pictures a person&rsquo;s commitment to becoming sinless and earning their salvation.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote on water baptism taken from an <a href=\"http://www.mormon.org/faq/baptism-beliefs\">official Mormon website</a>:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<pre>\n&ldquo;We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by&#10;obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel&rdquo; (Articles of Faith 1:3). &#10;Baptism in water is an ordinance essential to our salvation. By being baptized,&#10;we show God that we are willing to be obedient to His commandments. Jesus set &#10;the example for us by being baptized, even though He was without sin (see &#10;Mosiah 18:8-10). The Savior revealed the proper method of baptism to the Prophet&#10;Joseph Smith, making clear that the ordinance must be performed by one having &#10;priesthood authority and that it be done by immersion (see Doctrine and &#10;Covenants 20:72-74).&#10;&#10;<span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">Immersion is symbolic of the death of a person&rsquo;s sinful life and the rebirth &#10;into a spiritual life, dedicated to the service of God and His children. It is &#10;also symbolic of death and resurrection. (See Romans 6:3-6)...&#10;</span>&#10;</pre>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nFirst, the quote says Mormons believe all mankind will be saved&nbsp;by obedience to the laws and ordinances of God. In other words, Mormons profess to trust in their own works to bring them into eternal life. The quote also explains that Mormons believe water baptism is one of the required works for salvation.&nbsp;Also, notice that Mormons assign a false symbolic meaning to water baptism. They state that water&nbsp;baptism symbolizes the death&nbsp;of a person&rsquo;s \"sinful life\" and a&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;to obeying and serving God.</p>\n\n<p>Mormon views&nbsp;on the purpose and meaning of water baptism and on the Gospel itself&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">are contradicted by the Bible.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;First, the Bible teaches that water baptism is a testimony of our clear conscience made possible by Christ&rsquo;s redemptive work done on our behalf, not a testimony of our commitment to work for Him.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h6>1Pet. 3:20 &nbsp; &nbsp;who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water.&nbsp;<br />\n1Pet. 3:21 &nbsp; Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you &mdash; not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience &mdash; through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Notice Peter clarifies in v.21 that the baptism that saves a person is NOT the one that removes dirt from the flesh (i.e., water baptism), but it is the baptism that accompanies our appeal to God for a good conscience (i.e., the Spirt baptism that takes place at the moment we repent and believe in the true Gospel). &nbsp;Notice also that Peter says that our salvation is accomplished &ldquo;through the resurrection of Jesus Christ&rdquo; and not by our works.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the Bible teaches that believers are to submit to water baptism&nbsp;<em>because&nbsp;we have been saved</em>, not as a means to being saved, since no works are involved in the salvation offered through faith in Jesus Christ:</p>\n\n<h6>Eph. 2:8 &nbsp; For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;&nbsp;<br />\nEph. 2:9 &nbsp; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Ironically, the Mormon perspective on salvation and baptism&nbsp;is literally 180&ordm; opposite from the biblical truth. Mormons have taken the Gospel of grace through faith in Christ and perverted it into a system of earning salvation through meaningless and useless works. They have&nbsp;distorted water&nbsp;baptism&#39;s beautiful testimony of&nbsp;Christ&#39;s death and resurrection assigned to us by faith&nbsp;into a boastful&nbsp;claim to live&nbsp;sinlessly in earning&nbsp;God&#39;s favor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Mormons also misrepresent the relationship between water baptism and Spirit baptism. The&nbsp;following quote (also taken from the&nbsp;mormon.org&nbsp;website) reveals how Mormon teach that the Holy Spirit doesn&rsquo;t indwell the believer&nbsp;until&nbsp;after&nbsp;water baptism takes place (which is false), and therefore they consider water baptism a &ldquo;gate&rdquo; (i.e., the first step on a path of works) leading to Heaven:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<pre>\nBaptism is the first and an essential Ordinance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.&#10;The first principles and ordinances of the gospel are 1. Faith in the Lord Jesus&#10;Christ, 2. Repentance, 3. Baptism by Immersion for the remission of sins &amp; 4. &#10;Receiving the Gift of the Holy Ghost (which comes only after Baptism)&hellip;.Baptism &#10;is the gate to the strait and narrow path that to be taken in the Gospel. It is&#10;only your first steps in the Gospel.&#10;&#8203;</pre>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nNotice again that Mormons claim water baptism is &ldquo;only your first step in the Gospel,&rdquo; meaning it is merely the&nbsp;first work required to earn entrance to Heaven. This is a false Gospel and anything BUT the good news of salvation by faith in Christ. The s<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">aints saved by faith alone</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;(like Abraham and the thief on the cross)&nbsp;stand as witnesses against the Mormons&#39;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;false teaching on baptism and the Holy Spirit.</span></p>\n\n<p>Suffice to say the Mormon religion is a false church preaching a false Gospel, which saves no one even as it persuades millions into placing their hope in a dark deception. Though individual Mormons can be very sincere in their beliefs and practices, sincerity is not a substitute for the truth, and unless and until a Mormon escapes the false teaching of their institution and comes to know the true Gospel, they will perish in their sins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So given the meaningful differences between Mormonism and Christianity, we believe your friend should pursue a baptism in a Christian church.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Her prior \"baptism\" was a Mormon ceremony signifying agreement with Mormon teaching and submission to the Mormon religious system. It was pagan ritual, and even though the Mormon &ldquo;baptism\" may look like a true Christian baptism (i.e., both rituals involve submerging a person under water), this similarly does not mean the two experiences are interchangeable.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Many (if not all) false religions use water in rituals of one kind or another. Nevertheless, we should no more accept a Mormon washing as a substitute for a Christian baptism than we would&nbsp;accept a washing performed under Buddhism or Islam.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Remember, the spiritual value of water baptism rests entirely upon the meaning we assign to the ritual. Since Mormons&nbsp;assign false meaning to their ritual, a Mormon baptism holds no value for a Christian. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, we must conclude that your friend&rsquo;s participation in the Mormon ritual was not a Christian baptism, even if she was a professing Christian at the time. W</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">e urge you to explain these things to your friend patiently and with love in the hope she will willingly submit to a true, Christian water baptism. We believe it will be a wonderful opportunity for her to witness to the faithfulness of God to bring her out from under the false religion of Mormonism and into the truth of His word.</span></p>"

What about my Christian children and spouse who are&nbsp;not Jewish?</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A: According to Paul, a believing Jew in the church is considered part of the remnant of Israel:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 11:2 God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 11:3 &ldquo;Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 11:4 But what is the divine response to him? &ldquo;I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 11:5 In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God&rsquo;s gracious choice.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>As a Jew and believer in Jesus as Messiah, you are a part of the remnant of Israel by God&rsquo;s gracious choice, Paul says.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, the word says that in the Kingdom, all Jews will live in the Promised Land:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 34:11&nbsp; For thus says the Lord GOD, &ldquo;Behold, I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 34:12 &ldquo;As a shepherd cares for his herd in the day when he is among his scattered sheep, so I will care for My sheep and will deliver them from all the places to which they were scattered on a cloudy and gloomy day.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 34:13 &ldquo;I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them to their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the land.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 34:14 &ldquo;I will feed them in a good pasture, and their grazing ground will be on the mountain heights of Israel. There they will lie down on good grazing ground and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Regarding your spouse and children, they are not considered Jewish according to scripture since their father is not Jewish. We can see an example of this in Ezra when Samaritans visited the Israelites in Jerusalem:</p>\n\n<h6>Ezra 4:1&nbsp; Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the people of the exile were building a temple to the LORD God of Israel,&nbsp;<br />\nEzra 4:2 they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers&rsquo; households, and said to them, &ldquo;Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nEzra 4:3 But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers&rsquo; households of Israel said to them, &ldquo;You have nothing in common with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves will together build to the LORD God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia has commanded us.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>These imposters were long-lost descendants of the Jewish people who had escaped capture when the Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom of Israel. Because these Jewish refugees had intermarried with the&nbsp;Assyrians, they were no longer considered Jewish, as Zerubbabel&rsquo;s repudiation indicates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, your family must be considered Gentiles since they do not have a Jewish father. Nevertheless, they are believers, so they will also be in the Kingdom with you though they will occupy a Gentile land while you live in Israel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t let this difference cause you concern, since it won&rsquo;t matter to us where we live or where members of our earthly family reside. Jesus says we will not be married nor will earthly relationships continue in our glorified state. Instead, we will be like the angels Jesus says speaking of all saints:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 22:30 &ldquo;For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Therefore, it matters not which land we occupy in the Kingdom. Our family associations are dissolved in any case after the resurrection, so that the only family association we have or desire in the Kingdom will be as a brother or sister to all believers and as a Bride to our Groom, Christ.</p>"

                "body": "<p><br />\n<em><strong>Q: Is it Biblical for pastors, Bible teachers, and Christian authors to earn money from their materials?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A:&nbsp;The Bible teaches two principles concerning receiving financial gain from teaching the word of God. First, the Bible says that it is wrong for a teacher or pastor to &ldquo;peddle\" the word of God:</p>\n\n<h6>2Cor. 2:17&nbsp;For we are not like many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Paul says he taught or delivered the word of God to the Church from a heart of sincerity \"as from God.\" In other words, Paul&rsquo;s motivation in bringing the word of God was out of sincere desire to serve God&rsquo;s people as a representative sent by God. Paul was obeying God&rsquo;s command to preach and teach the Gospel, as he says:</p>\n\n<h6><br />\n1Cor. 9:16&nbsp;For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for I am under compulsion; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel. &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>In 2Cor 2:17, Paul contrasts his motive with the motives of those who &ldquo;peddle\" the word of God. Peddling means selling something as a business venture. If a person&rsquo;s motive for delivering God&rsquo;s word is merely for personal financial gain, then they are peddling the word of God. They have turned their teaching ministry from a service to God and His people and into a business venture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>No ministry or pastor may operate under this motive, for when they do so, they run the risk of piercing themselves with many griefs, as Paul wrote:</p>\n\n<h6>1Tim. 6:9&nbsp;But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 6:10&nbsp;For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>So, a pastor or teacher who views his teaching ministry as a for-profit business should leave the pulpit and be removed from teaching. They are no longer serving God; they are only serving themselves. Remember Peter&rsquo;s warning concerning men who use ministry for financial gain:</p>\n\n<h6>2Pet. 2:14&nbsp;having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart trained in greed, accursed children;&nbsp;<br />\n2Pet. 2:15&nbsp;forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>The second principle of scripture we must remember is that those who serve the body of Christ in teaching have a right to receive their living from that work, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h6>1Tim. 5:17&nbsp; The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 5:18&nbsp;For the Scripture says, &ldquo;YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The laborer is worthy of his wages.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 9:7&nbsp;Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock?&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 9:8&nbsp; I am not speaking these things according to human judgment, am I? Or does not the Law also say these things?&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 9:9&nbsp;For it is written in the Law of Moses, &ldquo;YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING.&rdquo; God is not concerned about oxen, is He?&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 9:10&nbsp;Or is He speaking altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops.<br />\n1Cor. 9:11&nbsp;If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 9:12&nbsp;If others share the right over you, do we not more? Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 9:13&nbsp;Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the food of the temple, and those who attend regularly to the altar have their share from the altar?&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 9:14&nbsp;So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>So according to scripture, we&nbsp;cannot fault a man for earning a reasonable living from preaching or teaching God&rsquo;s word. The Bible says such a person is worthy of our support (even double honor!). We must support those who teach us as a reflection of our thankfulness to the Lord for providing their instruction.</p>\n\n<p>Each person will be judged by the Lord. We&nbsp;will be judged by whether we honored our teachers appropriately, while pastors and teachers who teach us will be judged according to&nbsp;their motives and how they handled the word of God.&nbsp;</p>"

And its end will come with a flood; even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The angel Gabriel tells Daniel that the seventy weeks (i.e., 490 years) begins with&nbsp;an issuing of a decree to rebuild the city of Jerusalem, which was destroyed after Babylon conquered Judah.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we&#39;re told that 49 years (i.e. seven sevens or 7 x&nbsp;7)&nbsp;must pass after the decree is issued before construction on the city and walls will be finished, which happens under <a href=\"/bible-studies/nehemiah\">Nehemiah&rsquo;s</a> leadership. The decree that meets this description&nbsp;was issued by Cyrus the Great as described in 2Chronicles 36:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">2Chr. 36:22&nbsp; Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia &mdash; in order to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah &mdash; the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he sent a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">2Chr. 36:23&nbsp;&ldquo;Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, &lsquo;The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has appointed me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all His people, may the LORD his God be with him, and let him go up!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice this decree was the one to \"fulfill the word of the Lord.\" Also,&nbsp;it is specifically&nbsp;issued by Cyrus, who Isaiah named&nbsp;as the one who would issue the required decree&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-studies/isaiah\">Isaiah 44:28)</a>. Clearly, Cyrus&#39; decree must be&nbsp;the one described in Daniel 9:25.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This decree was issued in the \"first year\" of Cyrus the Great. Therefore, the year Cyrus the Great assumed&nbsp;the throne of Persia&nbsp;must be our starting point for counting the 69 weeks or&nbsp;483 years.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Daniel 9:26 says that the end point of the 69 weeks (i.e., 483 years) is the moment the Messiah is cut off and has \"nothing.\" Any fair reading of those words must conclude this to be a reference to Messiah&rsquo;s death on the cross. The Hebrew word translated &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; means to kill or to make a covenant (since the forming of a covenant required the shedding of blood). Therefore, the end of the 483 years is the year Jesus dies on the cross.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the biblical record, <a href=\"/bible-answers/what-date-did-jesus-die\">we can determine</a> that&nbsp;Jesus was born between 6-5&nbsp;BC and died in AD 27.&nbsp;If we count backward from AD 27 by 483 years, we arrive at 456&nbsp;BC as the year Cyrus the Great ascended the throne and issued his decree.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Problem solved? </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Unfortunately, no, because our modern calendar claims the reign of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great\">Cyrus the Great began in 538 BC</a>, which adds 82 years to our timeline. According to <a href=\"http://www.livius.org/articles/concept/ptolemys-canon/?\" target=\"_blank\">Ptolemy&rsquo;s Canon</a> (the basis for our calendar of ancient kings and empires), 566 years passed between Cyrus&rsquo; decree and Jesus&rsquo; death, not 483 years.</span></p>\n\n<p>Over the centuries, biblical scholars have sought to resolve this difference by &ldquo;moving the goal posts\" (i.e., proposing new starting and ending points for the events in Daniel&rsquo;s prophecy). By assigning new meaning to the angel&rsquo;s words in Daniel 9, they&#39;ve arrived at various &ldquo;solutions\" that reduce or even eliminate the 82-year discrepancy.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, some assert that the decree mentioned in Daniel 9:25 was issued by one of Cyrus&rsquo; successors rather than by Cyrus the Great. Others assume different years for Christ&rsquo;s birth and death. Still others interpret the term &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; from Daniel 9:26 to mean something other than Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>\n\n<p>In adjusting these assumptions, scholars creatively seek for a reconciliation, yet most scholars seem unwilling to consider another possible explanation...<em>what if Ptolemy&rsquo;s canon is wrong?</em>&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThough it is not a popular theory, some scholars propose that it&rsquo;s not the Bible&rsquo;s chronology that&rsquo;s wrong, but the historical timeline based on Ptolemy&rsquo;s canon that is in error. In other words, Cyrus the Great did ascend to his throne in 456&nbsp;BC as 2Chronicles 36, Ezra and Daniel report and <em><strong>not</strong></em> in 538 BC as the&nbsp;Ptolemaic chronology claims.</p>\n\n<p>In reviewing the origins of our modern calendar, some scholars find good reason to hold the Ptolemaic chronology in doubt. To quote <a href=\"http://www.biblicalresearch.info/Messiah_His_First_Coming_Scheduled.pdf\">Dr. David Cooper</a>:</p>\n\n<pre>\nPtolemy (A.D. 70-161) was a great constructive genius. He was the &#10;author of the Ptolemaic System of Astronomy. He was one of the founders &#10;of the Science of Geography. But in Chronology he was only a late compiler &#10;and contriver, not an original witness, and not a contemporary historian,&#10;for he lived in the 2nd Century after Christ. He is the only authority for &#10;the Chronology of this period. He is not corroborated. He is contradicted, &#10;both by the Persian National Traditions preserved in Firdusi, by the Jewish &#10;National Traditions preserved in the Sedar Olam, and by the writings of Josephus.</pre>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">While Ptolemy&#39;s&nbsp;dating of events following Alexander the Great is&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">generally&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">considered to be accurate, his proposed dates for earlier events are suspect at best. Dr. Cooper documents Ptolemy&#39;s&nbsp;errors in detail. Nevertheless,&nbsp;Ptolemy&rsquo;s Canon remains the basis for our modern calendar.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>If we allow for the possibility that Ptolemy&rsquo;s dates for events prior to the Greek Empire may be wrong, then we are free to propose the Bible&rsquo;s chronology as an alternative. In that case, no reconciliation would be required. We simply count history in biblical terms and explain that our modern calendar differs from the biblical account due to errors in Ptolemy&rsquo;s assumptions. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Though such a solution may not be satisfying, it is not unprecedented. For example, many Christians attempt to reconcile the Creation account with the modern theory of Evolution, when no such reconciliation is possible. The two explanations of origins are mutually exclusive points of view. Therefore, if we believe the testimony of Scripture, we must reject the world&rsquo;s teaching on origins out of hand and accept the biblical account of Creation instead (though there is great <a href=\"/videos/evolution-exposed\">scientific support for the Creation account</a> as well.)<br />\n<br />\nLikewise, we should accept the Bible&rsquo;s timeline in Daniel to be the accurate record of history, while dismissing the Ptolemaic chronology as containing human error.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Q: Was&nbsp;John the Baptist actually Elijah? Please explain Matthew 11:14&nbsp;when Jesus is speaking about John.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA:&nbsp;First, Elijah the prophet is foretold by Malachi to return to the earth prior to the &ldquo;great and terrible day of the Lord:&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h6>Mal. 4:5&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD.&nbsp;<br />\nMal. 4:6&nbsp;&ldquo;He will restore the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, so that I will not come and smite the land with a curse.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nThe \"great and terrible day of the Lord\" is a reference to the seven years of Tribulation. So, prior to the start of Tribulation, Elijah will return to the earth. The Lord&rsquo;s purpose in bringing Elijah back will be to restore the hearts of Israel, which means to bring Israel back to a true obedience to the word of God, specifically their Law.&nbsp;<br />\nElijah&rsquo;s return is important because during Tribulation Israel will be given an opportunity for a time to worship at a new temple (according to Daniel 9 and Revelation 11). Nevertheless, most of Israel today has little interest in returning to observing a sacrificial system even if a temple were available, so God uses Elijah to prompt Israel&rsquo;s return to orthodoxy immediate prior to the rise of a third temple.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nSecondly, In Matthew 11 we read:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nMatt. 11:13&nbsp;&ldquo;For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.<br />\nMatt. 11:14&nbsp;&ldquo;And if you are willing to accept it, John himself is Elijah who was to come.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice Jesus describes &ldquo;the prophets and the Law&rdquo; in v.13. That phrase is Jesus&rsquo; way of referencing the Old Testament scriptures. So, we could rephrase Jesus&rsquo; words in v.13 to say, &ldquo;The word of God foretold the arrival of the Christ until John&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><br />\nThen in v.14, Jesus refers to accepting &ldquo;it.&rdquo; What is it? By the rules of grammar, the pronoun &ldquo;it&rdquo; must refer to the testimony of &ldquo;the prophets and the Law.&rdquo; In other words, Jesus is again referring to the word of God. So, we can rephrase v.14 to say, &ldquo;if you are willing to accept the testimony of the word of God concerning the Christ, then John is an Elijah for you.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><br />\nJesus is saying that If a person accepts the testimony of the word of God and the testimony of John the Baptist concerning Jesus as the Christ, then that person has found through John&rsquo;s ministry the very same thing Elijah comes to give in Israel. Such a person has returned &ldquo;to the fathers,&rdquo; in the sense of believing in the word of God concerning the ministry of the Messiah. Elijah comes to trigger Israel to return to God&rsquo;s word and to an expectation of a coming Messiah in preparation for the difficult days that lie ahead in the Tribulation. If someone came to this same perspective through John the Baptist&rsquo;s ministry, &nbsp;then for that person, John the Baptist has served as an equivalent to Elijah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\nOn the other hand, Jesus is not saying that John the Baptist WAS the fulfillment of Malachi 4 since even John himself denied this conclusion:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nJohn 1:19&nbsp; This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nJohn 1:20&nbsp;And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, &ldquo;I am not the Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nJohn 1:21&nbsp;They asked him, &ldquo;What then? Are you Elijah?&rdquo; And he&nbsp; said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you the Prophet?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nJohn 1:22&nbsp;Then they said to him, &ldquo;Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nJohn 1:23&nbsp;He said, &ldquo;I am A VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, &lsquo;MAKE STRAIGHT THE WAY OF THE LORD,&rsquo; as Isaiah the prophet said.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nJohn the Baptist confessed that he was NOT the fulfillment of Malachi 4. Rather, he was the fulfillment of a different prophecy found in Isaiah 40. Elijah the prophet is still yet to return as promised. In that way, we can see that John the Baptist was the forerunner to the first coming of Christ while Elijah is the forerunner to the Second Coming of Christ. Only in that sense can we say that John the Baptist is connected to Elijah.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. Can a believer divorce and enter into a new marriage?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A. Let&#39;s begin by establishing a few basic truths from scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus states in all three synoptic Gospels (e.g., Matt 19, Mark 10 &amp; Luke 16) that once a man and woman marry, they have become \"one flesh\" and that \"no man\" can separate this bond. Should the couple divorce and then either remarry or have sexual relations with another, they commit adultery because they violate that one-flesh relationship.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, anyone who marries a divorcee is likewise committing adultery by violating the existing one-flesh relationship. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In Matthew Jesus says:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 19:3 &nbsp;Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking, &ldquo;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 19:4 And He answered and said, &ldquo;Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 19:5 and said, &lsquo;For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh&rsquo;?</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 19:6 &ldquo;So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.&rdquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 19:7 They&nbsp; said to Him, &ldquo;Why then did Moses command to give her a certificate of divorce and send her away?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 19:8 He&nbsp; said to them, &ldquo;Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it has not been this way.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 19:9 &ldquo;And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.&rdquo;</span></h5>\n\n<p>Understanding the \"one-flesh\" principle Jesus teaches in this passage is critical to gaining a&nbsp;proper interpretation of the Bible&#39;s teaching on marriage and divorce. The one-flesh principle originates in the Creation account of Man and Woman, where the two were literally made from the same flesh (see Gen 2). Jesus quotes from Genesis 2&nbsp;in Matthew 19:5&nbsp;stating that every marriage results in an equally inseparable union. A married couple has become one flesh in God&#39;s sight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the one-flesh&nbsp;principle has&nbsp;no exceptions in scripture. Once two people become one-flesh, Jesus said unequivocally that&nbsp;\"no man\" can separate them. Jesus statement in Matthew 19 has the same force as His words in John 10 when speaking of our salvation:</p>\n\n<h5>John 10:28 and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.</h5>\n\n<p>Just as there are no exceptions to the \"no one\" of John 10:28, there can be no exceptions to the \"no man\" of Matthew 19:6. Whatever else we hold to be true about marriage and divorce, we may not take a position that contradicts the one-flesh principle of marriage that Jesus gave His Church.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Consequently, divorce is a sin in most circumstances because God&#39;s word demands life-long faithfulness to a marriage. Though some exceptions exist in scripture, the overarching principle of scripture remains that when two people enter into the covenant of marriage, they are establishing a lifelong, unbreakable bond.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Even if a married couple should choose to live apart (or even pursue a legal separation or divorce), they remain one-flesh in God&#39;s eyes, and therefore remarriage by either person would constitute an act of adultery. For more information on the relationship between marriage and the one-flesh bond, please read <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/if-a-divorcee-remarries-does-he-have-two-wives\">this article</a></strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Having established the principle of one-flesh, let&#39;s consider some possible exceptions. First, scripture teaches that a widow or widower may freely remarry without sin (assuming their new spouse is not a divorcee). This exception is consistent with the one-flesh principle, because the new marriage is formed only after the first one-flesh bond has been broken naturally through death</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 7:2 For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:3 So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man</h5>\n\n<p>So widows and widowers are free to remarry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Jesus refers in passing to another exception in Matthew 5:32 &amp; 19:8.&nbsp;Jesus taught that a man or woman may divorce in the case of \"immorality\" (<em>proneia</em> in Greek). The specific meaning of Jesus&#39; brief exception is often debated&nbsp;and in recent times has&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">given rise to a liberal view in the Church that Jesus was allowing divorce and remarriage in the case of an act of infidelity (e.g., adultery), but this interpretation fails the \"one-flesh\" test Jesus gave His Church.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>To understand Jesus&#39; words properly, we must pay close attention to&nbsp;the Greek word translated as&nbsp;\"immorality.\" Jesus&nbsp;used the&nbsp;Greek word <em>porneia</em>, which refers in general to any immoral act, but especially to acts of immorality commit outside of marriage (i.e., fornication). It&#39;s noteworthy that Jesus <em>didn&#39;t</em>&nbsp;use the common Greek word for infidelity <em>after</em> marriage (i.e.,&nbsp;<em>moichao)&nbsp;</em>which means adultery. We believe&nbsp;Jesus&#39; choice of words here is both significant and deterministic in our application.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus was speaking of a specific kind of infidelity that can only occur prior to the forming of a one-flesh relationship.&nbsp;In Jesus&#39; day, a marriage was formed&nbsp;when a couple was betrothed (or as we would say, engaged). During the betrothal period, a couple was&nbsp;legally married even though they had not yet participated in a wedding ceremony nor consummated the marriage sexually. The engagement period could last a year or longer, and if during this time&nbsp;one of the engaged partners was unfaithful (i.e., engaged in fornication), then the engagement would end in a divorce.</p>\n\n<p>We can see this practice reflected in the story of Mary and Joseph. Matthew tells us that after Joseph was betrothed to Mary, he&nbsp;learned she was pregnant. Naturally, Joseph assumed Mary had been unfaithful to him (i.e., that she had engaged in <em>porneia, </em>to use Jesus&#39; word), so he was prepared to \"send her away.\"&nbsp;The Greek word for \"send away\" is <em>apuluo</em>, which is a euphemism for divorce.</p>\n\n<p>So Joseph was applying Jesus&#39; exception. He was&nbsp;choosing to \"divorce\" Mary for her apparent infidelity during the betrothal period. We know that Joseph and Mary had yet to have sexual relations since the Scriptures testify that Mary was a virgin, so they had not yet established a one-flesh relationship. Therefore, Joseph could divorce Mary without sinning because he was not violating a one-flesh bond. As we know, Joseph didn&#39;t divorce Mary once he learned the true nature of her pregnancy.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we come to understand that Jesus&#39; exception was not speaking of infidelity after marriage but of infidelity after betrothal. This is why He specifically chose to use the Greek word for immorality prior to marriage (<em>porneia</em>) rather than the Greek word for adultery (<em>moicha</em>). Crucially, this&nbsp;interpretation is consistent with the Bible&#39;s one-flesh principle, which says that once a one-flesh relationship is formed, it cannot end except by death.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After a marriage is consummated, however, Jesus&#39; exception no longer applies because a one-flesh relationship now exists.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Consequently, we must conclude that this&nbsp;unique scenario is the&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><em>only</em></strong><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;circumstance in which Jesus permitted divorce.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Obviously, this exception is largely irrelevant for the modern church, since we lack the concept of betrothal. Today, an engagement is not considered a legal marriage, so a couple can break off an engagement without the need to pursue a divorce. Therefore, this exception generally doesn&#39;t apply to the church today.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Regrettably, the church in many places has adopted a more liberal view of this exception by teaching that Jesus was permitting divorce</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;following an act of infidelity during marriage (i.e., adultery), thus freeing both partners to remarry.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Despite the popularity of this view in the church today, t</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">his interpretation finds no support in scripture. The</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;Bible never states explicitly</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;that adultery (</span><em style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">moicheuo</em><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">)&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">is cause for divorce.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">As we explained above, Jesus uses the Greek word&nbsp;<em>porneia</em>&nbsp;in both passages, yet the specific Greek word for adultery is&nbsp;<em>moicheuo</em>.&nbsp;In the New Testament, this Greek word appears 14 times and is always translated in English as &ldquo;adultery\" (in the NASB), while the Greek word&nbsp;<em>porneia</em>&nbsp;appear 26 times in the New Testament, and it is typically translated fornication or immorality.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Notably, the word&nbsp;<em>porneia</em>&nbsp;is never translated as adultery in English, which makes sense&nbsp;since&nbsp;<em>porneia</em>&nbsp;is not the Greek the word commonly used to mean adultery.&nbsp;Though&nbsp;<em style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">porneia</em><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;can describe&nbsp;any act of immorality, in practice Greek favors the use of&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">moicheuo</em><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;when speaking specifically about an act of infidelity&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">following</em><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;marriage (i.e., adultery). For acts of&nbsp;immorality committed&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">prior</em><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;to marriage, the Greek language favors&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">porneia</em><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">So it is significant that as Jesus spoke on the topic of marriage in Matthew 5 and 19, He used&nbsp;<em>porneia</em>&nbsp;not&nbsp;<em>moicheuo </em>in both passages.&nbsp;Had Jesus been thinking of infidelity after marriage, why didn&rsquo;t He use the Greek word for adultery? By choosing to use the Greek word describing immorality prior to marriage, Jesus was clearly speaking of unfaithfulness during a betrothal period &ndash; something&nbsp;possible in Jesus day but very uncommon in the way marriage is practiced today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Therefore,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">a fair interpretation of</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Jesus&rsquo; words in</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Matthew 5 and 19 must conclude that Jesus was</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><em>not</em></strong><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">speaking of adultery,&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;His words were</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</span><strong style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><em>not</em></strong><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">permission to&nbsp;divorce&nbsp;and remarry following&nbsp;adultery. He was speaking of&nbsp;immorality during a betrothal period only. Furthermore, since&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">adultery always takes place after a one-flesh&nbsp;relationship has been established in marriage, adultery cannot be reason to divorce and remarriage, since it violates the one-flesh principle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Remember,&nbsp;any interpretation of Jesus words on marriage&nbsp;must account both for Jesus&#39;&nbsp;choice of Greek words and His unequivocal statement that two becoming&nbsp;one-flesh&nbsp;may never be separated except by death. Our&nbsp;</span>interpretation is consistent with both the meaning of the Greek words and scripture&#39;s unchanging, inviolate one-flesh&nbsp;principle. Simply put, there&nbsp;can be no exceptions to this principle, or else the principle stated in Genesis 2 becomes meaningless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">While the more liberal, modern interpretation of Jesus&#39; words to mean divorce in cases of adultery is popular in the church today, it cannot meet this test. Moreover, it introduces new problems.</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">For example, if adultery by one partner dissolves the one-flesh marriage bond, then it must (by logical necessity) permit both partners to remarry. Such an interpretation would then lead to rewarding an unfaithful spouse for his or her sinful behavior. He or she would gain the opportunity to remarry by their act of adultery, which is <em>greater</em> mercy than Jesus<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;grants to</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;a&nbsp;faithful spouse who has been abandoned or abused, since that person would still be required to honor the bad marriage. </span></p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Clearly, such an interpretation is unjust and therefore incorrect., and it&nbsp;</span>exposes the&nbsp;fatal flaw in the modern, liberal interpretation. Allowing remarriage in cases of adultery not only violates the one-flesh principle of Scripture, it rewards&nbsp;infidelity. Those who wish to escape a bad marriage and seek a new marriage need only commit adultery to secure a divorce. How can we conclude&nbsp;that Jesus intended that one sin (i.e., adultery) would become a legitimate cause to engage in another sin&nbsp;(i.e., divorce and remarriage)?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Such an unjust and illogical conclusion argues strongly against such an interpretation</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">, as Isaiah said:</span></p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Is. 5:20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Finally, the liberal interpretation of divorce in cases of adultery runs counter to the spiritual symbology&nbsp;of marriage given in Scripture. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Bible teaches that our covenant relationship in marriage is a picture of our covenant relationship with Christ In Ephesians 5 and Romans 7, the Church&#39;s covenant relationship with Christ is equated to the relationship between a bride and her groom, and therefore what is true for&nbsp;one relationship must follow for the other.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So if we believe Jesus taught that unfaithfulness during marriage invalidates a marriage covenant, then we must also conclude that spiritual unfaithfulness to Christ dissolves our covenant with Him.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, Scripture says this is <em>not</em> true. Our union with Christ endures even if we are unfaithful to Him, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 2:11 &nbsp;It is a trustworthy statement:<br />\nor if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;</h5>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 2:12 &nbsp;If we endure, we will also reign with Him;<br />\nIf we deny Him, He also will deny us;</h5>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 2:13 &nbsp;If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Therefore, we must conclude that&nbsp;earthly marriage is intended to operation in all ways consistent with our relationship with Christ. Both relationships result in&nbsp;bonds which cannot be broken. If we hold that infidelity after marriage is just cause to end the relationship, then&nbsp;we would be testifying that our relationship with Christ is equally tenuous. We are suggesting that Christ&nbsp;will end His relationship with us should we show infidelity toward Him. Praise the Lord that this is not true, for if it were so who could be secure in Christ?<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Other Proposed Exceptions</h4>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Beyond the exception Jesus gave, some see other reasons for divorce and remarriage in Scripture, but do these possible exceptions pass the test of the one-flesh principle?</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">For example, some maintain that&nbsp;Paul taught an exception in 1Corinthians 7&nbsp;when he says the Lord releases a believer from working to preserve a marriage with an unbeliever should the unbelieving spouse abandoned the relationship (1Cor 7:15).</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 7:15 Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Paul says the believer is not obligated to pursue the unbeliever but instead&nbsp;can be \"at peace\" with the separation. While Paul is clearly compassionate toward the abandoned believer, his statement in 1Cor 7:15 is&nbsp;not permission to remarry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">To be \"at peace\" and not \"under bondage\"&nbsp;doesn&#39;t mean (nor even implies) that the abandoned spouse has permission&nbsp;to remarry.&nbsp;Given the overall context of 1Corinthian 7, the proper interpretation of Paul&#39;s words would be that a believer may be at peace with the situation of&nbsp;living a single life and is not under bondage to preserve the marriage relationship. Nevertheless, this has no bearing on the one-flesh relationship, therefore remarriage is not possible. This interpretation is also consistent with Paul&#39;s earlier statement in the same letter to&nbsp;remain as we are (1Cor 7:17).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In summary, Scripture consistently teaches that married couples should remain forever committed to their marriages, and divorce is not acceptable to God. The Bible only permits remarriage in circumstances where a spouse has died or when infidelity occurs before the consummation of the marriage.</p>\n\n<p>If a couple has divorced, then scripture commands they both to remain faithful to their one-flesh bond (<em>i.e</em>., no remarriage or fornication). They either may reconcile (provide neither has remarried), or else they must live a life of singleness. If one partner remarries (or engages in sex outside the marriage), that person commits adultery, but even so&nbsp;the remaining partner must remain faithful to the one-flesh relationship or else they commit adultery as well.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Applying Biblical Truth<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>Having stated the Biblical truth clearly, we must also acknowledge that the application of this truth can be difficult in practice. Many tough questions arise and personal circumstances may leave us wondering how best to apply what God says in His word.</p>\n\n<p>Some Christians have suggested that the condition of a person&#39;s relationship with Christ &nbsp;(i.e., believer vs. unbeliever) has bearing on how we apply these standards. For example,&nbsp;if an unbeliever divorces but then becomes a believer later, is that person now eligible to remarry, since the Christian has become a \"new creature\" in Christ (i.e., 2Cor 5:17).</p>\n\n<p>This is not a valid interpretation, since Paul&#39;s teaching in 2Cor 5 was that believers enjoy a new spiritual life in Christ. He was not teaching that all the earthly obligations we have made in life \"reset\" when we come to Christ. A slave who comes to Christ is still a slave (<em>see the letter of Philemon</em>). A debtor who comes to Christ is still required to repay his debts. Likewise, a&nbsp;divorcee who comes to faith in Christ is still required to honor that one-flesh relationship. Remember, the one-flesh relationship of marriage was established in the Garden of Eden, so it applies to all humanity, both believer and unbeliever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Others teach that if a unbeliever divorces and remarries but later becomes a believer, the believer&#39;s new-found faith in Christ obligates them to&nbsp;leave the second marriage and seek reconciliation with the first spouse. The Bible <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/does_a_divorced_and_remarried_christian_commit_continuous_sin\">specifically prohibits such a reconciliation</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Still, other Christians question what constitutes a Biblical marriage? For example, is the person who engages in premarital sex with multiple partners prior to marriage (or even chooses to move in with a partner for a period of time) still eligible to marry, or did those earlier sexual encounters constitute earlier marriages (i.e., one-flesh relationships) in God&#39;s eyes? <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/is_premarital_sex_equal_to_a_marriage\">Our reading of scripture</a> tells us these relationships do not constitute marriage since they were not accompanied by marriage vows. Such sexual encounters are simply acts of fornication, not marriage.</p>\n\n<p>What about the wife who is physically abused by her husband? Must she stay in that abusive relationship? God&#39;s word doesn&#39;t require a wife to submit to physical abuse, so under such circumstances physical separation is appropriate. In extreme cases, legal separation may be warranted, but in all cases divorce and remarriage are prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>Is a&nbsp;common-law marriage&nbsp;a valid marriage in God&#39;s eyes? If the relationship begins with&nbsp;a public commitment of faithfulness and a consummation of the relationship, the answer is&nbsp;yes. If no vows have been exchanged, then the relationship is merely fornication, which is sin prior to marriage.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Unanswerable Questions<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>But not all our questions will have easy answers. What do we tell the wife whose husband is declared missing in action during war and presumed dead? How long must she wait before she remarries? What if she concludes her husband must have died and so she remarries but then her missing husband unexpectedly returns home? Has she committed adultery?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We could imagine an infinite number of unlikely, hypothetical situations, and therefore it&#39;s impossible to address every situation perfectly. Nonetheless, we believe God has provided enough direction and clarity in His word to guide the Church into righteousness concerning conduct in marriage. Moreover, the Spirit will guide us individually in how we respond to our own circumstances. Nevertheless, we must not let our lustful and selfish desires cause us to set aside the truth of Scripture so we may do what is right in our own eyes.</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, the safest counsel to any couple contemplating divorce or remarriage is that in all cases divorce and remarriage is sin. When a divorce or separation takes place, the separated&nbsp;partners must continue to honor their one-flesh bond. Therefore, they should continue seeking reconciliation, even if reconciliation seems impossible, impractical or undesired.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we should also emphasize that divorce and remarriage are not \"unforgivable\" sins. If a Christian divorces and remarries, the believer commits adultery, but by God&#39;s grace he or she is&nbsp;forgiven and that sin is washed clean by the blood of Christ. While&nbsp;this truth may not become license to sin, it does remind us that we (the Church) may not stand in judgment over our brothers and sisters who divorce or remarry, especially since the sin of divorce and remarriage&nbsp;is no greater than our own sins (e.g., Matt 5:28). Therefore, we should show our fellow brothers and sisters grace and mercy and love, recognizing that the Lord paid the price for all sin.</p>\n\n<p>As with all things, we encourage you to pray and wait for the Holy Spirit to answer your specific concerns. We are confident that if you seek Him earnestly, He will be faithful to lay on your heart the correct course of action. Have the confidence and faith to obey the Holy Spirit in the knowledge that He desires to lead you in righteousness.&nbsp;</p>"

For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 13:2 Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 13:3 &nbsp;For rulers are not a cause of fear for&nbsp; good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 13:4 &nbsp;for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an&nbsp; avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. </span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 13:5 &nbsp;Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also&nbsp; for conscience&rsquo; sake.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 13:6 &nbsp;For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 13:7&nbsp; Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">While we are commanded to respect the government as an extension of God&rsquo;s authority in our lives, at times the government may ask us to violate our responsibilities to obey the Lord and His word. When a Christian faces such a circumstance, we continue to submit to the government once again, but only in&nbsp;the sense that we submit to the government&#39;s authority to&nbsp;punishment us for resisting it&#39;s laws. Any resulting persecution is God-ordained and should be accepted joyfully:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:10 &nbsp;&ldquo;Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:11 &nbsp;&ldquo;Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Matt. 5:12 &nbsp;&ldquo;Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for&nbsp; in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For example, if the law required us to participate in sinful behavior, we not free to sin and therefore we are not free to obey that law and must disobey it. Nevertheless, the government still has authority over us, so we should expect it to bring charges and penalties under the law, which we must submit to willingly.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nRemember, the Lord is sovereignly orchestrating all these events. He has permitted the government to pass unrighteous laws. He has permitted the government to come against His children and persecute them when they disobey. He has commanded us to remain faithful to Him, and, therefore, He is using all these circumstances to glorify Himself by our suffering. He is using all these things for good purposes.<br />\n<br />\nFor a longer, in-depth teaching on this principle, we recommend you listen to our <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans Bible study, Lesson 12B</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>"

These rituals are generally considered to be&nbsp;products of the &ldquo;Great Awakening&rdquo; movements of the 18th-19th century in Britain and the United States. They were&nbsp;created as part of the camp meeting&nbsp;and revival tent ministries of that time. These practices were the inventions of men like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Grandison_Finney\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Finney</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Campbell_(clergyman)\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Campbell</a> among others, who propagated new and unorthodox ideas concerning the meaning of Christ&rsquo;s atonement and how men may be saved.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFor example, Finny rejected the biblical doctrines of salvation by grace alone and original sin. He was a proponent of the false doctrine of perfectionism, which holds that Christians are not only saved from the penalty of sin but also from the experiencing of sin. He taught that men have free moral agency in all matters including the Gospel, and therefore salvation was the result of a free will choice to follow God and not the result of divine regeneration.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nGiven his erroneous theology, Finney believed he could obtain more converts by means of subtle intimidation and emotional manipulation.&nbsp;Since by his estimation the&nbsp;only thing standing in the way of salvation was human will, he saw nothing wrong in relying on such &ldquo;persuasion&rdquo; to recruit conversions, while never expressing any&nbsp;concern over whether the confessions he coerced were genuine.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nHe is particularly well-known for his &ldquo;revival meetings,&rdquo; where he whipped crowds into an emotional frenzy by his preaching and through various rituals designed to pressure doubters into agreeing with the Gospel.&nbsp;The altar call and sinner&rsquo;s prayer were two such rituals Finney relied upon to gain a response. Another was the &ldquo;anxious seat,&rdquo; a place where those who were wavering could sit and receive prayer. In reality, these techniques were all&nbsp;opportunities for intimidation and peer pressure, which served to turned undecideds into false confessors (and perhaps some true believers as well).&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThough Finney may have had the best of intentions, he preached a false Gospel (casting into doubt his own faith), and at the very least, he practiced an unbiblical form of evangelism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches that belief in the Gospel is never the fruit of coercion nor a bending of the human will. As Paul says, it is a work of the Holy Spirit in the heart:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\n1Cor. 12:3&nbsp;Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, &ldquo;Jesus is&nbsp;accursed&rdquo;; and no one can say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; except by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5><br />\nRom. 8:14&nbsp;For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:15&nbsp;For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 8:16&nbsp;The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nOnly the Lord can change a heart by His Spirit, and although the Lord purposes to deliver His Gospel through the&nbsp;agency of men, the power to receive it and believe in it remains with God alone. The self-evident truth of the message is manifested by the work of the Spirit.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAs Paul says of his own preaching:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\n1Cor. 1:22&nbsp;For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom;&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:23&nbsp;but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 1:24&nbsp;but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nIn fact, Paul made it clear that he would not stoop to tricks and rhetorical flourish as a substitute for the power of God in the message of salvation:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\n1Cor. 2:1&nbsp; And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 2:2&nbsp;For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nIf the greatest evangelist in the history of the church was content to rely solely on the power of God by His word for his results, why should we do any less?</p>\n\n<p>The altar call and sinner&rsquo;s prayer are the modern-day descendants&nbsp;of Finney&#39;s anxious seat. Even in&nbsp;the best of cases, they are misused relics of poor theology, and in the worst cases, they are instruments of public pressure and intimidation.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nChurches that rely heavily on these techniques may grow their flock numerically, but they should&nbsp;question the sincerity of these &ldquo;confessions&rdquo; and give thought to the long-term consequences of potentially welcoming deceived unbelievers&nbsp;into the congregation of God. This&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;mean these techniques are automatically nor universally wrong, but we should consider the implications of relying upon&nbsp;contrived and easily abused techniques rather than upon the Spirit.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIn their place, we recommend churches teach the word of God &ndash; including preaching the Gospel clearly, boldly and routinely &ndash; yet without relying on mechanical and ritualistic demands&nbsp;for listeners&nbsp;to respond in certain ways&nbsp;or to say certain prayers. If hearts are moved by the Gospel, they will respond without regard to a specific prescription other than the Bible&#39;s demands: confess with the mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in the heart that God raised Him from the dead.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong>Q: Why in the context of the &ldquo;law of liberty&rdquo; did James quote from the Ten Commandments (James 2:8-12)&nbsp;if they are not binding today? He is not by any means referring to it as the &ldquo;ministry of death&rdquo; like Paul did, so why is the text in James often used to prove that both the Ten Commandments are binding and are a law of liberty.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA: Let&rsquo;s look at four points.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, the Bible teaches plainly that a Christian is not under the Law of Moses. The Law was given to Israel as part of a covenant extended only to Israel. While all men are transgressors of the perfect and holy Law of God, only one group of people on earth were ever commanded by God to live according to that Law. (See our Exodus study for a complete teaching on this principle).<br />\n<br />\nSecondly, the Bible teaches that no man can meet the test of the Law, whether Jew or Gentile. Every man has broken the Law, and as James says, if we break even one Law, we are guilty of the whole Law. In fact, the Bible says in Romans that the purpose of the Law was simply to reveal our sin; it was not intended to remedy sin or give us a recipe for reducing sin.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nSo even when a Christian (mistakenly) believes he should keep the Law or even just the Ten Commandments, he is still utterly failing at keeping the Law, and his failure only serves to reinforce the principle that the only purpose of the Law is to reveal our sin.<br />\n<br />\nThirdly, James quotes from the Ten Commandments&nbsp;to mock those who try to follow the Law. He isn&rsquo;t reinforcing the value of follow the Law; he&rsquo;s illustrating the senselessness of following the Law piecemeal, trying to keep one law while simultaneously violating another.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nNotice James&rsquo; tone of sarcasm and rebuke:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nJames 2:9&nbsp;But if you&nbsp;&nbsp;show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the&nbsp;&nbsp;law as transgressors.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:10&nbsp;For whoever keeps the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;law and yet&nbsp;&nbsp;stumbles in one point, he has become&nbsp;&nbsp;guilty of all.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:11&nbsp;For He who said, &ldquo;&nbsp;DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY,&rdquo; also said, &ldquo;&nbsp;DO NOT COMMIT MURDER.&rdquo; Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the&nbsp;&nbsp;law.&nbsp;<br />\nJames 2:12&nbsp;So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by&nbsp;&nbsp;the law of liberty.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice James demonstrates the futility of keeping the Law partially. He calls obeying one of the commandments while violating another commandment &ldquo;partiality.&rdquo; In other words, keeping some of the Law is useless and foolishness, for it accomplishes nothing. When Christians endeavor to keep the Law, they are merely serving their own egos and fleshly pride, taking satisfaction in trying sanctify themselves by their own works, which is not possible. The Bible says that we are sanctified by the work of the Spirit in our heart as we walk in faith, not by following laws written on stone.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIn v.12 James says that rather than trying to follow the Law of Moses, we should instead act as those to be judged according to the Law of Liberty. He isn&rsquo;t saying that following the Ten Commandments is the same as following the Law of Liberty. That conclusion is a poor interpretation of scripture. The word &ldquo;so&rdquo; at the beginning of v.12 means &ldquo;instead&rdquo; in the original Greek, so the two laws are being set in opposition in the original Greek language.<br />\n<br />\nTherefore, James is teaching that instead of following the Law of Moses, the Christian follows the Law of Liberty. The Law of Moses and the Law of Liberty are entirely different things. One is written on stone and given to Israel; the other is written on the hearts of those in the New Covenant. One is a ministry of death; the other a ministry of life (according to Paul). One has power only to condemn; the other brings power to please God. (Once again, we offer an extended discussion on the differences in our Exodus study.)<br />\n<br />\nSome churches that practice legalism will&nbsp;teach that certain works of the Jewish Law (like keeping a Sabbath) are requirements for Christians, but this is not the Bible&rsquo;s teaching. Legalism places unnecessary burdens on believers. Consider the harsh rebuke Paul offered to those who would teach that Christians must follow the Law:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nGal. 2:18&nbsp;&ldquo;For if I rebuild what I have once destroyed, I&nbsp;&nbsp;prove myself to be a transgressor.&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 2:19&nbsp;&ldquo;For through&nbsp;&nbsp;the Law I&nbsp;&nbsp;died to&nbsp;&nbsp;the Law, so that I might live to God.&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 2:20&nbsp;&ldquo;I have been&nbsp;&nbsp;crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ lives in me; and&nbsp;&nbsp;the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in&nbsp;&nbsp;the Son of God, who&nbsp;&nbsp;loved me and&nbsp;&nbsp;gave Himself up for me.&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 2:21&nbsp;&ldquo;I do not nullify the grace of God, for&nbsp;&nbsp;if righteousness comes through&nbsp;&nbsp;the Law, then Christ died needlessly.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 3:1&nbsp;&nbsp;You foolish&nbsp;&nbsp;Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ&nbsp;&nbsp;was publicly portrayed as crucified?&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 3:2&nbsp;This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of&nbsp;&nbsp;the Law, or by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hearing with faith?&nbsp;<br />\nGal. 3:3&nbsp;Are you so foolish? Having begun&nbsp;&nbsp;by the Spirit, are you now&nbsp;&nbsp;being perfected by the flesh?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nPaul says if we attempt to rebuild what was destroyed by Christ&rsquo;s death (referring to re-establishing the Law of Moses), we only prove ourselves to be transgressors of that Law. It&rsquo;s only purpose was to expose sin, NOT to make someone more holy or righteous. We die to the Law when we accept Christ, Paul says (see Romans 7). He calls such people foolish.<br />\n<br />\nPaul was speaking 2,000 years ago, but he might as well have been writing these words to those in your church or any church who teach this same error. We strongly recommend you listen to our Galatians and Romans studies for in-depth, accurate exposition of the Bible&rsquo;s teaching on the relationship between faith and the Law.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For more in-depth teaching on the relationship between the Christian and the Law, please consult the following&nbsp;<a href=\"/search/eyJyZXN1bHRfcGFnZSI6InNlYXJjaCIsImtleXdvcmRzIjoibGF3In0\">list of&nbsp;articles and studies</a> found on the VBVMI website.</span></p>"

If not, how is it that there are fallen angels still to this day if the flood wiped all of them out?</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A: The Bible teaches that life only exists on the Earth, for the rest of the universe was created solely for humanity to witness. All life that exists is present on the Earth, so &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; do not exist.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTherefore, the various supposed sightings of aliens must be either lies, hoaxes, atmospheric phenomenon or the deceptions of demons. Demons are fallen angels, and the Bible says they sometimes present themselves to men as &ldquo;light&rdquo; (2Cor 11:14). Therefore, it&rsquo;s possible that some of these appearances are demons working to convince humanity that life exists elsewhere in the Universe.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nRegarding the flood, no demons (or angels) were destroyed in the flood. Only those who dwell on the earth were destroyed. The victims included the Nephilim, the offspring of the demons and women (see our teaching from Genesis 6 in our Genesis Bible study). After this, the Lord also placed the demons responsible for this&nbsp;perversion into the abyss:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nJude 6 \"And&nbsp;angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has&nbsp;kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day,\"</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nSo although some of the demons are in a prison, the rest are still roaming free under the control of Satan.&nbsp;</p>"

Did those saints return to the tombs?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A: Regarding Matthew 27, we read:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nMatt. 27:50&nbsp;And Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 27:51&nbsp;&nbsp;And behold,&nbsp;the&nbsp;veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth shook and the rocks were split.&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 27:52&nbsp;The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the&nbsp;saints who had&nbsp;&nbsp;fallen asleep were raised;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 27:53&nbsp;and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered&nbsp;&nbsp;the holy city and appeared to many.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThe saints who have&nbsp;&ldquo;fallen asleep&rdquo; refers to Old Testament believers who had died. At the death of Christ, their bodies were brought back to life and walked out of tombs. They then went into Jerusalem and appeared to the man who knew them to have died previously. Clearly, this was a shocking miracle intended to testify to the reality of Jesus&rsquo; claims.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These saints are never named in scripture because their identity doesn&rsquo;t matter. What mattered was that people in that day knew them, so there could be witnesses to testify to the truth of the miracle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Later, these revived saints died a second time, as did Lazarus who was raised by Christ. The resurrection to new, eternal life will not happen for the Old Testament saints until the start of the Kingdom, according to Daniel:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nDan. 12:1&nbsp; &ldquo;Now at that time&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael, the great prince who stands guard over the sons of your people, will arise. And there will be a&nbsp;&nbsp;time of distress&nbsp;&nbsp;such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the&nbsp;&nbsp;book, will be rescued.&nbsp;<br />\nDan. 12:2&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake,&nbsp;&nbsp;these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting&nbsp;&nbsp;contempt.&nbsp;<br />\nDan. 12:3&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;Those who have&nbsp;&nbsp;insight will&nbsp;&nbsp;shine brightly like the brightness of the&nbsp;&nbsp;expanse of heaven, and those who&nbsp;&nbsp;lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Based on the context of Daniel 11-12, the time mentioned at the beginning of Daniel 12:1 is the end of Tribulation and the second coming of Christ. This will be the moment when all Old Testament and Tribulation saints will be resurrected.

First, we know that Herod the Great was ruling when Jesus was born:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 2:1 \" Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying...\"</h5>\n\n<p>Since history records that Herod the Great died in 4 BC, Jesus must have been born no later than 4 BC.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Secondly, we know that Jesus began His earthly ministry at &ldquo;about&rdquo; the age of 30:</span></p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 3:23 &nbsp;\"When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about&nbsp;thirty&nbsp;years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Eli\"</span></h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, we know Jesus&rsquo; earthly ministry to Israel lasted three years, as Jesus refers to Himself as the landowner in the parable of the unfruitful tree in the vineyard:</span></p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 13:7&nbsp;&ldquo;And he said to the vineyard-keeper, &lsquo;Behold, for&nbsp;three years&nbsp;I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any.

The text only says that \"man&#39;s days shall be one hundred and twenty years.\" That phrase is open to interpretation, and although it is common to find teachers claiming&nbsp;this passage limits&nbsp;man&#39;s lifespan, we should note that there is room for another&nbsp;interpretation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In interpreting the Bible, we must allow the context to drive our conclusions, and when we consult the context of&nbsp;Genesis 6, we arrive at&nbsp;a very different (and much simpler) interpretation of this verse. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">First, notice the context of Genesis 6&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong><em>not</em></strong> focused on the question of&nbsp;man&#39;s longevity. In fact, the&nbsp;topic of human lifespan&nbsp;is nowhere to be found in the story of the flood. So why would such a&nbsp;topic suddenly become part of the narrative in v.3 but then disappear altogether afterward? This doesn&#39;t make sense, so there is no&nbsp;reason to inject that topic into our interpretation. Inserting the issue of lifespan into the narrative of Genesis 6 is an example of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisegesis\">eisegesis</a>, which is an invalid, subjective&nbsp;method of interpretation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">When we consider the true context of Genesis 6,&nbsp;what do we find?&nbsp;We see that at the start of the chapter the&nbsp;Lord explains the need for the Flood, arising out of&nbsp;world events. Demonic interactions with women&nbsp;were polluting the&nbsp;human seed, which threatened&nbsp;the seed promise of the Messiah. So in v.3&nbsp;we find&nbsp;the Lord declaring that these dire circumstances have forced His hand to cleanse the world of this sin. [For an in-depth discussion of the seed promise, please listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis Bible study</a>.]</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Then in v.3&nbsp;the Lord&nbsp;declares that His Spirit will not strive with men forever, which means He will not exhibit patience forever but eventually He will act to correct this problem. At the end of v.3, the Lord declares&nbsp;man&#39;s days are numbered, and He will bring an end&nbsp;in&nbsp;120 years. This is not a discussion of lifespan but of timing for judgment.&nbsp;Even today,&nbsp;we use a similar phrase to indicate someone will eventually&nbsp;receive judgment&nbsp;(i.e., we say \"his days are numbered.\"). Later, we learn that God brings His judgment by way of&nbsp;a worldwide flood. Consequently, the&nbsp;120 years measures&nbsp;the time of God&#39;s patience before He brought the flood, not the limit on man&#39;s lifespan.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;So based on the context, we interpret</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;120 years to be the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">number of years until the Lord brought the flood upon the earth.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">God said He would only&nbsp;tolerate such extreme sin on the earth for another 120 years, at which point He would wipe out the earth with a flood. This is how we know that the flood came exactly 120 years later.</span></p>\n\n<p>There is a second reason we must reject the conventional interpretation that man&#39;s lifespan was limited to 120 years. Such an interpretation contradicts other scripture. Reading through the rest of Genesis,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">we find many&nbsp;people who lived much longer than 120 years even <strong><em>after</em></strong> the Lord God made His declaration in chapter 6. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For example, Noah lived to 600 years even&nbsp;<strong><em>after</em></strong>&nbsp;God&#39;s declaration, and his sons&nbsp;also&nbsp;lived hundreds of years <strong><em>after</em></strong> this declaration. Generations&nbsp;later&nbsp;we still find Abraham, Isaac and Jacob living well past the age of 120 years. Even&nbsp;today people are reported to live&nbsp;longer than&nbsp;120 years old on rare occasions. These facts&nbsp;lead us to&nbsp;wonder what value was God&#39;s pronouncement if it placed a limit of 120 years on man&#39;s life? What did this so-called limit achieve&nbsp;given how often it has proven ineffective? Is this how God&#39;s word works?</span></p>\n\n<p>Clearly,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">God&#39;s word is&nbsp;the final authority in the Universe and nothing in Creation can frustrated the plans of God. In fact, t</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">he Bible states plainly that God&#39;s word will always come to pass once it has been declared by Him:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Is. 55:11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It will not return to Me empty,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Without accomplishing what I desire,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.</span></h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, i</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">nterpreting Genesis 6:3 to mean mankind will not live past 120 years</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;contradicts other scripture and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">erodes&nbsp;confidence in the power of God&#39;s word. <u>A</u></span><u><u style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">ny</u></u><u style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> interpretation of scripture that diminishes confidence in God&#39;s word cannot be correct</u><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;We must choose the interpretation that&nbsp;fits the context <em>and</em>&nbsp;harmonizes with the rest of scripture, which is that God set a time limit of 120 years before He would bring&nbsp;the flood on earth&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">By the way, this&nbsp;example illustrates how the improper interpretation of scripture can gain widespread acceptance through repetition from the pulpit&nbsp;even though that interpretation plainly contradictions other scripture. Such poor biblical scholarship is dangerous, because it&nbsp;erodes believers&#39; confidence in the authority of scripture, especially when these manmade contradictions are brought to their attention (i.e., as when a person see a news report of someone living past 120 years and begins to question the trustworthiness of the Bible).&nbsp;</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Sometimes I wonder if I am&nbsp;actually saved? Is there a criteria or test to be sure?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nFirst, the test of salvation is clear in scripture:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nRom. 10:9&nbsp;that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nIf you have done these things, then you are saved for eternity. Following salvation, we continue to live in a sinful, fleshly body for a time, and in that state we experience disappointments&nbsp;that all Christians &ndash; even the Apostle Paul &ndash; share. Consider what Paul said about himself in Romans 7:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nRom. 7:14&nbsp; For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:15&nbsp;For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:16&nbsp;But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with the Law, confessing that the Law is good.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:17&nbsp;So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:18&nbsp;For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:19&nbsp;For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:20&nbsp;But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:21&nbsp;I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:22&nbsp;For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:23&nbsp;but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:24&nbsp;Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death?&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 7:25&nbsp;Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.&nbsp;<br />\nIt&rsquo;s it remarkable that Paul describes himself as someone who is &ldquo;practicing what I would like to do&rdquo;? Clearly, if the Apostle Paul was prone to live in sin from time to time, then we can all expect to be disappointed in our behavior as well.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nBelievers are not perfect; we are simply forgiven of our sin. Your faith in Jesus Christ and your love for His word are proof of your salvation, and the fact that you continue to sin from time to time is merely proof that you continue to occupy a sinful, fleshly body. One&nbsp;day the Lord will rescue us from our this tombs of flesh, and in that day we will be like Christ.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, the Sprit living in us works to convict us of sin so that we will move beyond it, confirming ourselves to a life of godliness. Do not doubt your salvation simply because you feel guilt for your sin. On the contrary, your conviction is proof of the Holy Spirit working in you to sanctify you. As Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\n2 Cor. 7:10&nbsp;For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">When we go to heaven will we remember our life on Earth?</span></strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Bible gives us strong assurance that we will retain memories of our life on earth, at least to a degree, as well as our personalities and the degree of spiritual maturity we obtain while on earth.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">First, we know that we will retain our identities, at least in the sense of our unique personalities. For example, the Lord promised that the 12 Apostles would rule over the 12 tribes of Israel in the Kingdom:</span></p>\n\n<h5><br />\nMatt. 19:27&nbsp; Then Peter said to Him, &ldquo;Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 19:28&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\"</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nObviously, if these men receive what has been promised to them, they maintain their identities, and if they maintain identities, then they must retain memories, for our identity is the result of a lifetime of experiences.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nLikewise, the Bible promises that King David will be resurrected and reign over Israel in the Kingdom (though still under Christ&#39;s authority as King of the world).&nbsp;Speaking of the Millennial Kingdom, Ezekiel says:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nEzek. 37:24&nbsp; &ldquo;My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd; and they will walk in My ordinances and keep My statutes and observe them.&nbsp;<br />\nEzek. 37:25&nbsp;&ldquo;They will live on the land that I gave to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their sons and their sons&rsquo; sons, forever; and David My servant will be their prince forever.\"&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nDavid must maintain his identity (and memories) after the resurrection in order for God to&nbsp;fulfill this prophecy. When&nbsp;we enter the Kingdom, we will all know David as David, which means both David and everyone else must retain memories of life on earth. We&nbsp;must know each other as who we were on earth originally, otherwise this promise to David would be meaningless. So, we can safely conclude we must maintain some degree of memory in the Kingdom.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWe also retain our degree of spiritual maturity gained on earth. The Lord promises that those who are faithful with little in this lifetime will be counted worthy for greater responsibility in the age to come:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nLuke 16:9&nbsp;&ldquo;And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the wealth of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings.<br />\nLuke 16:10&nbsp; &ldquo;He who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous also in much.<br />\nLuke 16:11&nbsp;&ldquo;Therefore if you have not been faithful in the use of unrighteous wealth, who will entrust the true riches to you?\"</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice that Jesus says we are to use our time (and money) now to further the purposes of the Kingdom, so that when we enter the Kingdom we will be welcomed by friends who remember our generosity. Clearly, we must maintain some degree of memory after our resurrection if Jesus&rsquo; words are to be understood literally.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nOn the other hand, the scriptures indicate that some aspects of our life of earth will no longer trouble us. For example, the Bible says:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nRev. 21:3&nbsp;And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,&nbsp;<br />\nRev. 21:4&nbsp;and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nApparently, those experiences from out life on earth that brought us sadness and pain will no longer trouble us in the same way. Perhaps we will remember past disappointments yet without sorrow. Nevertheless, we can say that memories persist into Heaven, though sadness and mourning do not.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Should pastors or B</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">ible teachers go to seminary?&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\nAs Pastor Armstrong frequently says, \"God chooses to work through people who are unqualified&hellip;but He never leaves them untrained.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe first question for anyone seeking to serve God is whether the Lord called that person to serve? Has the Lord called a person to teach or to pastor? If not, then any pursuit of service in this role&nbsp;will be folly and a work of the flesh rather than of the Spirit. Even if such a person graduates seminary and enters pastoral ministry, he would lack the Lord&rsquo;s anointing for pastoral ministry, and, therefore, his &ldquo;ministry&rdquo; would be self-serving and potentially harmful.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWhile seminary education can be an important and helpful starting point for a man entering pastoral ministry, no earthly institution is a replacement for the Spirit&rsquo;s teaching and a student&rsquo;s personal diligence and dedication to the task.&nbsp;Unfortunately, many ministers approach service to the Lord as a career rather than a calling, and so in these cases, their seminary degrees are little more than&nbsp;man-made accolades substituting for a genuine call and anointing from God.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nMore importantly, the&nbsp;Bible never prescribes a seminary education&nbsp;as a pre-requisite&nbsp;for ministry. Instead, the Bible requires that elders affirm men with a calling and anointing to serve, and then publicly commission the man&nbsp;through a laying on of hands.&nbsp;Following the laying on of hands, the&nbsp;individual undertakes a lifetime of personal study and discipleship to be prepared to meet demands of their call.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In all cases, a pastor&#39;s ministerial training must be according to the Spirit&rsquo;s supply, whether through a seminar experience or by personally-directed study or under discipleship of a Sunday school teacher or an internet ministry (like VBVMI), or else it will be of little value. In other words, the form of training matters little; the content and source of that training is the key.<br />\n<br />\nSecondly, every man desiring to pastor and teach the word of God must be prepared to undertake a lifetime of diligent study. Over that time, the person&rsquo;s opportunity to minister may be increased according to the Lord&rsquo;s providence as the person matures in his understanding of God&rsquo;s word and his personal character.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFor example, consider Paul&rsquo;s advice to a young pastor, Timothy:</p>\n\n<h5><br />\n1Tim. 4:14&nbsp;Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was bestowed on you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the presbytery.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 4:15&nbsp;Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that your progress will be evident to all.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 4:16&nbsp;Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nPaul remarks that Timothy&rsquo;s authority to ministry was conveyed through a laying on of hands by the elders (presbytery). Timothy didn&rsquo;t become a pastor because an institution granted Timothy a diploma. He was elevated into service by other leaders&nbsp;as a result of a self-evident&nbsp;call and an anointing. God called and approved this man for ministry, and then the church leadership acted to recognize, acknowledge&nbsp;and confirm&nbsp;that calling in a public way.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAt the point, he entered into formal ministry, Timothy probably possessed little pastoral training, therefore his role in ministry was necessarily limited. He labored under Paul&rsquo;s direction and under the watchful eye of elders, who guided him. In fact, Timothy was so young that Paul once told Timothy:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 4:12&nbsp;Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who believe.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nTherefore, we should expect that every man answering a call to enter pastoral ministry will begin ministering even before they complete training. In fact,&nbsp;the training and preparation for ministry must continue on without ceasing for as long as the man&nbsp;serves. This&nbsp;expectation contradicts the modern notion that a few years in seminary is sufficient preparation for a pastor. Seminary training can be helpful, of course, but it is merely the&nbsp;starting point in a man&#39;s&nbsp;preparation for serving&nbsp;God&#39;s people in&nbsp;ministry, and if a man can gain his start in seminary, then he could also&nbsp;begin his training by&nbsp;other means (like Timothy).&nbsp;There is simply no such thing as &ldquo;one-stop shopping&rdquo; for pastor preparation.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nNotice, Paul tells Timothy to take pains (i.e., take care) with these things. Paul is saying that what was&nbsp;entrusted&nbsp;to Timothy spiritually was now his to care for and grow within himself through the power of the Spirit. Though Timothy was called and anointed, he was still called to nurture what he has received.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPaul goes even further telling&nbsp;Timothy to be absorbed in his mission of preparation so that his progress in knowledge and godliness would be evident to others. Paul&nbsp;encourages&nbsp;Timothy to make his life&rsquo;s mission growing as a pastor and teacher&nbsp;and to be so dedicated to this task that his progress is obvious. Once again, Paull&#39;s&nbsp;instructions challenge anyone&nbsp;who would think that&nbsp;a seminary education alone qualifies a man for&nbsp;ministry.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, Paul places an emphasis on Timothy&#39;s personal character and the content of his teaching. A pastor and teacher must persevere in protecting his testimony is both areas, which is itself a part of the preparation for ministry. Notice how Paul ends v.16. He tells Timothy that his effectiveness in ministering the Gospel will depend on his willingness to guard and mature what he has been given by God.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nSo whatever means the Lord may use to prepare a man into ministry, ultimately that man must be called, anointed and taught of the Spirit. He must be confirmed and discipled by elders, and he must take on a lifetime of diligent learning and preparation to meet the challenges that the ministry will bring.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

The full passage in Hebrews reads:</span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:19&nbsp; Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:20 by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:22 let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:24 and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:25 not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:26&nbsp; For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:27 but a terrifying expectation of judgment and THE FURY OF A FIRE WHICH WILL CONSUME THE ADVERSARIES.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:28 Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:29 How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Heb. 10:30 For we know Him who said, &ldquo;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s establish the audience this writer is addressing with his teaching. Notice in v.19 the writer calls his audience &ldquo;brethren,&rdquo; and throughout the passage he uses the pronoun &ldquo;we&rdquo; to associate himself with his audience. In v.23, he asks his audience to &ldquo;hold fast&rdquo; to their confession of faith. In v.25, he mentions the Christian gathering, which his audience participates in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Taking all these details together, we must conclude the writer is speaking to an audience he assumes to be Christian. Therefore, we must also conclude that his warning is not speaking to matters that involve unbelievers, including unbelievers who have joined a congregation without actually professing faith (e.g., these have made a confession according to v.23).</p>\n\n<p>Having established that the audience is believers, we then ask what is the writer&rsquo;s concern? In v.22, the writer seems concerned that his audience lacks &ldquo;full assurance&rdquo; that their faith in Christ is sufficient to cleanse them from their sin. This group seems to be wavering (v.23) in their hope of resurrection, probably because they still find some attraction in the sacrifices and ritual of the Old Covenant Law. The writer has just spent four chapters (7-10) explaining the superiority and sufficiency of the New Covenant, which indicates this group of believers had maintained an unhealthy devotion to Jewish ritual.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the writer exhorts these believers to hold fast to their confession of faith in Christ and to cease forsaking the Christian gathering (vs.23-24). Apparently, these believers were returning to the temple and to Jewish religious practice rather than holding firm to their Christian profession. They had forsaken gathering with Christians so that they could gather with Jews instead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The writer tells his audience this is a dangerous practice, one that has serious eternal consequences. If his audience goes on sinning (in this manner) after having received the knowledge that such behavior is improper and unnecessary (v.26), there is no longer a provision of animal sacrifices to cover this error. While the sin is forgiven on the cross, there is no mechanism to avoid the consequences of sin brought by God the Father upon His disobedient children.</p>\n\n<p>The writer uses the Old Testament example of disobedience under the Law to prove his point. When a Jew consciously disobeyed the Law of Moses, they were subject to death if 2 or more witnesses confirmed their disobedience. Given the greater power and importance of the New Covenant, the writer asks the readers to consider what kind of punishment the Lord will exact against those who willfully disobey the requirements of the New Covenant?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In other words, if Christians persist in participating in dead rituals at the Jewish temple while knowing that the Old Covenant has no power to save or atone for sin, then they are willingly sinning against the Savior Who bought them. Consequently, they should expect the Lord will bring stern consequences for any believer who fails to heed His commandments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Notice in v.29 the writer says such disobedience is equal to &ldquo;trampling&rdquo; the Son of God, and regarding as unclean the blood of the covenant and insulting the Spirit. These are serious offenses, and so the Christian who engages in such things should expect the Father to respond in a serious way to such disobedience. &nbsp;Also, notice in v.30 the writer reminds his audience from the Old Testament that the Lord has declared He will take vengeance on His people when He judges them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The writer alludes to the consequences in a couple of verses. First, in v.27 the writer mentions the terrifying nature of God&rsquo;s fury, and in v.30 the writer mentions a judgment God will bring upon His people.&nbsp;So what are the consequences for willfully sinning in this way? What is this fire that will consume (v.27)?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Though the writer of Hebrews doesn&rsquo;t explain it here, these things are explained elsewhere in scripture. Paul says in 1Corinthians that every believer must stand for judgment before Christ, and that judgment will test the quality of their life&rsquo;s work:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:10&nbsp; According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:11 For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:12 Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:13 each man&rsquo;s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:14 If any man&rsquo;s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:15 If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:16&nbsp; Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:17 If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul is describing the moment of every believer&rsquo;s judgment before God. This judgment will evaluate our service to Christ and our life of obedience. The outcome of the judgment is reward, but for those who fail to work as God expected, the result will be loss of reward. Notice the mention of a judgment &ldquo;fire&rdquo; in v.13 and the warning against destroying the temple of God? These references are similar to the statements made by the writer of Hebrews, leading us to conclude that the warning in Hebrews 10 is to fear the judgment of Christ and the potential loss of reward.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>When we have strayed from God, how do we return to a place of intimacy with the Him?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is a common question for the believer, who though saved by the Lord Jesus Christ, continues to&nbsp;sin.&nbsp;No Christian is immune to sin. Despite our best intentions and efforts to avoid&nbsp;failure, we still sin. As a result, we may find ourselves without joy and seemingly far from God as we live in the flesh and not in the Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible affirms this experience, when it declares \"What person can say, &lsquo;I have cleansed my heart, I am pure from my sin&#39;&rdquo;? (Prov. 20:9). &nbsp;No one is ever free from sin in this life, &ldquo;Indeed, there is not a&nbsp;righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins&rdquo; (Eccl. 7:20). Though we have been saved from the penalty of sin, continued sin in our life (i.e., straying from the Lord) still has a negative impact on our relationship with God during our earthly life. Sin interrupts our fellowship with&nbsp;Him, in the sense that it is a reflection of living in our flesh rather than in the Spirit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, our sin doesn&rsquo;t sever our relationship with God, which is eternal and can&rsquo;t be broken because Christ has secured it.&nbsp;Our relationship with God is unbreakable, yet our fellowship with Him can be interrupted.&nbsp;One is&nbsp;unconditional; the other is&nbsp;conditional. Our abiding in Him is an act of the will (see John 15).</p>\n\n<p>The first step to a restored relationship with Christ following a period of wandering or disobedience is a confession of sin and a repentance to walk differently in the future. Confession is made easier when we remember 1John 1:19:</p>\n\n<h5>1 John 1:9 - If we&nbsp;confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous&nbsp;to forgive us&nbsp;our sins and&nbsp;to&nbsp;cleanse&nbsp;us&nbsp;from all unrighteousness.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Understanding God&rsquo;s willingness to forgive is essential to walking back to him. Remember, the Prodigal Son returned to his father because of his recognition that his father was kind and forgiving.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, rededicate yourself to a life of Bible study, prayer and fellowship with like-minded believers.&nbsp;The word of God teaches us the importance of patience and diligence and sacrifice, as we look forward to the Kingdom. It draws our attention to our problems and weaknesses and onto His power and promises.&nbsp;Prayer brings us closer to the Lord, so we may hear from Him more clearly. And fellowship offers the opportunity for accountability, godly counsel and encouragement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These spiritual disciples become &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; against further disobedience, wandering and despair. They grow us up in the grace and knowledge of Christ so that we might withstand the temptations of the enemy and not grow weary in the battle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As we grow spiritually, we will come to value a pursuit of righteousness more and more, and consequently, sin will diminish over time. But sin will never completely&nbsp;disappear from our lives.&nbsp;Sin is every present to some degree, so must remain vigilant against its effects. Otherwise, it stands ready at all times to rob us of our joy in Christ by cutting us off from fellowship with Him. By confessing our sins to the Lord and taking up the full armor of God, we can truly know the cleansing of&nbsp;His blood and be restored in fellowship with Him.</p>"

The answer is the Bible never makes a connection between the timing of the resurrection and the start of Tribulation except that the resurrection must occur first. In other words, the Bible never specifies how much time must pass between the resurrection of the church and the start of the Tribulation. It could be a short time, but it could also be a very long time. We don&rsquo;t know.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible makes no claims for how long the world will wait after the resurrection of the Church before the appearing of the antichrist and the start of Tribulation.&nbsp;While most Bible scholars assume there will only be a short gap of time between the resurrection and the start of Tribulation, it is possible for the two events to be spaced many years apart. The only thing we know is the resurrection is&nbsp;imminent&nbsp;and must come first.</p>\n\n<p>The rise of a ten-ruler government could also happen at any time. It is not dependent on the resurrection either. These rulers could rise to power before the resurrection of the Church or after the resurrection.&nbsp;So, the resurrection could happen at any time, and the rise of the ten rulers could happen at any time. Following the arrival of the ten rulers and the resurrection of the church, then the antichrist will be revealed and the Tribulation may begin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you want to hear the full details of this sequence, we highly encourage you to listen to our Revelation Bible study, available for free <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">here</a>.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>I recently listened to your teaching \"The Great Exchange\" and I understood you to say that we had to be willing to accept God&#39;s Gift, that our acceptance was necessary to the process. I am now confused, can a person reject or delay salvation by their own will when God has elected them to it?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, the Bible teaches that God predestines and elects those who will believe in the Gospel. He gives the gift of faith by the regeneration of the Holy Spirit, causing a person to be born again and to confess Christ. This is the clear teaching of scripture, and nothing you heard in <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_great_exchange\">The Great Exchange</a>&nbsp;contradicts this truth. In fact, if you have not already heard his recent teaching from John 6 on this point, we encourage you to listen to <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-studies/the-gospel-of-john\">Lesson 6C</a>&nbsp;to see how these two truths work together in God&#39;s economy.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is another essential step in the process by which the Lord delivers salvation to His children: His call. Notice how Paul explains the process in Romans 8:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:29 For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:30 and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul lays out the&nbsp;divinely-driven&nbsp;chain of events that results in a person entering into the light of salvation. That chain begins with the Father&rsquo;s predestining of His elect and it ends with the Father&nbsp;glorifying those who are&nbsp;in Christ. But notice the second step in that process: the call. At the right time, according to the Father&rsquo;s purpose, a divinely authored call will be made to those the Father purposes to save.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The call is the moment when an unbeliever is presented with the truth of the Gospel and is commanded to repent and believe so as to be saved. God may choose to deliver His call by a voice or through the written word, by radio or television&nbsp;programs, over the&nbsp;Internet or through the testimony of a family member or friend. The call might be made by a pastor issuing an invitation from the pulpit or from a street preacher handing out Gospel pamphlets. However the call comes, it will only be effective&nbsp;because the Holy Spirit is working to unite the call of the Gospel with faith in the heart of those God elects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So when you heard Pastor Armstrong preaching &ldquo;The Great Exchange,&rdquo; you heard him delivering the call of the Gospel. That call is always made with an appeal and a command. It urges a response and it explains that the nature of the response is an acceptance of the truth of the message. A person must confess with their mouth and believe in their heart, as Paul says in Romans 10:9, so the call is designed to put the person in a position to act.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, a proper call makes no attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff in advance of a response nor do we complicate our message unnecessarily with fine points of Christian doctrine. For example, we don&rsquo;t call people to &ldquo;repent and believe in the Gospel, but only if you are a member of God&rsquo;s elect.&rdquo; Similarly, we don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;God has the plan to save some of you, but the rest of you have no hope. In the end, it&rsquo;s totally up to God anyway.&rdquo; &nbsp;Obviously, these two &ldquo;calls&rdquo; are neither effective nor appropriate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we issue a call like those Paul gave. Scripture says Paul reasoned with men in&nbsp;the synagogues and on the streets of Athens. He debated, argued over and over again. He made every effort to convince his detractors of the truth of the Gospel, knowing that some would&nbsp;believe while others would not, according to God&rsquo;s gracious choice. Consider Paul&rsquo;s own words about his approach:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 5:11&nbsp;Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The same Paul who taught God&rsquo;s predestining and election of all who believe also said that he worked to persuade men to accept the Gospel. Obviously, Paul saw nothing contradictory in persuading men to believe while also acknowledging the truth that only those who God elects will respond affirmatively.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, in our Easter message, we&nbsp;urge&nbsp;the audience to believe in the Gospel and receive the free gift of salvation offered in Christ, which is the call salvation. We issue&nbsp;this call confident that this is the Lord&rsquo;s will that we declare&nbsp;His truth before men, yet we also recognizes that any response that may follow is the result of the Holy Spirit moving hearts in keeping with God&rsquo;s sovereign plan.</p>"

Some examples include the NKJV, the NASB, the HCSB, the NET and even the NIV, which has its detractors.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Secondly, t</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">he Bible itself says that if scripture is too difficlut for someone to understand, it isn&#39;t because the language is obtuse. Instead, the Bible says it&#39;s because the student does&nbsp;not have the Holy Spirit working in him to reveal the meaning:</span></p>\n\n<h6>2Cor. 4:3 And even if our&nbsp; gospel is&nbsp; veiled, it is veiled&nbsp; to&nbsp; those who are perishing,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Cor. 4:4 in whose case&nbsp; the god of&nbsp; this&nbsp; world has&nbsp; blinded the minds of the unbelieving&nbsp; so that they might not see the&nbsp; light of the gospel of the&nbsp; glory of Christ, who is the&nbsp; image of God.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 1:18 &nbsp;For the word of the cross is&nbsp; foolishness to&nbsp; those who&nbsp; are perishing, but to us who&nbsp; are being saved it is&nbsp; the power of God.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In reality, the Lord doesn&rsquo;t need men to make His words more \"readable.\" The Spirit is more than capable of bringing an understanding to anyone as the Lord wills and as we devote ourselves to study of&nbsp;it. This is why we have been given the Spirit, as Jesus said:</span></p>\n\n<h6>John 14:26 &ldquo;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit,&nbsp; whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>We can&#39;t \"dumb down\" the text of scripture hoping to take a shortcut to an&nbsp;understanding of things that only God can reveal according to His sovereign will and timing. We must be prepared to study the Bible over our lifetime, so that the Lord can deliver the full sense of &nbsp;the&nbsp;text to our hearts when He desires. Meanwhile, we will be growing in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ, which is the point of our study. Making an investment to a lifetime&nbsp;process of personal Bible study is more important than any particular&nbsp;understanding gleened from a moment of study.</p>\n\n<p>For personal study, we&nbsp;recommend using&nbsp;the New American Standard Bible or the New English Translation (<a href=\"http://www.bible.org\">http://www.bible.org</a>) or any other accurate translation of the original texts. These translations best preserve the words as God delivered them, so then the Holy Spirit may explain the meaning as God intended.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Can a Christian be indwelled by a demon? For example, when Jesus called Peter \"Satan\" in Matthew 16, did that indicate Peter was possessed by a demon or Satan?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nIn Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel we read:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 16:21&nbsp;&nbsp;From that time&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus began to show His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and&nbsp;&nbsp;suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day.&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 16:22&nbsp;Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, &ldquo;&nbsp;God forbid it, Lord! This shall never&nbsp;&nbsp;happen to You.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nMatt. 16:23&nbsp;But He turned and said to Peter, &ldquo;Get behind Me,&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on&nbsp;&nbsp;God&rsquo;s interests, but man&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In this exchange, Jesus responded&nbsp;to Peter&rsquo;s suggestion that He not go forward with the Father&#39;s plan to send His Son to die on the cross. Obviously, Peter didn&#39;t understand what he was saying, nevertheless&nbsp;Jesus rebuked Peter for tempting Him to disobey the Father. Jesus told Peter his advice furthered the desires and&nbsp;purposes of&nbsp;Satan rather than the Father.</span></p>\n\n<p>By the context, we see that when Jesus said to Peter,&nbsp;&ldquo;Get behind Me,&nbsp;Satan,&rdquo; Jesus wasn&rsquo;t literally addressing Peter as if Satan were resident in Peter&rsquo;s body. Rather, Jesus was calling Peter Satan to teach Peter that his desires&nbsp;supported Satan&#39;s purposes. Perhaps also Jesus was indicating that Satan was behind the scenes influencing&nbsp;Peter&rsquo;s thinking and words. In either case, Jesus meant that&nbsp;Peter was not speaking by the Spirit nor was He speaking in agreement with the word of God. Rather, Peter was echoing the words and purposes of Satan.</p>\n\n<p>This example reminds us that&nbsp;believers can unknowingly support&nbsp;Satan&#39;s goals by living in our flesh and not by the Spirit. Furthermore, all people&nbsp;(whether believer or unbeliever) can be manipulated by Satan without necessarily requiring that a demon indwell a person. The enemy is very powerful, and his power includes&nbsp;tempting believers, delivering false teaching, and even influencing our thoughts and emotions in opposition to God.</p>\n\n<p>None of these influences requires an indwelling.&nbsp;Scriptures say that every believer can be tempted by Satan or even taught by him. For example:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 7:5&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and&nbsp;&nbsp;come together again so that&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan will not&nbsp;tempt&nbsp;you because of your lack of self-control.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 10:13&nbsp;No&nbsp;temptation&nbsp;has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and&nbsp;&nbsp;God is faithful, who will not allow you to be&nbsp;&nbsp;tempted&nbsp;beyond what you are able, but with the&nbsp;temptation&nbsp;will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><br />\n1Th. 3:5&nbsp;For this reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;when I could endure it no longer, I also&nbsp;&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;&nbsp;find out about your faith, for fear that&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;tempter&nbsp;might have&nbsp;tempted&nbsp;you, and&nbsp;&nbsp;our labor would be in vain.&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 6:9&nbsp;&nbsp;But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and&nbsp;&nbsp;a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><br />\n2Cor. 2:10&nbsp;But one whom you forgive anything, I forgive also; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of Christ,&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 2:11&nbsp;so that no advantage would be taken of us by&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan, for&nbsp;&nbsp;we are not ignorant of his schemes.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nFinally, scripture teaches&nbsp;that once the Holy Spirit resides in our bodies (because of our faith in Jesus Christ), we are forever sealed by the Holy Spirit and no longer accessible to the enemy for indwelling:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 12:43&nbsp; &ldquo;&nbsp;Now when the unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and does not find it.<br />\nMatt. 12:44&nbsp;&ldquo;Then it says, &lsquo;I will return to my house from which I came&rsquo;; and when it comes, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order.<br />\nMatt. 12:45&nbsp;&ldquo;Then it goes and takes along with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there; and&nbsp;&nbsp;the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. That is the way it will also be with this evil generation.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nJesus was explaining that were God to free someone from demon possession yet not deliver saving faith, He would have done little to help them. As long as a person&nbsp;remains &ldquo;unoccupied&rdquo; by the absence of the Holy Spirit (which is the case for all unbelievers), then that person will be&nbsp;available to host the enemy&rsquo;s agents.&nbsp;Only if a body becomes occupied (e.g., indwelled by the Holy Spirit) is that person safe from the enemy ever returning to set up a home in the body again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>By logical deduction, we must also conclude that once we become a Christian, we are no longer susceptible to demon possession, though the enemy can still tempt, deceive and influence us in negative ways when we live in the flesh and not in the Spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. I heard Christian symbols have pagan origins. &nbsp;Is is wrong to wear a cross or other symbol?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. In the Law given to Israel, the Lord commanded &nbsp;in Exodus 20:4-6:</p>\n\n<h6>You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. &nbsp;You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This commandment prohibited the sin of idolatry, worshipping graven images. A graven image is a likeness of God, and anything we might imagine to represent God will be - by necessity - incomplete and insufficient. The Creator of Heavens and Earth cannot be compared with His Creation.&nbsp;Furthermore, the context&nbsp;of the commandment is that we are not to make such an object</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> for the express purpose of worship</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>We know that the making of an image&nbsp;of Heaven by itself is not sinful, since&nbsp;God Himself commanded Moses to make cherubim (angels) that were on the top of the Ark of the Covenant. He also commanded Moses to make a bronze serpent that the Israelites were to look at so they&rsquo;d be healed if they were bitten by the poisonous snakes God sent to punish them (Numbers 21). God&#39;s concern was making an image for the purpose of worshipping it (as the Israelites did in the desert &nbsp;in Exodus 32).</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Hezekiah ended up destroying the bronze serpent because eventually the Israelites did begin to worship it (1 Kings 18).&nbsp;So, we see that making an image of something is not in and of itself against God&rsquo;s commandment. Importantly, as a side note, Christians are not under the Mosaic Law; however, this same law overlaps commandments we receive in the New Testament that expressly forbid idolatry (e.g., 1 Corinthians 10:14).</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, we read in Genesis 24 that Rebekah is given a ring and bracelets when she is chosen to be Isaac&rsquo;s wife. &nbsp;1Peter 3:3-4 says,</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;Your adornment must not be merely external--braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses; but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Adornment here is not prohibited, but it is to be modest so that a woman&rsquo;s spiritual adornment from God can be seen. &nbsp;A similar command is given in 1 Timothy 2:9-10.</span></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we see that God&rsquo;s word allows for us to wear jewelry, which would include a cross, chi-rho, fish, or Trinity sign, whether worn on our person or on our car. &nbsp;Having said that, there are things to consider before wearing such jewelry or putting them on our cars.</p>\n\n<p>First, if we fellowship regularly with a Christian brother or sister who (incorrectly) believes that wearing such jewelry is sinful, then we should not wear the jewelry for the sake of our weaker (in the faith) brother or sister. &nbsp;This is clearly stated as a commandment in Romans 14.</p>\n\n<p>Second, and this is my opinion (based on God&rsquo;s word) rather than God&rsquo;s explicit word, we should be careful about putting such symbols on our car or wearing such jewelry. &nbsp;People understand what the fish symbol means, and what the cross means. &nbsp;If our witness is such that we do things that are not Christ-like, people are much more apt to have a negative view of Christianity, and God is not glorified. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, my pastor, who is an ex-policeman, tells the story of the lady he pulled over for speeding. &nbsp;He had been trying to witness to his partner about Christ. &nbsp;When they proceeded to give the lady a speeding ticket, she began spewing profanity because she was angry that she got caught speeding. &nbsp;Yet, she had a Christian fish symbol on her car, which my pastor&rsquo;s partner noticed. &nbsp;In this way, the lady set a poor example of what a Christian looks like. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The point here is that when we &ldquo;advertise&rdquo; that we are a Christian, we better be the real deal, or else the world thinks we are fake, just like everyone else. &nbsp;Better to let our good works shine before men so that our Father in heaven is glorified. &nbsp;Indeed, that is the point in both the 1 Peter and 1 Timothy passages cited above.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, it is not sinful to wear a cross or put Christian symbols on our cars, as long as we do not worship them, making them an idol. &nbsp;Also, we are to take into consideration how other Christians with whom we regularly fellowship view this, so as not to sear their conscience. &nbsp;Finally, we need to be imitators of Christ, walking as He walked. &nbsp;Wearing these symbols makes that all the more important.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Is gambling (whether online or in a casino setting) sinful or immoral?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The Bible is silent on many practices of daily life because life is filled with an infinite variety of circumstances. Nevertheless, the Bible does present principles for living righteously so that we can make reasonable inferences and trust the Holy Spirit to guide us in specific circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>The topic of gambling is an example of one such activity that must be addressed on principle. The Bible is silent on whether gambling is wrong. At times, the Bible shows ungodly men participating in gambling (e.g., Roman soldiers casting lots for Jesus&#39; clothing in Matt 27:35). On the other hand, the Bible also shows godly people relying on an ancient form of gambling called casting lots (or die) to discern God&#39;s will concerning a decision (e.g., when the Apostles cast lots or dice to determine who should replace Judas in Acts 1:26).<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/med-1047-gambling.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px 15px; float: left; width: 250px; height: 161px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>So,&nbsp;the Bible never explicitly states that games of chance are&nbsp;sin, and therefore we must conclude that a Christian has liberty with regard to this practice. A Christian might attend a friendly poker game with friends, even games where real money is at stake, and a&nbsp;Christian might patronize a&nbsp;local gambling resort for entertainment. A Christian might even travel to participate in a professional&nbsp;gambling tournament for large winnings. All these activities are amoral (i.e., not inherently sinful).</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;there are principles of scripture that guide our decisions and may lead us to reconsider our participation in such things. Consider what&nbsp;Paul teaches in <a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\">1Corinthians</a>&nbsp;10:23:</p>\n\n<h6>All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify.</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nIn other words, gambling may be permissible but is it profitable or advisable&nbsp;for a Christian?</p>\n\n<p>In many cases - perhaps in the majority of cases - the answer may be no. While the simple pastime of playing cards&nbsp;is not immoral or sinful, our participation in these activities does not take place&nbsp;in a vacuum. Our decisions occur in an environment and culture that impacts and is impacted by our decisions.</p>\n\n<p>For example, most forms of gambling&nbsp;encourages &ndash;&nbsp;and even depends upon &ndash;&nbsp;stimulating a love of money, and the Bible clearly teaches that the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil (1Tim 6:10). When we gamble, are we tolerating a&nbsp;pursuit of the love of money? If so, then we are standing on&nbsp;dangerous ground in our walk as a Christian.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, casinos&nbsp;typically&nbsp;entice gamblers with&nbsp;various ungodly activities&nbsp;intended to incite&nbsp;lust and debauchery. Some casinos feature legalized prostitution and some are thought to be associated with organized crime. Even in more innocent settings like a neighborhood poker game, gambling can be accompanied by excessive alcohol use, course language, gossip, and many other kinds of ungodly behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Our participation in gambling may not be sinful in itself, but we must carefully consider the full scope of our involvement before deciding if our participation will be free from sin. Can we be sure that we won&#39;t be tempted to fall into a love of money? Can we sure we won&#39;t engage in other forms of sinful behavior due to the influence of the setting or people around us? Can we be certain that our participation isn&#39;t lending our financial support directly to institutions that promote ungodliness as a part of their business? And what of our Christian witness to others in the faith who know of our gambling as Christians?</p>\n\n<p>Since gambling brings many potential pitfalls that do not edify the believer,&nbsp;we strongly recommend against believers engaging in any gambling activity, including playing lotteries or participating in friendly poker games with the buddies. These activities are not sin by themselves, but they often bring sin into our lives in other ways, and gambling must be approached with great caution if we are to avoid falling into sin.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Please explain what the Bible means when it says that Lazarus&#39; sickness was not to end in death since we know the sickness did kill him.&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We find that statement&nbsp;in John 11:4. Here is the entire passage from John 11 describing Lazarus&#39; death:</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 2 It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 3 So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.&rdquo; 4 But when Jesus heard this, He said, &ldquo;This sickness is not to end in death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.&rdquo; 5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 6 So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was. 7 Then after this He said to the disciples, &ldquo;Let us go to Judea again.&rdquo; 8 The disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?&rdquo; 9 Jesus answered, &ldquo;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. 10 But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&rdquo; 11 This He said, and after that He said to them, &ldquo;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, so that I may awaken him out of sleep.&rdquo; 12 The disciples then said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&rdquo; 13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep. 14 So Jesus then said to them plainly, &ldquo;Lazarus is dead, 15 and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him.&rdquo; 16 Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, &ldquo;Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As we read, Mary and Martha&rsquo;s brother, Lazarus, became&nbsp;sick.&nbsp;His sickness was obviously quite serious, or else they would not have sent for Jesus to heal him.&nbsp;Jesus, who knows all things, clearly knew that Lazarus would die if He did not heal him.&nbsp;Jesus chose not to heal him for one clear reason:&nbsp;so that God and His Son would be glorified, and so that the disciples would believe in Him.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Although Lazarus was clearly killed by his sickness, the reason his sickness was not to &ldquo;end in death&rdquo; was because Jesus knew what He was going to do.&nbsp;It was God&rsquo;s will that Lazarus would die from this sickness so that Jesus would raise him up from the grave.&nbsp;In so doing, God and His Son would be glorified, and the miracle would cause the disciples to believe in who Jesus was.&nbsp; </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We see something similar in John 9 when Jesus heals the blind man.&nbsp;Scripture says he was born blind that works of God may be displayed in him.&nbsp;In these examples (and others), we are made aware of God&rsquo;s complete sovereignty over our lives.&nbsp;Jeremiah 18 describes Israel as clay in the potter&rsquo;s (God&rsquo;s) hands, which is echoed in Romans 9.&nbsp; The Lord has complete control over our lives, including even being able to raise us from the dead.</span></p>\n\n<p>Reading further in John 11, we see how Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead:</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;17 So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days. 18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off; 19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. 20 Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary stayed at the house. 21 Martha then said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. 22 Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.&rdquo; 23 Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Your brother will rise again.&rdquo; 24 Martha said to Him, &ldquo;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.&rdquo; 25 Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies, 26 and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?&rdquo; 27 She said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, even He who comes into the world.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Reading further, we see how Lazarus is raised:</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;38 So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. 39 Jesus said, &ldquo;Remove the stone.&rdquo; Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days.&rdquo; 40 Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?&rdquo; 41 So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, &ldquo;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. 42 I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me.&rdquo; 43 When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lazarus, come forth.&rdquo; 44 The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Unbind him, and let him go.&rdquo;&nbsp; 45 Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him. 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It has been said that if Jesus had not said &ldquo;Lazarus&nbsp;come forth!&rdquo;, but only said &ldquo;Come forth!&rdquo;, then all the dead would have arisen!&nbsp; In this passage, Jesus clearly demonstrates that He is God by raising Lazarus from the dead.&nbsp;This is a beautiful picture of the resurrection that all believers will ultimately experience the power of God.&nbsp; </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As our Lord says, he who believes in Him will live, even if he dies.&nbsp;Just as we are bound by sin while we are spiritually dead, once God gives us faith and causes us to be spiritually born (&ldquo;born again&rdquo;), God unbinds the chords of sin that ensnare us.&nbsp;It is in this sense that when Jesus says when the Son sets you free, you are free indeed (John 8:36).</span></p>\n\n<p>Like Lazarus, we have a resurrection to which we can look forward.&nbsp; While Lazarus&rsquo; resurrection in John 11 was temporary (Lazarus eventually died), our resurrection will be with a new body.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Paul explains this in 1 Corinthians 15:</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;50 Now I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. 51 Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, 52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 53 For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality. 54 But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, &ldquo;Death is swallowed up in victory. 55 O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?&rdquo; 56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; 57 but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We will lose this mortal, perishable body and put on an immortal, imperishable body.&nbsp;This will happen because death has been conquered by our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.&nbsp;May we bring glory to Him until then, and forever more.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Is Hebrews 6:4-6 describing&nbsp;a believer or an unbeliever? The passage sounds like it&#39;s speaking of&nbsp;</strong></em><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong>a believer, but then it also seems to say a person can lose their salvation, which I thought wasn&#39;t possible. Help me understand this passage properly.</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The passage you quoted is taken from a longer discussion beginning in Hebrews 5, so we must consider the full context&nbsp;in order to interpret the writer&#39;s comments properly.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">To begin, we find the writer speaking to believers at various points in his discourse, including in Hebrews&nbsp;6:1, when the writer calls upon his audience to press on to maturity in their faith:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Heb. 6:1&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp;leaving&nbsp;the&nbsp;elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to&nbsp;maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God.</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Clearly, only believers \"press on\" to maturity. Unbelievers cannot mature in a faith they have never accepted in the first place. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Earlier in chapter 5&nbsp;the writer chastised&nbsp;his audience for not working hard enough to&nbsp;progress beyond simplistic notions&nbsp;and toward mature understandings of God&#39;s word:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Heb. 5:12 &nbsp;For though&nbsp;&nbsp;by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you&nbsp;&nbsp;the elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">Obviously, the writer would never expect unbelievers to become teachers of the word!&nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;his statements must be directed toward&nbsp;believers. So&nbsp;as we move into the passage in chapter 6, we must keep in mind that the author is speaking <em>to believers</em> with a warning&nbsp;<em>for believers</em>.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">Moving to&nbsp;the passage under consideration, the writer now explains the consequences of a Christian not pressing on to spiritual maturity:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Heb. 6:4 &nbsp;For in the case of those who have once been&nbsp;&nbsp;enlightened and have tasted of&nbsp;&nbsp;the heavenly gift and have been made&nbsp;&nbsp;partakers of the Holy Spirit,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:5 &nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;have tasted the good&nbsp;&nbsp;word of God and the powers of&nbsp;&nbsp;the age to come,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:6 &nbsp;and then have fallen away, it is&nbsp;&nbsp;impossible to renew them again to repentance,&nbsp;since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:7 &nbsp;For ground that drinks the rain which often&nbsp;&nbsp;falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those&nbsp;&nbsp;for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:8 &nbsp;but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and&nbsp;close&nbsp;to being cursed, and&nbsp;it ends up being burned.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The writer is describing the consequences of a Christian not \"pressing on to maturity\" as he commanded in v.1. He defines a Christian&nbsp;in vs.4-5 using a list of&nbsp;experiences. Notice&nbsp;these experiences are common to every Christian but would be&nbsp;unfamiliar to unbelievers.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The list mentions becoming enlightened (i.e., coming to know the truth of the Gospel), becoming&nbsp;a partaker of the Holy Spirit and tasting (i.e., experiencing) the word of God and the powers of the Spirit. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">These are characteristics of every&nbsp;believer&#39;s life, yet they have no place in an unbeliever&#39;s experience. Some Bible teachers overemphasize certain words in this description to force a&nbsp;conclusion that the writer is describing an unbeliever, but the experiences in the list&nbsp;(as well as&nbsp;the overall context of the passage)&nbsp;precludes such an&nbsp;interpretation.&nbsp;The&nbsp;writer provides this list to emphasize the <em>certainty</em>&nbsp;of the believer&#39;s faith, which makes his warning all the more sobering.</span></p>\n\n<p>Because of&nbsp;the certainty of his faith,&nbsp;a believer who&nbsp;falls&nbsp;away&nbsp;cannot be&nbsp;renewed \"again\" to repentance.&nbsp;Simply put, there is no second salvation moment for a believer. Our salvation experience of repenting from a&nbsp;life of sin and turning to&nbsp;the Gospel is a once-in-a-lifetime event. Our salvation is secure for eternity, so there is simply no way for God to&nbsp;repeat this process. Therefore,&nbsp;no believer should test the Lord&#39;s patience&nbsp;by indulging in&nbsp;a life&nbsp;of sin with the expectation that the Lord will offer a second chance to repent and escape such a lifestyle.</p>\n\n<p>What is the consequence for a believer who falls&nbsp;away? Once again, some interpreters has misunderstood the meaning of&nbsp;\"falling away\" to imply a loss of salvation, but&nbsp;the Bible uses the term&nbsp;falling away to describe&nbsp;believers failing to achieve spiritual&nbsp;maturity through the study and application of God&#39;s word and instead&nbsp;falling away (i.e., returning) to&nbsp;the sinful life they lived prior to faith. T<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">his is a falling away of behavior and thought, but it is not a loss of salvation.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In fact, the whole counsel of God&#39;s word emphasizes&nbsp;that a believer&#39;s eternal security is assured by the Spirit and cannot be \"lost\" through our sinful behaviors (</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">see&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans 8</a></em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">).&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">(For a longer discussion of this issue, please read the article&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/bible-answers/can_i_lose_my_salvation\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Can I Lose My Salvation</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">?)</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;We can see this clearly in the writer&#39;s conclusion.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The writer uses&nbsp;a parable to illustrate the consequences for falling away. The</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;writer compares a believer who falls away to farm land (ground) that receives rain falling from the sky. Falling rain is commonly used in the Bible as a picture of God&#39;s grace extended to men (<em>see Isaiah 44:3; James 5:7</em>). God extends His common grace to both believers and unbelievers (<em>see Matt 5:45</em>), but this parable is clearly describing the unique grace extended only to believers through their faith&nbsp;in Christ.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The writer says that God&#39;s rain (i.e., saving grace) falls on (i.e.,&nbsp;is granted to)&nbsp;believers,&nbsp;for the purpose of producing useful vegetation (i.e., glorifying works)&nbsp;for the One Who tills the ground&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">(i.e., the Lord). Simply put, the Lord saves&nbsp;Christians with&nbsp;the expectation that we will produce a harvest of good works for His glory&nbsp;(<em>see Matt 5:16</em>).&nbsp;Some believers live to fulfill this purpose while other believers&nbsp;waste God&#39;s&nbsp;grace by producing useless works&nbsp;(i.e., thorns and thistles).&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">These two outcomes are metaphors for the two types of lives believers may choose to live in response to their salvation: either&nbsp;obeying or disobeying their Lord. Some believers devote their lives to serving the Lord and producing spiritual fruit while others become caught up in the cares and pleasures of life, leading them to fall away.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The writer is describing a situation similar to the one illustrated in&nbsp;Jesus&#39; parable of the sower and seed:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Luke 8:14&nbsp;&ldquo;The seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity.<br />\nLuke 8:15&nbsp;&ldquo;But the seed in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with&nbsp;&nbsp;perseverance.<br />\nLuke 8:16&nbsp; &ldquo;Now&nbsp;&nbsp;no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.<br />\nLuke 8:17&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light.<br />\nLuke 8:18&nbsp;&ldquo;So take care how you listen;&nbsp;&nbsp;for whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever does not have, even what he&nbsp;&nbsp;thinks he has shall be taken away from him.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Some interpreters have explained the&nbsp;falling away and the resulting penalty in Hebrews 6 as the consequences&nbsp;for&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">an unbeliever</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> who has been exposed to the Gospel but never accepted it truly. In this interpretative understanding, \"falling away\" describes a rejection of the truth of the Gospel, while the inability to be renewed to repentance describes a&nbsp;loss of any future opportunity to know the Lord. This conclusion does not fit the&nbsp;words or context of the passage, nor does it fit with the overall teaching of scripture.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">First, the Bible never uses the term \"fall away\" (or apostasy) to describe the actions of an unbeliever. It is always used to describe a believer moving away from God. Simply put, an unbeliever cannot fall away from a faith they never possessed&nbsp;in the first place.</span></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we would never say that an&nbsp;unbeliever cannot be be renewed to repentance \"again,\" since&nbsp;an unbeliever by definition has never been renewed to repentance even once. Furthermore, the Bible never teaches that rejecting the Gospel on one occasion eliminates future opportunities to believe and be saved. In fact, scripture teaches that the Lord appoints our day of salvation (e.g., Acts 22:14), so past disobedience is never cause for future disqualification.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Finally, this person&#39;s apostasy is said to put&nbsp;the Lord to \"open shame.\" Putting Christ to open shame refers to publicly humiliating Christ&nbsp;<em>among those who respect&nbsp;and honor&nbsp;Him</em>. The Lord cannot&nbsp;be shamed by the actions of someone who does not possess a relationship with Him.&nbsp;The unbelieving world does not esteem&nbsp;Christ, and unbelievers do not possess a relationship with Christ.&nbsp;Therefore, they have no potential to bring open shame to Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were possible for unbelievers&nbsp;to cast shame upon Christ, then He&nbsp;would be subject to continual shame!&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Only a believer&#39;s actions can shame the Lord within the Church.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, all evidence supports the conclusion that this&nbsp;passage is warning believers of the importance to press&nbsp;on to maturity in the&nbsp;walk of faith&nbsp;and not to fall&nbsp;back to a life of immature or ungodly living.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In v.8, the writer concludes with a description of the&nbsp;judgment that comes upon the unfruitful Christian: he is&nbsp;\"close to being cursed.\" The believer will never be cursed (i.e., damned), because their sin was forgiven on the cross of Christ. Nevertheless,&nbsp;a life of disobedience leaves them \"close\" to being cursed in the sense that their lack of&nbsp;good works results in&nbsp;a testimony only marginally better&nbsp;than that of an&nbsp;unbeliever&#39;s life.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The writer&#39;s conclusion&nbsp;confirms that the person in view is a believer,&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;an unbeliever, because the writer&#39;s statement \"close to being cursed\" cannot be said of&nbsp;unbelievers.&nbsp;</span><u style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">All</u><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;unbelievers live continually under a sentence of condemnation&nbsp;unless and until they confess Christ. Unbelievers are not \"close to being cursed;\" they&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">are</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;cursed every day they live in disobedience to the Gospel (</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">see John 3:18</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">).</span></p>\n\n<p>So&nbsp;what has the disobedient believer placed at risk by falling away?&nbsp;The Bible teaches that disobedient believers forfeit&nbsp;eternal reward for failing to produce good works, as Paul describes in 1Cor 3:</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 3:10&nbsp; According to&nbsp;&nbsp;the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder&nbsp;&nbsp;I laid a foundation, and&nbsp;&nbsp;another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.&nbsp;</span><br />\n1Cor. 3:11&nbsp;For no man can lay a&nbsp;&nbsp;foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 3:12&nbsp;Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver,&nbsp;&nbsp;precious stones, wood, hay, straw,&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 3:13&nbsp;&nbsp;each man&rsquo;s work will become evident; for&nbsp;&nbsp;the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test&nbsp;&nbsp;the quality of each man&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 3:14&nbsp;If any man&rsquo;s work which he has built on it remains, he will&nbsp;&nbsp;receive a reward.&nbsp;<br />\n1Cor. 3:15&nbsp;If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet&nbsp;&nbsp;so as through fire.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Paul emphasizes that a Christian&#39;s failure to serve Christ will results in a judgment of fire that consumes the person&#39;s record of useless works. Though his useless works are burned up, Paul emphasizes that&nbsp;the believer himself is still saved in the end by his faith. Here we find Paul agreeing with the writer of Hebrews in teaching&nbsp;that&nbsp;a believer may experience&nbsp;a severe judgment for falling away, though his salvation remains secure.</span></p>\n\n<p>In summary, the writer of Hebrews is warning that any Christian who does not press on to maturity is in danger of falling away (i.e., returning) to a life of disobedience and unfruitful results. A believer who rebels in this way cannot&nbsp;assume the Lord will grant them another opportunity to turn back from sin and receive a second chance to glorify&nbsp;the Lord.<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Instead, t</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">he</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Lord may choose to leave the&nbsp;believer in his rebellion,&nbsp;so that at the judgment moment the Lord can demonstrate His perfect justice by denying the believer&nbsp;eternal reward. Our best course of action is to serve the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind and strength so as to please Him.</span></p>\n\n<p>For more information on the judgment seat of Christ, we recommend you listen to Lesson 3B in our <a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\">1Corinthians study</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>After listening to your Bible studies, I now understand the importance of attending a church that teaches the whole counsel of God&#39;s word. Unfortunately, my church&nbsp;has changed over the years from&nbsp;teaching the Bible to just entertaining with spiritual junk food. After learning so much from your ministry, I decided to&nbsp;approach&nbsp;my pastor asking him to return to in-depth&nbsp;teaching. He started yelling at me, accused me of challenging his authority. He refused to even consider what I had to say.&nbsp;I don&#39;t know what to do now. Should I leave my church or work to improve it?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nWe are sorry to learn of this difficult situation, but take some comfort in knowing you are not alone. Many churches are drifting away from the church&#39;s mission of discipling the faithful&nbsp;to merely entertaining (or fleecing) the flock. In the Bible, Paul warned of this specific situation in the last days:</p>\n\n<h6>2Tim. 4:1 &nbsp;I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to&nbsp; judge the living and the dead, and by His&nbsp; appearing and His kingdom::<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Tim. 4:2 preach&nbsp; the word; be ready in season and out of season;&nbsp; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with&nbsp; great&nbsp; patience and instruction.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Tim. 4:3 For&nbsp; the time will come when they will not endure&nbsp; sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Tim. 4:4 and&nbsp; will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Tim. 4:1&nbsp; But&nbsp;the Spirit explicitly says that&nbsp;in later times some will&nbsp;fall away from the faith, paying attention to&nbsp;deceitful spirits and&nbsp;doctrines of demons,&nbsp;</span><br />\n1Tim. 4:2&nbsp;by means of the hypocrisy of liars&nbsp;seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron,&nbsp;<br />\n1Tim. 4:3&nbsp;men who&nbsp;forbid marriage and advocate&nbsp;&nbsp;abstaining from foods which&nbsp;God has created to be&nbsp;gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Your pastor sounds like a man fitting Paul&#39;s&nbsp;description in 1Tim 4:2. If he is a \"hypocritical liar seared in his conscience,\" then you are right to avoid him and to leave that church. We commend you for your courage to speak with him in the&nbsp;proper manner, but&nbsp;his response to your correction suggests he is a man&nbsp;living&nbsp;in serious rebellion to the Lord and to the authority of His word. If so, he should not&nbsp;be&nbsp;serving as a pastor, much less as a Bible teacher, and you should separate yourself from his influence if he won&#39;t listen to sound counsel.</span></p>\n\n<p>Whether you stay or leave, you&nbsp;should use the knowledge you have gained in studying God&#39;s word&nbsp;to share the truth to whomever you can, hoping for a positive result. Encourage other believers and set an example in your own behavior and attitude. Avoid becoming disruptive or argumentative, either with the church leadership or with others in the congregation. Seek to correct your leaders in appropriate ways, as you have done, and always speak the truth in love.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Equally importantly, remember that the Lord has ordained the nature of these last days, so we shouldn&#39;t be surprised when our efforts to correct men like your pastor ultimately fail. The word tells us that though God will preserve a remnant, the majority of the Church &ndash; including many leaders &ndash; will succumb to the coming apostasy. Knowing this truth, we must temper our expectations as we confront evil men in the church.</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, do not make it your goal to &ldquo;fix\" a certain church congregation. Rather, make your goal serving the body of Christ universal. When you look past the walls of your local congregation, you will find a world of believers waiting to be taught, encouraged, inspired and led into obedience to Christ.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Remember Jesus&rsquo; words:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Luke 10:3&nbsp;&ldquo;Go;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.<br />\nLuke 10:4&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;Carry no money belt, no&nbsp;&nbsp;bag, no shoes; and greet no one on the way.<br />\nLuke 10:5&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever house you enter, first say, &lsquo;Peace be to this house.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 10:6&nbsp;&ldquo;If a&nbsp;&nbsp;man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him, but if not, it will return to you.<br />\nLuke 10:7&nbsp;&ldquo;Stay in&nbsp;&nbsp;that house, eating and drinking&nbsp;&nbsp;what they give you; for&nbsp;&nbsp;the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not keep moving from house to house.<br />\nLuke 10:8&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever city you enter and they receive you,&nbsp;&nbsp;eat what is set before you;<br />\nLuke 10:9&nbsp;and heal those in it who are sick, and say to them, &lsquo;&nbsp;The kingdom of God has come near to you.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 10:10&nbsp;&ldquo;But whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,<br />\nLuke 10:11&nbsp;&lsquo;&nbsp;Even the dust of your city which clings to our feet we wipe off in protest against you; yet&nbsp;&nbsp;be sure of this, that&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom of God has come near.&rsquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As you work to serve the Lord, don&rsquo;t expect to encounter a receptive audience at every stop. When you inevitably encounter resistance to the word of God, don&rsquo;t beat your head against that closed door. Move on looking for the open doors God has prepared for you elsewhere. This is the biblical form of ministry.</span></p>\n\n<p>By maintaining&nbsp;an informed, biblical perspective on what success looks like in these last days, you guard yourself against disappointments and discouragement. Consider the example of Elijah, who expressed frustration over a lack of revival during a time of apostasy in his day. When Elijah complained to the Lord, God rebuked Elijah, saying:</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Kings 19:11&nbsp; So the Lord said, &ldquo;&nbsp;Go forth and stand on the mountain before the LORD.&rdquo; And behold, the LORD was passing by! And&nbsp;&nbsp;a great and strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.&nbsp;</span><br />\n1Kings 19:12&nbsp;After the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire&nbsp;&nbsp;a sound of a gentle blowing.&nbsp;<br />\n1Kings 19:13&nbsp;When Elijah heard it,&nbsp;&nbsp;he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold,&nbsp;&nbsp;a voice came to him and said, &ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n1Kings 19:14&nbsp;Then he said, &ldquo;&nbsp;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n1Kings 19:15&nbsp; The LORD said to him, &ldquo;Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus, and when you have arrived,&nbsp;&nbsp;you shall anoint Hazael king over Aram;&nbsp;<br />\n1Kings 19:16&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint king over Israel; and&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place.&nbsp;<br />\n1Kings 19:17&nbsp;&ldquo;It shall come about, the&nbsp;&nbsp;one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu&nbsp;&nbsp;shall put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall put to death.&nbsp;<br />\n1Kings 19:18&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;Yet I will leave 7,000 in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not&nbsp;&nbsp;kissed him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">While Elijah was expecting the Lord to work great revival within Israel as a result of Elijah&rsquo;s ministry, the Lord explained to Elijah on the mountain that His purposes were very different. The Lord intended to work quietly, in the background, preserving only a remnant in Israel rather than reviving the whole of Israel. Elijah had set his heart on an unrealistic result, because Elijah hadn&#39;t considered what God had revealed concerning the nature of the days in which he lived.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">(You can learn more by listening to Pastor Armstrong preach from 1Kings 19 in our lesson on <a href=\"/bible-studies/elijahs_disappointment\">Elijah&#39;s Disappointment</a>.)</span></p>\n\n<p>Likewise today, we know from scripture that the church of the last days&nbsp;will be&nbsp;an apostate church. The Lord has told us that in the last days, the church would have only a remnant of believers devoted to His word (like you), therefore He is unlikely to bring revival even as&nbsp;a result of our prayers and efforts. Knowing this truth from scripture, we are to find contentment in the Lord&rsquo;s purposes, choosing to work with Him rather than against Him, while tempering our expectations for success.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, search for the open doors where you can minister to the remnant, and perhaps you will be able to rescue a few more of your brothers and sisters along the way. Consider starting a small study group in your home or a prayer group or some other personal ministry to teach, train, encourage and lead believers to know and obey the word of God.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you will find a church home that upholds the word of God and lives according to it, but you should also be prepared for the possibility that you won&rsquo;t. Regardless, every Christian is called to serve the Lord&rsquo;s people and witness to His truth, and this calling doesn&rsquo;t depend on working within a formal church structure (i.e., a local congregation meeting in a certain building). Such support is helpful, of course, but it can also become an encumbrance, as you have discovered.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We are encouraged to know the Lord is feeding you through our teaching, and we trust you will have an opportunity to share our resources with others who are desperate to discover truth and sincerity in their Christian walk.&nbsp;We believe ministries like VBVMI are a part of God&rsquo;s provision for believers, who have been abandoned and marginalized by corrupt and apostate local churches. Your experience is further confirmation of our belief.&nbsp;</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>I&#39;m having trouble understanding how it&#39;s possible for imperfect, sinful people to enter Heaven? The&nbsp;Bible says that only the righteous may enter Heaven, and though we may try&nbsp;our best to live right, no one can be perfect. So how can God let us into Heaven?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Answering this question is essentially the point Paul makes in&nbsp;Romans chapters 1-5.&nbsp; </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The details are given below, but the answer is simple.&nbsp;Christians (like unbelievers)&nbsp;sin from time to time, but unlike unbelievers, Christians have a promise that one day we will receive new bodies that will never sin again. God will do away with our old bodies before granting us the new body. You can learn more about this process in Lessons 15A-15E from our <a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\">1Corinthians study</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">How can God grant us this mercy while still being perfect in justice? How does He put away our sin forever without condemning us for it? The answer is&nbsp;the Lord made a way for sinners to meet the standard of perfection required by Heaven.&nbsp;God&#39;s Son, Jesus Christ, was born as a man so He could live&nbsp;the sinless life we couldn&#39;t, and He did so on our behalf. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Then He died an underserved death on the cross to pay&nbsp;the required price (i.e., a ransom)&nbsp;for our sins (past, present and future). Therefore, by faith in Christ we will be credited with His righteous, perfect life,&nbsp;and His death on the cross will become an acceptable payment to the Father as the&nbsp;penalty for our sins.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, we are not saved by our good works or by our own righteousness.&nbsp;Rather, we are saved by Christ&rsquo;s righteousness.&nbsp;Since we receive&nbsp;the righteousness of Christ through faith, our salvation does not depend on what we do, but on what Christ did for us.&nbsp;We will sin from time to time&nbsp;as we await our new, incorruptible body, yet all that sin has already been forgiven. This is the only way God has provided for&nbsp;sinful&nbsp;men and women to enter Heaven: by accepting Christ&#39;s righteousness in place of our own.</span></p>\n\n<p>The details of this explanation can be found in Romans. In Romans 1-3, Paul explains that all people are born as sinners, and we do not seek God&nbsp;nor acknowledge Him as God because our sinful state has blinded us to the truth.&nbsp;Paul says all have turned away, there is none righteous, no not one.&nbsp;The end result is that men and women&nbsp;deserve punishment in Hell.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Then beginning in chapter 4, Paul tells us how a person can be saved&nbsp;despite the fact that we are all sinners who deserve to be punished eternally in hell.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Using Abraham as the example, Paul explains that, like Abraham, we are saved by faith and not by works:</span></p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found? 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 3 For what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.&rdquo; 4 Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. 5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness, 6 just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:&nbsp; 7 &ldquo;Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, And whose sins have been covered. 8 &ldquo;Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This is why we call the message of salvation&nbsp;&ldquo;the gospel,\"&nbsp;which means good news in Greek. It is good news to learn that God will save us by faith alone in Jesus Christ rather than requiring that we are righteous on our own. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">When&nbsp;we believe in Him, God does two things.&nbsp;First, our sins are placed on Jesus, and on the cross He took the punishment we deserved; thus, God is still a just God in that He punished our sins.&nbsp;Second, by faith God counts us righteous, just as He did for Abraham.&nbsp;There is a great exchange:&nbsp; Jesus took the punishment we deserved on the cross, and at the same time, He credits us with His righteousness that He has from being without sin.</span></p>\n\n<p>To make sure we understand this, Paul continues the explanation of the gospel in Romans 5.&nbsp; Speaking about our being saved from punishment, he says:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. 10 For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">How are we &ldquo;saved by His life?&rdquo; God not only requires our sins to be punished, but we must also be perfect.&nbsp;Since we cannot be perfect, we need the righteousness of the only One who is perfect, and that is Jesus.&nbsp;Again, His righteousness is credited to us by faith.</span></p>\n\n<p>Romans 5:18-19 makes this clear:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;18 So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. 19 For as through the one man&rsquo;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nHere, Paul contrasts Adam with Jesus.&nbsp;In Adam, we are all born sinners because of Adam&rsquo;s sin.&nbsp;Adam&rsquo;s sin was credited to all humanity such that we are all born sinners.&nbsp;In Christ, believers are counted righteous because of Christ&rsquo;s obedience.&nbsp; This is why we must be &ldquo;born again.\"&nbsp;born not of the flesh, but of the Spirit.&nbsp;Because of Christ&rsquo;s perfect, sinless life, His righteousness is credited to us, and as such, we are also counted righteous.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious question at this point is that if I am saved by faith and not by what I do, and Christ has paid for my sins and given me His righteousness, then doesn&rsquo;t that mean I can sin all I want?&nbsp; Anticipating this question, Paul asks it in Romans 6:</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;1 What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase? 2 May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in it? 3 Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? 4 Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. 5 For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection, 6 knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin; 7 for he who has died is freed from sin.&rdquo;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Having been born again, we now have the power of the Holy Spirit to sin no more.&nbsp; Therefore, we are no longer slaves to sin and are called to walk in newness of life.&nbsp; So, it&rsquo;s not okay for us to continue willfully sinning, with the thought that &ldquo;hey, our sins are forgiven.&rdquo;&nbsp; </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">While salvation is a one time, eternal act at which point we are justified at the time we come to have faith in Christ, sanctification occurs over the rest of our life.&nbsp;Clearly, believers still sin.&nbsp;However, the goal is for us to become more and more like Christ.&nbsp;This happens over time, and the primary way God does this is through the study of His word.&nbsp; </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In His prayer to the Father, Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.&rdquo; (John 17:17)&nbsp; God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit transforms us as we study Scripture. Nevertheless, h</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">ow is it we still sin after being counted righteous and being indwelt by the Holy Spirit? </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Paul anticipates this question as well, which he answers in Romans 7:&nbsp; </span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;14 For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin. 15 For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate. 16 But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with the Law, confessing that the Law is good. 17 So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me. 18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. 19 For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. 20 But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">21 I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good. 22 For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man, 23 but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members. 24 Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.&rdquo;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>As believers, although we have been&nbsp;spiritually&nbsp;born again, we still have the remains of our sinful nature in our flesh.&nbsp;While our desire is to please God by being obedient, our flesh still desires to sin.&nbsp;Although we have the power of the Holy Spirit to overcome this sin, we don&rsquo;t always do this.&nbsp;Often, our flesh overcomes our desire to please God, and we still sin.</p>\n\n<p>But here again is the good news, the Gospel:&nbsp;Jesus sets us free from this body of sin and death!&nbsp; We are wretched, He is perfect.&nbsp;As long as we live here on earth, we will continue to struggle with sin.&nbsp; We will never be perfect this side of heaven.&nbsp;Again, though, the good news is that our salvation is not dependent upon whether we still sometimes sin, because Jesus lived the perfect life, and His perfect obedience is credited to us as believers.&nbsp;That is why the gospel is good news!</p>\n\n<p>Another very important point is that Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross paid for&nbsp;all&nbsp;of our sins:&nbsp; past, present and future.&nbsp; Hebrews 10 makes this clear:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;11 Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; 12 but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that time onward until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet. 14 For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. 15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">16 &ldquo;This is the covenant that I will make with them.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">After those days, says the Lord:&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I will put My laws upon their heart,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And on their mind I will write them,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">He then says,</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">17 &ldquo;And their sins and their lawless deeds&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I will remember no more.&rdquo;&rdquo;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Jesus&rsquo; one sacrifice on the cross was a one time offering&nbsp;for all time.&nbsp;By this&nbsp;one&nbsp;offering, Jesus has perfected all believers.&nbsp;Because of this, God says He will remember our sins no more.&nbsp; Notice, it does not say God will forget our sins.&nbsp; Rather, because of what Christ has done for us, God consciously no longer remembers our sin.&nbsp;This is a most comforting thought!&nbsp;For even though we still sin, because of our faith in Christ, God will not remember our sins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is how we can still sin as believers yet still go to heaven.&nbsp;The punishment for our sins, our perfect righteousness, it is all found in the person of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;Again, this is good news, indeed.</p>"

I would love to be married, if it is God&#39;s will for my life, but at this late stage of my life, I could probably only marry a divorcee or widower. Is this OK?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. In short, you are free to marry a man who has never been married before or a widower. We have a <a href=\"/resource_library/questions_and_answers/can_a_believer_get_remarried_after_divorce/\">lengthy article</a> concerning the Biblical view of marriage (and remarriage), which can answer this question in more detail. Meanwhile, while we&nbsp;hope the Lord leads you into marriage given your desire, you can also take encouragement in Paul&#39;s words from our&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\">1Corinthians</a>&nbsp;study:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 7:32 But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;<br />\n1Cor. 7:33 but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife,<br />\n1Cor. 7:34 and his interests are divided. The woman who is unmarried, and the virgin, is concerned about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but one who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.<br />\n1Cor. 7:35 This I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>If God has gifted you with a life of singleness, then you are privileged to serve Him without distractions. Though you may desire companionship (and this is understandable), singleness is held in high esteem in scripture as a special position for serving your \"husband,\" the Lord. Paul says this is not a restraint, meaning we are free to choose marriage if we wish, but he advocates for the benefits of singleness in ministry.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, singleness must be gifted to you by the Lord, or else you are at risk of \"burning with passion,\" Paul says, leading to the potention for lust and sin. Paul says it is better to marry than to risk sexual temptation and sin. Therefore, unless you have been gifted to live a single life, you should seek to marry one day.</p>\n\n<p>As you pray for the Lord to send you a husband, we recommend you also pray for wisdom as to whether the Lord has selected you for singleness so that you might serve Him in unique and powerful ways unburdened by the need to care for a husband. Your faithfulness to such a call would bring great joy and eternal blessing, should you determine this is the Lord&#39;s will.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

As I count the days, there are only two days between His death and resurrection...am I wrong?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The traditional teaching within the church is that Jesus was crucified on a Friday, and churches commonly observe the Friday before Easter Sunday as the day of Jesus&#39; death, but this observance is a matter of church tradition and not a Biblically accurate portrayal of Jesus&#39; death.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Scripture says clearly that Jesus would spend three days&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;three nights in the grave:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 12:40 for just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Scripture never names the specific day of the week on which Jesus dies, however we do know the day Jesus raised from the dead. Scripture says&nbsp;Jesus was raised before sunrise on the first day of the week:</p>\n\n<h6>Luke 24:1 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.<br />\nLuke 24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,<br />\nLuke 24:3 but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>The first day of the week in the Jewish calendar is Sunday, as it is in our culture today. So if Jesus was in the grave three days and three nights and rose before dawn on Sunday, then there is simply not enough time available for Jesus to have died on a Friday and raised on a Sunday.&nbsp;In reality, Jesus was not crucified on a Friday, but rather He was crucified on a Thursday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This conclusion is supported by Jesus&#39;s own comments in Matthew 12:40.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, a Thursday death is confirmed by the Jewish festival calendar <a href=\"/bible-answers/what-date-did-jesus-die\">in the year Jesus died</a>. In that year, the day of Passover began Wednesday night and ended Thursday at sundown. Therefore, the&nbsp;seven-day&nbsp;feast of Unleavened Bread began the next day on a Friday. The&nbsp;first day of this feast is always a Sabbath day according to scripture (Lev 26:6-8).</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, Jesus was buried on a Thursday, which was a preparation day prior to the start of a Friday Sabbath to celebrate the start of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Following the Friday Sabbath came the normal, weekly&nbsp;Sabbath observance on Saturday. So in the week Jesus died, two back-to-back Sabbath days were observed (i.e., Friday and Saturday). &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>The weekly Sabbath day ended at sundown on Saturday night. Then before sunrise on Sunday morning, the women came to an empty tomb, which is why Scripture says Jesus resurrected before sunbreak on the first day of the week. So if we count from Thursday daytime&nbsp;to Saturday night, we find three days and three nights, just as scripture requires.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For an in-depth explanation of the timing of the events during the week of Jesus&#39; death, please listen to&nbsp;</span><a href=\"/resource_library/bible_studies/the_book_of_luke/luke_lesson_22a/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Lesson 22A</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;of our Luke study.&nbsp;</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>The Bible promises a seven-year period of Tribulation on earth, but the&nbsp;final judgment moment for unbelievers waits for another 1,000 years. So why does God bother with bringing Tribulation on earth? What does it accomplish?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe seven year Tribulation is an important period in God&#39;s plan for the earth. We learn of the seven year period of Tribulation and God&#39;s purposes in bringing it primarily from the Old Testament prophets, particularly&nbsp;Daniel:</p>\n\n<h6>Dan. 9:24 &nbsp;&ldquo;Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy place.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Dan. 9:25 &nbsp;&ldquo;So you are to know and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the&nbsp; Prince there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Dan. 9:26 &nbsp;&ldquo;Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have&nbsp; nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end will come with a flood; even to the end&nbsp; there will be war; desolations are determined.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Dan. 9:27 &nbsp;&ldquo;And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out on the one who&nbsp; makes desolate.&rdquo;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>In Daniel 9, we learn three important details regarding the coming time of Tribulation.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">First, we learn that this period of time last one \"week\" (or literally \"seven\" in Hebrew). By the context of the historical events described in Daniel 9, it becomes clear that Daniel means&nbsp;a</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;seven-year period</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;of time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Daniel says a&nbsp;total of seventy \"sevens\" (i.e., 490 years) have been decreed by God. Based on the timing of events Daniel provides in vs.25-26, we can see that 69&nbsp;of of the 70 sevens&nbsp;have already transpired, leaving just one seven year period remaining. That remaining seven year period is the period of Tribulation, which has yet to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Daniel tells us&nbsp;God designated this period of&nbsp;490 years&nbsp;for Daniel&#39;s \"people.\" In other words, this is a period for Israel. Israel refers to the nation descended from Abraham and bound to the Old Covenant. By these terms, the&nbsp;Church is not \"Daniel&#39;s people,\"&nbsp;so the Church is specifically excluded from the events of this 490 year period. This period&nbsp;began in 605 BC&nbsp;before the church was formed, and&nbsp;it was suspended when the Messiah was \"cut off.\" Therefore, the church has never experienced any part of the&nbsp;490-year period designated for Israel...<em>nor will it ever!</em></p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, we learn the purposes God has for Israel during this period. In v.24 Daniel says the 490 years&nbsp;were decreed for six reasons:</p>\n\n<p><em>1. To finish the transgression</em> - to bring Israel&#39;s disobedience to the Old Covenant to an end<br />\n<em>2. To make an end of sin</em> - to put&nbsp;an end to all sin in the people of Israel (i.e., to glorify Israel)<br />\n<em>3. To make atonement for iniquity</em> - to exact a price for Israel&#39;s sins under the terms of the Old Covenant<br />\n<em>4. To bring in everlasting righteousness</em> - to usher in the Milennial Kingdom on earth<br />\n5. <em>To seal up vision and prophecy</em> - to bring to an end all revelation by granting a full knowledge of God<br />\n6. <em>To anoint the most holy place</em> - to set up the Milennial Kingdom temple where Christ will reside</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Notice that all these purposes and outcomes are focused exclusively on preparing Israel to enter the Kingdom following Tribulation at Christ&#39;s Second Coming. This is further&nbsp;confirmation that this period of great distress on the Earth is focused entirely on Israel and not on the church. The extreme nature of the events during Tribulation impact&nbsp;the whole earth, but the intended target is Israel. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We find even more confirmation of this conclusion in Jeremiah&#39;s description of the Tribulation, when he labels it a&nbsp;\"time of Jacob&#39;s (i.e., Israel&#39;s) distress:\"</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Jer. 30:7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lsquo;Alas! for that day is great,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is none like it;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And it is the time of Jacob&rsquo;s distress,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he will be saved from it.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Tribulation is called&nbsp;a time of Israel&#39;s distress, and yet Jacob (i.e., the nation of Israel) will be saved from it. Therefore, the chief purpose of Tribulation is to bring Israel back to the Lord, as Ezekiel teaches:</p>\n\n<h6>Ezek. 20:36 &nbsp;&ldquo;As I&nbsp; entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you,&rdquo; declares the Lord GOD.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 20:37 &nbsp;&ldquo;I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek. 20:38 &nbsp;and I will purge from you the rebels and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they will not enter the&nbsp; land of Israel. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Lord promises to bring Israel through a time of judgment and inspection&nbsp;(i.e., passing under the rod) so that He may purge Israel&#39;s sin and rebellion thereby bringing them back into the bond of the covenant. The covenant mentioned in this verse is the Old Covenant delivered through Moses.</p>\n\n<p>By the terms of that covenant, Israel must experience 490 years of God&#39;s judgment for failing to keep the covenent terms. Tribulation is the final act of that judgment, and it will result in bringing Israel back to the Lord.

Since this period</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;is appointed for Israel,</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;the Church will be removed prior to the beginning of the final seven years of God&#39;s judgment.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;This is why Paul says the Lord will return to remove the church prior to the beginning of the Tribulation:</span></p>\n\n<h6>1Th. 1:10 &nbsp;and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nYou can read more about the nature and timing of the rapture of the Church in our Revelation study and&nbsp;by reading <a href=\"/bible-answers/how_do_we_know_there_will_be_a_rapture\">Explaining the Rapture</a>.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>I have been taught that the Rapture of the Church occurs in the middle of Tribulation before the wrath of God is poured out in the Bowl Judgments. Isn&#39;t Paul talking about the these judgments when he teaches in 1Thessalonians 5:9 that the believer is not appointed to \"wrath?\"</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe timing of the rapture (or ressurection) of the church&nbsp;is a hotly debated question, yet&nbsp;one that can be easily resolved from scripture. The source of our confusion is taking verses and words of the Bible&nbsp;out of context while ignoring the whole counsel of scripture.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure you have the proper&nbsp;context of scripture on the question of the rapture, we highly recommend you read our articles:&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-answers/how_do_we_know_there_will_be_a_rapture\">Explaining the Rapture</a>, <a href=\"/bible-answers/which-trumpet-announces-the-rapture\">Which Trumpet Announces the Rapture</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-answers/is_the_last_trumpet_blown_for_the_rapture\">Will the Rapture Occur on Rosh Hashanah</a>.&nbsp;We also recommend you listen to our entire <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation course</a>, which will provide the complete context and explanation for this question and many more issues associated with end times events.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;the wrath Paul is talking about in 1Thessalonians&nbsp;is not a specific reference to the Bowl Judgments. Rather, Paul is talking about the wrath of all Tribulation. In 1Thess 5 Paul is comforting the church that they did not miss the resurrection, as some false teachers had been claiming. Though the church was suffering great persecution at the hands of the Jews and Romans, nevertheless their experience was not the Tribulation as some feared.</p>\n\n<h6>Th. 5:9 &nbsp;For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Th. 5:10&nbsp; who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Th. 5:11 Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just as you also are doing.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Paul says that the Church is not appointed to experience God&#39;s wrath. He meant that the Church&nbsp;need not fear they had missed the resurrection and were therefore&nbsp;experiencing the Tribulation.&nbsp;Paul had taught the Church earlier that&nbsp;the Rapture must precede&nbsp;the Tribulation, yet other false teachers had convinced them that they were presently enduring the Tribulation. Therefore, the church was concerned that the arrival of Tribulation meant they had missed the resurrection.</p>\n\n<p>Paul responds by reassuring the Church that they are not appointed or desitined to wrath, meaning the wrath of Tribulation. Therefore, they could be comforted knowing that their resurrection was still to happen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The key to interpreting this passage properly is in understanding that the entire seven years of Tribulation is considered the \"wrath of God.\" The Bowl Judgment are just&nbsp;the final and greatest outpouring of wrath during those seven years, but the wrath of God is evident in <strong><em>all</em></strong> the judgments of Tribulation, as Revelation teaches us:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rev. 15:1 &nbsp;Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues, which are the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice, the Bowl Judgments are the called \"the last\" because they \"finish\" the wrath of God in Tribulation. They are not the entirety of God&#39;s wrath. They are the finishing of God&#39;s wrath. Similarly, we find even <span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">the first judgments of Tribulation, the Seal Judgments, called judgments of wrath in Revelation:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Rev. 6:17 &nbsp;for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>After the sixth Seal Judgment, the people of earth declare that the great day of \"wrath\" has come upon them. Clearly, God&#39;s wrath comes to earth long before the Bowl Judgments appear. The Bowl Judgments are just the final outpouring of His wrath.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, if Paul says the Church is not destined (or appointed) to experience wrath at all, then this means we&nbsp;cannot experience any of the judgments of Tribulation. That&#39;s why Paul teaches that&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">the coming of the Lord for the Church (i.e., the Rapture) rescues us from this coming wrath:</span></p>\n\n<h6>1Th. 1:10 &nbsp;and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nThis Is one of many places we find the scriptures teaching that the Church has nothing to fear regarding the Tribulation. It is not appointed for the Church, since it is appointed for entirely different reasons.

And wouldn&#39;t this mean the Rapture happens in the latter half of&nbsp;Tribulation?</span></strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In 1Cor 15 Paul is explaining the manner of our resurrection, sometimes called the \"rapture:\"</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:51 Behold, I tell you a&nbsp; mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be&nbsp; changed,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 15:52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Paul says the moment of our transformation into our new physical bodies will happen instantaneously at \"the last trumpet.\" Since Paul calls this trumpet the \"last\" trumpet, there must have been earlier trumpet sounds that preceded the last trumpet.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Elsewhere in Revelation 11 we read about the seventh (and final) trumpet of the seven Trumpet Judgments sounding during Tribulation:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rev. 11:15 &nbsp;Then the&nbsp; seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and&nbsp; He will reign forever and ever.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em; font-size: 13px;\">These two events are different events, which happen at different times, though both involve the use of a trumpet, and&nbsp;though both scenes involve the use of a trumpet, these are very different trumpets. In fact, there are numerous difference between the two moments.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The trumpet referenced in 1Corinthians 15 is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the trumpets traditionally&nbsp;blown during the Jewish feast of&nbsp;Rosh Hashanah (also called the Feast of Trumpets for that reason).&nbsp;The last trump refers to this feast and to the Jewish practice of blowing trumpets at this feast each year. During the ceremony, there is a series of short trumpet sounds concluding with one long trumpet blast called the \"tekiah gedolah,\"&nbsp;which means &ldquo;the great trumpet blast.&rdquo; This is what Paul meant by the last trump. &nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Paul is teaching&nbsp;that the trumpet blasts of Rosh Hashanah&nbsp;were a picture of &ndash;&nbsp;and will be fulfilled by &ndash;&nbsp;the Rapture of the Church. This trumpet blast is traditionally blown by a Jewish man standing in Israel in keeping with the feast&#39;s requirements.</span></p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the trumpets of the seven Trumpet Judgments are blown not by men on earth but&nbsp;by angels in Heaven during the latter half of Tribulation. These are not used as signals of the Rapture. Rather, they are signals to warn&nbsp;unbelievers of impending judgment. These judgments will be&nbsp;the final opportunities for unbelievers on Earth in Tribulation to be saved before the final wrath of God poured out on earth in the Bowl Judgments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the historical order of authorship for the New Testament letters precludes any interpretation that&nbsp;views the last trumpet mentioned&nbsp;in 1Corinthians to be the same as&nbsp;the&nbsp;seventh Trumpet Judgment described in&nbsp;Revelation. In Paul&#39;s first letter to Corinth, he taught that the resurrection of the Church occurs at \"the\" last trumpet. Paul&#39;s&nbsp;use of the article \"the\" in describing the trumpet indicates to us that Paul expected his audience to know and recognize what trumpet blast he was referencing.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So what trumpet was Paul describing when he said \"the\" trumpet? We know&nbsp;Paul could <strong><em>not</em></strong> have meant the Trumpet Judgments of Revelation, because&nbsp;the book of Revelation hadn&#39;t been written at that time. In fact, the knowledge that there would even be Trumpet Judgments in a future day&nbsp;was not available to anyone, including Paul,&nbsp;until John wrote the book of Revelation nearly&nbsp;40 years <em><strong>after</strong></em> Paul wrote his letter to Corinth. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, at&nbsp;the time Paul wrote 1Corinthians, the only trumpet blasts the Church could have considered when reading Paul&#39;s letter&nbsp;were the trumpets blown at the feast of Trumpets.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Therefore, we must conclude that&nbsp;Paul was speaking of the&nbsp;final trumpet blast of the Feast of Trumpets, not the seventh Trumpet Judgment of Revelation.

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. When you teach of a coming \"rapture,\" are you saying there is a \"third coming\" of Christ? And how do we know for certain that Christ will&nbsp;remove&nbsp;the Church from the Earth before&nbsp;the Tribulation?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. There&nbsp;is no Biblical teaching concerning a \"third coming\" of Christ. Our Lord has already come to earth once (during His Earthly ministry from approximately 4 BC - AD 30), and scripture calls for His eventual return to live on Earth again and reign as King for 1,000 years. Therefore, we speak of Christ&#39;s return as a second coming because it will be the second time Christ resides on the earth.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Bible also teaches of another kind of appearance of&nbsp;Jesus, one that is fundamentally different than either His first or His second comings to live on the Earth. This other appearance is a return as well, but only to \"the clouds\" (i.e., in the sky) to&nbsp;retrieve the Church saints and remove them from the Earth. Jesus revealed&nbsp;this unique&nbsp;return in John&#39;s Gospel:</p>\n\n<h5>John 14:1 &nbsp;&ldquo;Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me.<br />\nJohn 14:2 &nbsp;&ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.<br />\nJohn 14:3 &nbsp;&ldquo;If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>At the end of John 13, Jesus had announced He would leave the disciples soon, and Peter objected saying:</p>\n\n<h5>John 13:36 &nbsp;Simon Peter&nbsp; said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, where are You going?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo; Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; but&nbsp; you will follow later.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Jesus told Peter that the disciples would&nbsp;have an opportunity to \"follow\" Jesus later. Then in John 14, Jesus explains what He meant. Jesus&nbsp;described the place He was going as \"His Father&#39;s house.\" This is the Heavenly throne room, and this is the place Jesus went when He departed the Earth:</p>\n\n<h5>John 20:17 Jesus&nbsp; said to her, &ldquo;Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, &lsquo;I&nbsp; ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Then Jesus explains that in this place are many dwelling places, and He&nbsp;was departing the Earth to prepare a place&nbsp;for each believer. So Jesus promises every believer in the Church an opportunity to join Jesus in the Heavenly realm in a future day.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/The-Rapture_2(1).jpg\" style=\"opacity: 0.9; margin: 10px 20px; float: right; width: 300px; height: 225px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then Jesus said that His return to fulfill this promise will occur in the same manner as when&nbsp;He left the earth (i.e., passing through the clouds as described in Acts 1:9). Notice&nbsp;this particular&nbsp;return is strictly for the purpose of retrieving the believers on earth and then taking them back to Heaven. Specifically, Jesus says He will \"receive\" us to where He is so that where He is (i.e., in Heaven) so will we be also.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Such an appearance of Christ is very different that the nature of Jesus&#39; promised second coming to live and reign on earth. In fact, this appearance is&nbsp;not a \"coming\" at all, in the sense that&nbsp;Jesus never reaches the Earth&nbsp;or sets His feet upon the ground, according to Paul.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Instead, Jesus comes to the sky to retrieve the Church and then returns to the Father&nbsp;without making the Earth His dwelling place.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Th. 4:13 But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope.<br />\n1Th. 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.<br />\n1Th. 4:15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.<br />\n1Th. 4:16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.<br />\n1Th. 4:17 Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.<br />\n1Th. 4:18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.</span></h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In this passage, Paul writes to comfort the church concerning the fate of those believers&nbsp;who die before Christ&#39;s return for His Church. Paul assures the church that those who die (i.e., are \"asleep\") will not be left behind at the resurrection, but in fact they will rise first to meet Christ. After the dead rise, those saints who are still alive on Earth will be \"caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.\" Once again, notice that this rendezvous occurs above the surface of the Earth in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, we know Paul cannot be describing Jesus&#39;&nbsp;second coming, for Jesus remains \"in the air\" and only meets the resurrection saints after they have departed the Earth in new resurrected bodies. This important detail proves&nbsp;this moment is a unique event, altogether separate from Christ&#39;s Second Coming, and&nbsp;one that matches Jesus&#39; promise to believers&nbsp;in John 14.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Church has taken to calling this unique event the \"rapture,\" because the Latin Vulgate version of the Bible published in the early 5th Century used&nbsp;the Latin word&nbsp;<em>rapere</em>&nbsp;in 1Thessalonians 4:17 for the Greek word&nbsp;<em>harpazo</em>,&nbsp;which means&nbsp;\"caught up.\"&nbsp;The Bible uses the word \"resurrection\" to describe this moment&nbsp;in&nbsp;1Corinthians 15.</span></p>\n\n<p>Regarding the timing of this event in relationship to the Tribulation,&nbsp;we first must understand the <em>purpose</em> of Tribulation before we can establish the timing of the rapture. The Bible teaches repeatedly and clearly that the time of Tribulation is a time of judgment specifically intended for the Jewish nation.</p>\n\n<p>We teach extensively concerning this period of judgment in our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation</a>, <a href=\"/bible-studies/isaiah\">Isaiah</a>, <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_luke\">Luke</a> and <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_ruth\">Ruth</a> studies. The Bible teaches consistently that&nbsp;the seven-year period of Tribulation is intended by God to chasten Israel for Her sins under the Mosaic Covenant, but it will lead the nation as a whole to repent and turn to the Christ.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Ezek 20-33-38&nbsp;God promises to bring Israel back into her land for a period of judgment and redemption. In&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Dan 9:24,&nbsp;God lists seven reasons why Israel must experience the seven years of Tribulation. And in J</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">er 30:2-9 God promises an unprecedented period of distress coming for Israel called the time of \"Jacob&#39;s troubles\" but the nation will be saved in the end.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">You can read more about the purposes of Tribulation in our article <a href=\"/bible-answers/why-tribulation\">Why Tribulation</a>?</span></p>\n\n<p>So, the seven-year period of worldwide distress called Tribulation is a time of judgment specifically directed toward the nation of Israel for the purpose of bringing Israel back to God. Due to the unprecedented nature of this time of judgment, it impacts the entire world and brings distress to everyone living on Earth in those days. Nevertheless, it is a result of Israel&#39;s sin and is directed specifically against that nation.</p>\n\n<p>Because the purpose of Tribulation is for Israel (and not for the Church), Paul teaches that the Church will not be subjected to this time of distress when it arrives on Earth. We can find Paul&#39;s teaching on the rapture and it&#39;s relationship to Tribulation in several passages, beginning with 1Thessalonians 1:10:</p>\n\n<h5>1Th. 1:10 &nbsp;and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He&nbsp; raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul says the Lord&#39;s return from Heaven is timed to rescue the Church before the wrath to come. The wrath Paul mentions is the wrath of the entire seven years of Tribulation. For more background on why&nbsp;the entire seven years of Tribulation is considered to be God&#39;s wrath, please read our article&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-answers/does-the-rapture-occur-pre-wrath\">Does the Rapture Occur Pre-Wrath?</a>\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In another&nbsp;passage from 1Thessalonians, Paul wrote to assure the Church that the Lord reassures the Church that we are not to worry about the day of Tribulation overtaking us unaware, because the Lord has not destined us for His wrath. Paul specifically&nbsp;referencing&nbsp;the rapture&nbsp;in this passage, when he reminds the Church it will escape the terror of Tribulation:</p>\n\n<h6>1Th. 5:1 Now as to the times and the epochs, brethren, you have no need of anything to be written to you.<br />\n1Th. 5:2 For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night.<br />\n1Th. 5:3 While they are saying, &ldquo;Peace and safety!&rdquo; then destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will not escape.<br />\n1Th. 5:4 But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day would overtake you like a thief;<br />\n1Th. 5:5 for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness;<br />\n1Th. 5:6 so then let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert and sober.<br />\n1Th. 5:7 For those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and those who get drunk get drunk at night.<br />\n1Th. 5:8 But since we are of the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.<br />\n1Th. 5:9 For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,<br />\n1Th. 5:10 who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him.</h6>\n\n<p>Notice in v.9 Paul says the Church is not destined for wrath, which begs the question <em>who is </em>destined for the wrath of Tribulation? The answer came in the earlier verses, when Paul says that the unsuspecting world will be the intended target, which principally refers to unbelieving Israel. As mentioned above,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Tribulation is a time of judgment intended for the Jewish nation and the unbelieving world, but the Church will escape this time, because Christ collects the Church from the Earth and escorts His Bride away before the coming judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p>(By the way, you can also see a prophetic picture of the coming rapture in the story of Isaac and Rebecca as taught in&nbsp;Lesson 24A-D of our&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis</a>&nbsp;study. You can also see a picture of the rapture in the book of <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_ruth\">Ruth</a>, Lessons 3B &amp; 4B.)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Paul gives additional detail on the&nbsp;rapture in 1Corinthians 15:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 15:51 Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,<br />\n1Cor. 15:52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.<br />\n1Cor. 15:53 For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.</h5>\n\n<p>Paul&#39;s main point in 1Cor 15 is to demonstrate the truth of resurrection and the need for a new \"incorruptible\" body before men can enter into the heavenly realm. As he teaches on this point, Paul introduces a \"mystery,\" a hidden truth that God is now unveiling through Paul&#39;s writing.</p>\n\n<p>The mystery Paul revealed in this passage was that not every Christian will experience physical death (i.e., \"sleep\") before they receive their new, incorruptible body. Though most Christians will experience a physical death before the resurrection of the righteous, some Christians will still be living when the moment of resurrection takes place.</p>\n\n<p>Paul then says that in a moment (in Greek, the phrase literally means in \"an atom of time\"), the dead are raised into their new bodies and the living are \"changed.\" The Greek word is <em>allasso</em>,&nbsp;which means an exchange of one thing for another.</p>\n\n<p>Paul is teaching that at the moment of the resurrection for all saints, any believers who are still alive at that moment will instantly exchange their present body for a new body. The exchange for a new incorruptible form is necessary because we are immediately escorted into Heaven with the Lord.</p>\n\n<p>This is the same Rapture Paul described in 1Thess, and it is a moment the Church has expected and longed for since Paul wrote these words. The rapture (resurrection) of the Church occurs prior to the the Tribulation and is intended to remove the saints prior to the Lord returning His attention to the sins of Israel and Her disobedience under the Old Covenant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can learn much more about the rapture &ndash;&nbsp;including where this event falls in the timeline of end times events &ndash; and&nbsp;its relationship to Israel&nbsp;by listening to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation</a> study in its entirety. In particular, please listen to Lessons 4C through&nbsp;5E.</p>"

Isn&#39;t that wrong, since it means we&#39;re praying for the world to fall under judgment?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Bible makes clear we are to anticipate and look forward to the coming Kingdom and all that comes with it. First, consider Jesus&rsquo; model of prayer given to the church:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 6:9&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, then, in this way:&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our Father who is in heaven,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hallowed be Your name.</h6>\n\n<h6>Matt. 6:10&nbsp;&nbsp; Your kingdom come.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your will be done,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;On earth as it is in heaven.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Jesus told us to pray specifically for the Lord&#39;s Kingdom to come to earth.&nbsp;Also, the apostle John declared his own desires to see Christ return quickly when he prayed:</p>\n\n<h6>Rev. 22:20&nbsp; He who&nbsp;testifies to these things says, &ldquo;Yes,&nbsp;I am coming quickly.&rdquo; Amen.&nbsp;Come, Lord Jesus.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>In fact, all the epistle writers urged the church to anticipate the Lord&rsquo;s return and to be ready for it with eager hearts. Peter says:</p>\n\n<h6>2Pet. 3:11&nbsp; Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,&nbsp;<br />\n2Pet. 3:12&nbsp; looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which&nbsp; the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the&nbsp; elements will melt with intense heat! &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Notice, Peter says we are to look for and &ldquo;hasten&rdquo; the return of Christ, so to speak, even though that day also brings judgment. We have no reason to hesitate in praying for the Lord&rsquo;s return, for judgment will come for the world whenever that day arrives. There is nothing to be gained (by us or the world) by delaying the inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the judgment that comes upon the world is a part of God&rsquo;s sovereign plan, and no soul will be denied Heaven apart from God&rsquo;s will and purpose.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Why are the Jews called God&#39;s chosen people? Since all mankind descends from Adam (and later Noah), why do Jews get special designation&nbsp;among all other peoples, especially since they worshpped false gods and disobeyed God&#39;s word?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Bible declares that the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are God&#39;s chosen people, a possession for Himself called to be&nbsp;the \"wife\" of Jehovah. Nevertheless, as you say the&nbsp;Jewish people are not inherently better people than the rest of mankind,&nbsp;nor did Israel&nbsp;earn (much less deserve) their special status with God. In fact, God declared that Israel was a nation of&nbsp;<em>unremarkable&nbsp;</em>people:</p>\n\n<h6>Deut. 7:6 &nbsp;&ldquo;For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you to be&nbsp;a people for His&nbsp;own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the&nbsp; earth.&nbsp;<br />\nDeut. 7:7&nbsp; &ldquo;The LORD did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples,&nbsp;<br />\nDeut. 7:8 &nbsp;but because the LORD loved you and kept the&nbsp;oath which He swore to your forefathers,&nbsp;the LORD brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of&nbsp;slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Bible says the Lord selected Israel to be His chosen people despite their lowly and unremarkable status. It was the&nbsp;Lord Himself Who created the Jewish people by way of a promise He delivered to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The Lord promised to grant these men inumerable descendants, who would inherit a special place in God&#39;s Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>The Lord&#39;s decision to award Israel a special place in His plan was simply an act of grace, not one based on Israel&#39;s merit. In other words, Israel wasn&#39;t chosen because they were special; Israel is&nbsp;called special because God chose them.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible also says the nation has received great honor and significant advantages as a result of being chosen by God:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 3:1 &nbsp;Then what&nbsp;advantage has the Jew? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 3:2 &nbsp;Great in every respect. First of all, that&nbsp;they were entrusted with the&nbsp;oracles of God.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Rom. 9:4 who are&nbsp;Israelites,&nbsp;to whom belongs&nbsp;the adoption as sons, and&nbsp;the glory and&nbsp;the covenants and&nbsp;the giving of the Law and&nbsp; the temple service and&nbsp;the promises,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 9:5 whose are&nbsp;the fathers, and&nbsp; from whom is&nbsp;the Christ according to the flesh,&nbsp;who is over all,&nbsp;God&nbsp;blessed&nbsp;forever. Amen.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Among other advantages, Israel was&nbsp;given the word of God (to guard and deliver to the world), the&nbsp;covenants of promise, the Law and the tabernacle service. Most&nbsp;importantly, Israel was chosen to bring&nbsp;forth the promised Messiah. The Lord elected Israel for the privilege of receiving these blessings, and by His choosing, the Lord made Israel special and set them above all other nations on Earth.</p>\n\n<p>The Lord did this out of love for Israel and out of a desire to use Israel to glorify Himself and bless the entire&nbsp;world. As the Lord decalred to Abraham:</p>\n\n<h6>Gen. 12:3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And&nbsp;I will bless those who bless you,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the one who&nbsp;curses you I will&nbsp;curse.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Israel didn&#39;t deserve the Lord&#39;s mercy (and neither do we), but still the Lord chose to make Israel special according to His word. He did this despite their history of sin. As you mentioned, the people of Israel have been (and continue to be) disobedient to God and in violation of His word. Still, the Lord remains faithful to Israel, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h6>2Tim. 2:13&nbsp; If we are faithless,&nbsp;He remains faithful, for&nbsp;He cannot deny Himself.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches that the Lord responded to Israel&#39;s disobedience with a temporary judgment. The Lord set Israel aside for a time, while extending His grace to Gentiles in their place. Paul teaches in Romans 11 that this \"switch\" is only temporary in God&#39;s plan. Eventually, the Lord&#39;s attention will return to His chosen people, and in that future day He will extend His grace to the Jewish nation again. As Paul says in Romans 11, in a day to come day all Israel (i.e., those who are Israel on that future day)&nbsp;will be saved, because the&nbsp;gifts and calling of God are irrevocable:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 11:25&nbsp; For&nbsp;I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this&nbsp;mystery &mdash; so that you will not be&nbsp;wise in your own estimation &mdash; that a partial&nbsp; hardening has happened to Israel until the&nbsp;fullness of the Gentiles has come in;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 11:26&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 11:27&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">THIS IS&nbsp; MY COVENANT WITH THEM,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 11:28&nbsp; From the standpoint of the gospel they are&nbsp; enemies for your sake, but&nbsp;from the standpoint of God&rsquo;s choice they are beloved for&nbsp;the sake of the fathers;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 11:29 &nbsp;for the gifts and the&nbsp;calling of God&nbsp;are irrevocable.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>You can learn more about the importance of Israel in God&#39;s plan by listening to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans study</a> online.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>As a Christian it is wrong to swear upon the Bible in court?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThere are two passages in scripture that&nbsp;are relevant to this question for the New Testament believer.</p>\n\n<p>The first is found in Matthew 5:</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;33 &ldquo;Again, you have heard that the ancients were told, &lsquo;You shall not make false vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord.&rsquo; 34 But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, 35 or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 But let your statement be, &lsquo;Yes, yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No, no&rsquo;; anything beyond these is of evil.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>The second is in James 5:</p>\n\n<h6>&ldquo;12 But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so that you may not fall under judgment.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>James is clearly echoing Jesus&rsquo; words.&nbsp;The Bible teaches Christians should not take&nbsp;oaths. However,&nbsp;the context of these passages helps clarify for us under what circumstances oath-taking is&nbsp;wrong.</p>\n\n<p>In Matthew 23, Jesus pronounces eight &ldquo;woes&rdquo; on the scribes and Pharisees.&nbsp;Woes are effectively curses, condemnations to Hell.&nbsp;This is extremely serious, because Jesus, who is God, is telling the scribes and Pharisees they are condemned.&nbsp;Once God pronounces this, it is forever done.&nbsp;One particular woe has to do with oaths:</p>\n\n<h6><br />\n&ldquo;16 &ldquo;Woe to you, blind guides, who say, &lsquo;Whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.&rsquo; 17 You fools and blind men! Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold? 18 And, &lsquo;Whoever swears by the altar, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.&rsquo; 19 You blind men, which is more important, the offering, or the altar that sanctifies the offering? 20 Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears both by the altar and by everything on it. 21 And whoever swears by the temple, swears both by the temple and by Him who dwells within it. 22 And whoever swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The scribes and Pharisees</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;were making oaths they did not intend to keep while ignoring other oaths when it suited them.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For example, they may swear &ldquo;by the temple</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">,\" but they had no intention of honoring their oath, making an excuse that one only had to honor</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;an oath sworn</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;by the &ldquo;gold of the temple.\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>In other words, these hypocrites found a&nbsp;convenient excuse to lie or renege on a promise whenever they wished.&nbsp;For this, Jesus condemns them.&nbsp;He points out the gold of the temple is not more important than the temple that sanctifies the gold. Their excuses for breaking promises were based on contrived technicalities that didn&#39;t even make logical sense.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the context of these passages, we can understand why taking oaths voluntarily is a sin.&nbsp;A person taking a voluntary oath is attempting to convince someone else they&nbsp;are telling the truth.&nbsp;Phrases like&nbsp;&ldquo;I swear on a stack of Bibles&rdquo; or &ldquo;I swear to God&rdquo; are given as evidence someone is&nbsp;not lying, which is only necessary when the person is&nbsp;suspected of being untrustworthy.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, when a person volunteers to take an&nbsp;oath, they usual do so to compensate for lack of trustworthiness.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This is the context in which Jesus condemns oath-taking&nbsp;in Matthew 5.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Notice the first verse:&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;Again, you have heard that the ancients were told, &lsquo;You shall not make false vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord.&#39;&rdquo;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Jesus condemns hypocrisy and challenges the idea of oaths compensating for untrustworthiness. Jesus says&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">a righteous man should not </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">swear by anything, because his&nbsp;yes will be&nbsp;yes, and his no will be no. In other words,&nbsp;trustworthy&nbsp;individuals don&#39;t need to resort to taking oaths.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, a Christian should be trustworthy in everything he or she says and does, thereby making oaths unnecessary.&nbsp;Jesus says Christians are not to make voluntary vows to enhance our promises, for doing so suggests we are less than trustworthy under normal circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, the habit of making vows creates a temptation for legalism and hypocrisy, since we establish our promise under a&nbsp;technical constraint&nbsp;that we can manipulate to fit our desires&nbsp;(like a child who crosses his fingers while making a promise).</span></p>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches that our honesty and integrity must be of&nbsp;the most importance.&nbsp;When we say we are going to do something, we should honor our word.&nbsp;James stresses&nbsp;the importance of demonstrating&nbsp;our faith by our works (chapter 2), and living up to our word is a work&nbsp;of our faith. Taking oaths doesn&#39;t improve a Christian&#39;s witness; it just complicates it.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Christians are not to make <em>voluntary</em> oaths as a means of enhancing&nbsp;our trustworthiness.&nbsp;Instead, we display trustworthiness in everything we say and do, thus negating the need for oaths.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we may encounter situations&nbsp;in civil society when we are required to take an oath (e.g., in a court of law, entering the military, etc.). In these cases, the oath we take is not voluntary, which changes the situation significantly. Voluntary oaths are taken to enhance personal credibility, which Jesus says is a sinful crutch, but involuntary oaths serve an entirely different purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Involuntary oaths are required as a matter of law to notify a person taking an oath they are subject to perjury penalties. This oath is not a guarantee of trustworthiness; it merely establishes&nbsp;legal authority to hold a person accountable for dishonesty. So a Christian may freely take an oath when required by law since this is not a voluntary act intended to compensate for untrustworthiness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In fact, when a Christian agrees to take an official oath as required by law, he or she is&nbsp;displaying respect for authority and law, which is consistent with trustworthiness. Conversely, a refusal to take a required oath would suggest&nbsp;<em>less trustworthiness</em>, which is not the witness a Christian should seek.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the manner of taking an oath may be of concern to some Christians. For example, the tradition in many courts is to use a Bible in the oath-taking process, but in light of Jesus&#39; words in Matthew 5, some Christians may object to this practice. Under these circumstances, courts allow a person to swear an oath without the use of a Bible. In all cases, let your conscience be your guide, doing your best to balance your witness and your desire to obey the law.&nbsp;</p>"

How should a Christian approach pornography?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A: Many people find themselves caught up in various kinds of sexual sin. However, we are all commanded to repent and flee from all sexual immorality.</p>\n\n<h5>1 Cor. 6:18-20 &ndash; &ldquo;Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.\"<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>God warns heavily against sexual sin throughout scripture and we see the consequences of this sin in many stories including Lot and his two daughters, Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham and Hagar, fallen angels sleeping with women in Gen. 6, and many more. There were and are severe consequences for sexual sin.</p>\n\n<p>We learn throughout the Bible that we all have sinned and our sin separates us from God.</p>\n\n<h5>Romans 3:23 &ndash; &ldquo;For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>Isaiah 69:2 &ndash; &ldquo;But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>When we put our faith in Christ Jesus and become His follower, we die to sin and do not live captive to it any longer.</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 6:1- 4 &ldquo;What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? Or don&rsquo;t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>It is only through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection that our sins are washed away and we can be united with God. This is not by any work we can do.</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:8-9 &ndash; &ldquo;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith&mdash;and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God&mdash; not by works, so that no one can boast.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nWhile our salvation does not depend on how many times we sin or how many times we &ldquo;get it right&rdquo;, we are called to be obedient to what God commands and follow in the footsteps of our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like pornography has become an addiction in your life and is taking over your mind and body. Sexual sin is like cancer to the soul. While professional Biblical counseling may be the best treatment for this addiction, there&nbsp;are also some personal steps a Christian can take to help guard against temptation:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Remove yourself from situations and environments that have any involvement in pornography or where pornography is encouraged and/or available.</li>\n\t<li>Be selective on what shows and movies you watch. It is almost impossible to turn on the television and not see sexual images and messages. Choose shows that do not have this content in them. Kids in Mind is a great website that lists all the movies and what their sexual content and rating is.</li>\n\t<li>Remove all access to pornography on your computer and smartphone. Get rid of everything that has to do with pornography&hellip;don&rsquo;t leave any of it. Empty and delete your search history and any bookmarks you may have. Download Internet browsers that filter this content out. There are many difference kinds. Make sure pornography is not accessible to you on any electronic device, especially when you&rsquo;re alone.</li>\n\t<li>Have a friend hold you accountable. They can keep an Internet search password to your computer and other electronic devices. You can also set up a system such as Covenant Eyes that emails a selected friend your Internet searches. Find a trusted friend and system that works for you both.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We cannot emphasize enough the severity of this sin and the consequences it has in your everyday life, relationships, and more importantly, your walk with the Lord. Please seek professional counseling and take steps to guard your heart, mind and body from pornography and all other sexual sin.</p>\n\n<p>You can learn more about what the Bible says regarding pornography by reading&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/why_is_watching_pornography_sinful/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why is Watching Pornography Sinful?</em></a></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Is it allowable for a born-again Christian to participate in martial arts?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The short answer is yes, a Christian may participate in martial arts, though the issue you raise is broader than just the topic of martial arts.</p>\n\n<p>The Christian is free under the Law of Christ to pursue many things so long as those pursuits are loving toward God and our neighbors, including the principle that we are not a stumbling block to our brothers and sisters (i.e., a cause for sin to other believers).</p>\n\n<p>By the same token, we could also ask about other issues including:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; - Can I ride with a group of bikers on a Harley?<br />\n&nbsp; - Can I practice meditation?<br />\n&nbsp; -&nbsp;Can I visit a bar?</p>\n\n<p>Etc...</p>\n\n<p>Each of these actions could be the basis for sin, or they could be consistent with holy living. For example, riding a Harley could be an act of rebellion in the heart of a believer, or it could be a recreational activity with the potential to witness to unbelievers within that community.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Meditating could be practicing a form of demon worship, or it could be a quiet, prayerful time spent with the Lord through His Spirit.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Going to a bar could be a means to drunkenness, or it could be a convenient neighborhood meeting place for fellowship with another believer. And so on.</span></p>\n\n<p>The question we should ask when evaluating the appropriateness of these activities is: What does my participation in this activity mean to me and to others watching me? In other words, why are you doing it? Motives and witness are everything here.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of your specific issue, there is nothing automatically wrong with participating in martial arts as a sport, but before you decide to participate, ask yourself what your motivation or purpose is in practicing these arts? Is it for exercise or strength or health or self-defense? If so, then you likely have liberty to participate, since your reason for participating is not sinful.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, are you practicing martial arts because you have a strong interest in Eastern religion or philosophy? Are you attracted to violence against others and wish to act it out? If so, then martial arts should be avoided, as it is likely to impair your walk with Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Martial arts can be practiced as an Eastern religion, or it can be a valuable sport that helps you to learn one of the fruits of the spirit: self-control. Your motive for participating is the key to finding your answer.</p>\n\n<p>As with all things involving our freedom in Christ, even when we have the right attitude, we must also consider our witness to other believers. Practicing martial arts around a immature believer who is still struggling with past experiences with Eastern religion or teaching would be a poor choice - just as drinking alcohol in front of a recovering alcoholic would be unloving.</p>\n\n<p>Consider both your motives and your potential witness to other believers as you make your choices in these matters.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>I found a test&nbsp;online that claims to help me&nbsp;discover my spiritual gift. Do these tests work?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Bible teaches that all Christians are gifted by the Spirit to serve the body of Christ. Our gifting is given to us so we may meet the&nbsp;spiritual needs of others in the church. Many Christians live in ignorance of their own&nbsp;spiritual gifting, while others discover their gift late in life and express frustration&nbsp;their gifting wasn&#39;t clear&nbsp;from the beginning. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As a result, some ministries have devised spiritual gift assessment&nbsp;tests to pinpoint a Christian&#39;s spiritual gift, but we feel these tests are unhelpful and even misleading. They try to measure something that can&#39;t be measured until after the believer has pursued&nbsp;a process of discovery and development through service to the body.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>To fully explain what we mean, let&#39;s consider&nbsp;a&nbsp;comparison between spiritual gifts and natural talents or abilities.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Every child is born with certain natural&nbsp;abilities, but during the early years of a child&#39;s life, these abilities are latent (i.e.,&nbsp;undiscovered). One child may be born with a gift for athletics while another has a talent for music, but though these talents are present from&nbsp;birth, each child must work to discover and develop his/her talent before it will be evident and useful.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For example, the athletically-gifted&nbsp;child must try&nbsp;various sports before discovering his/her natural talent. Though&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Michael Jordan was born&nbsp;a gifted athlete, still he still required years practicing and&nbsp;training before he became the best basketball player.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Likewise, the musical child must be exposed to various musical instruments and genres&nbsp;before knowing his/her passion and strength. Though&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">YoYo Ma was born with a rare musical talent, still he had to invest many years to master&nbsp;the cello&nbsp;before he&nbsp;achieved recognition&nbsp;as a gifted musician.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In other words, n</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">atural talents don&#39;t just \"appear;\"&nbsp;they must be discovered, developed and mastered through hard work. Hard work won&#39;t substitute for&nbsp;gifting, but neither can a talent become&nbsp;useful without preparation.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the combination of natural gifting and years of&nbsp;hard work that produces greatness.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So&nbsp;it is with spiritual gifting as well. At the moment we come to faith, the Lord gifts us in supernatural ways, but we begin our Christian walk as \"babes in Christ.\" In our spiritually&nbsp;immature state, our gift remains latent and must be&nbsp;discovered and developed.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Even though the source of our gifting is supernatural (i.e., the Spirit working in us), nevertheless we must apply ourselves in union with the Spirit to develop our spiritual gift before it can become something useful.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Now consider, how helpful would it be to test&nbsp;3-year old children to determine their natural talent or gifting? Could any test be devised&nbsp;to&nbsp;detect&nbsp;a toddler&#39;s&nbsp;future as a basketball star or musical prodigy?&nbsp;Perhaps a test might offer some hopeful signs, but in most cases the toddler&#39;s immaturity&nbsp;would prevent the test from revealing any useful insight.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Even&nbsp;though the&nbsp;child possessed a talent, the talent couldn&#39;t be measured until it was first discovered and developed to the point that it was clearly evident. For the same reason, we believe&nbsp;tests for&nbsp;spiritual gifts usually (if not always) fail for&nbsp;similar reasons.&nbsp;It&#39;s a Catch 22: what hasn&#39;t yet become evident can&#39;t be measured, and what has already become&nbsp;evident does not need to be discovered.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Secondly, we believe these tests are&nbsp;inaccurate because their methodology is flawed.&nbsp;A spiritual gift test&nbsp;typically relies&nbsp;on a series of questions probing&nbsp;a person&#39;s interest and aptitude for&nbsp;various church functions or service skills&nbsp;(i.e., public speaking ability, counseling skills, empathy, service mindedness, etc.). As a person responds to each question, the test detects patterns and narrows the list of possible spiritual gifts. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This methodology presumes&nbsp;that a spiritual gifting will be reflected in the person&#39;s interests and abilities, but&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">spiritual giftings don&#39;t&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;correlate to natural desires or strengths. For example, Moses was called to speak to Pharaoh to free Israel, but Moses was <em>not</em> naturally talented in public speaking:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Ex. 4:10 &nbsp;Then Moses said to the LORD, &ldquo;Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Had Moses taken a spiritual gifting test, he surely wouldn&#39;t have registered high on exortation gifts, yet this was exactly the role God appointed for Moses to serve in Israel. Likewise, our spiritual gifting may not match our natural desires, talents or interests. The Lord often selects men and women who are not inclined to certain tasks, so that when they serve, the people recognize the gifting was from God. As Paul explains:</span></p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 1:26 &nbsp;For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 1:27 but God has chosen the foolish things of&nbsp; the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of&nbsp; the world to shame the things which are strong,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 1:28 &nbsp;and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may&nbsp; nullify the things that are,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 1:29 &nbsp;so that no man may boast before God.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In summary, our spiritual gifts arrives at salvation, but our&nbsp;gift won&#39;t be obvious until after we&#39;ve spent time to discover our gifting&nbsp;through trial and error, and to develop it through service to the body. Before that point, our gift is latent and unlikely to register on any test or skill inventory. Furthermore, any such assessment relies on measuring&nbsp;<em>natural</em> talents, which may not correlate to our spiritual gifting.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Instead of relying on these tests to discover your spirit gift, we recommend Christians identify their gift by a process of&nbsp;discovery and development through serving in the body of Christ. Just as&nbsp;Michael Jordan played multiple sports throughout his youth before he discovered his strength in basketball,&nbsp;Christians should volunteer&nbsp;in a variety of capacities, and along the way they will discover their&nbsp;gifting. </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Over time, as we mature in our understanding of what the Spirit is doing through us, we will strengthen our gift. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Remember</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">, we don&#39;t seek to&nbsp;find our gift so that we may serve. We seek to serve, so that we can find our gift.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. How do we know that the books of the Bible are the \"right\" books? How was the Bible&#39;s contents determined?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The early church father&#39;s determined which texts qualified as inspired scripture based on fairly simple and straightforward criteria. First, the author of a text was to be someone who had Apostolic authority. The position of apostle is one of a specific spiritual gifting of the Holy Spirit, which is no longer available to the church today. All New Testament canon was authored by apostles.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/bibleInfo003.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 200px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px 10px; float: left;\" />The gift of apostleship could only be given by the Lord Jesus, and it was bestowed upon two groups of men. First, the gift of apostleship was given to the 12 that followed Jesus during His lifetime (<em>Judas, an unbeliever,&nbsp;was not a true apostle</em>).</p>\n\n<p>This first group of apostles were men who followed Jesus and who participated in the baptism of John the Baptist. The circle of 11 became 12 with the selection of Mathias in Acts 1:19-26. In those verses we see the apostles mentioning the requirement that only men who had followed Jesus since John the Baptist were eligible to be one of the 12.</p>\n\n<p>The second group of apostles were men who were appointed by a personal encounter with the&nbsp;resurrected Christ.&nbsp;This second group included men like Paul (see 1Cor 9:1), Barnabas (Acts 14:14), James (1Cor 15:7 &amp; Gal 1:19) as well as others.</p>\n\n<p>Men couldn&#39;t simply claim the office of apostle; they had to demonstrate that the Lord had indeed granted them that office. All apostles validated their claims to apostleship through unique supernatural abilities to perform miracles, especially miracles that mirrored those that the Lord Jesus Himself performed.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the apostles are seen in Acts and in the Epistles raising men from the dead, performing miraculous healing, bestowing the Holy Spirit upon new believers, surviving bites from deadly snakes and other miraculous signs. These were not abilities common to all believers but were unique to apostles. The purpose in these unique supernatural abilities was to validate their office and authority in the early church. You can see this principle described in scripture in many places, including 2Cor 12:12 and Hebrews 2:3-4.</p>\n\n<p>Men who held the office of apostle were recognized as the authority within the early church, and the Church understood their authority under Christ couldn&#39;t be challenged nor questioned by men, since their authority came directly from the Lord. As an example, read how Paul refers to his Christ-given position within the church in 1Cor 4:18-20 and again in the salutations in Colossians and 1Timothy.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Paul&#39;s letter to the Corinthians, it&#39;s obvious that some in the Corinthian church had challenged Paul&#39;s authority and teaching, so Paul tells the church to let these rebels within the church prove their authority by demonstrating their power. If they are truly speaking with God&#39;s authority, let them show God&#39;s power as proof of their authority. Obviously, Paul knew these false teachers couldn&#39;t demonstrate apostolic power, so Paul&#39;s challenge would have silenced them.</p>\n\n<p>While the formal canon of scripture wasn&#39;t determined until centuries after Christ&#39;s death, the letters of the apostles were viewed as scripture from their inception by the early Church. In fact, one of the criterion used by the Church fathers in determining if a work should be included in the canon of scripture was whether it had been regarding as inspired from the earliest days of the Church. The fact that these works originatedf with an apostle was sufficient to regard them as inspired, since one of the purposes of the role of the apostle was to communicate God&#39;s word to the Church.</p>\n\n<p>So, when the final canon was assembled in AD 327, the council at that time merely acknowledged and confirmed what the Church had long before agreed were the inspired works of Scripture. The 27 books of the New Testament were all validated as authorized by apostles and embraced as inspired text by the early Church without dispute. (The 39 books of the Old Testament canon already existed as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible\" target=\"_blank\">Jewish Bible</a>, based on the Masoretic text, and therefore they were adopted unchanged into the Protestant canon.)</p>\n\n<p>We could draw an analogy to the way a&nbsp;committee might assemble today for the purpose of verifying which ancient records were the authentic founding documents of the United States of America. The committee would certainly confirm that the Declaration of Independence, Constitution and other well-known documents were authentic&nbsp;while rightly rejecting later documents like the Gettysburg Address &ndash; documents that&nbsp;may have historical value yet failed to meet the specific criteria guiding the committee&#39;s judgment. In a similar manner, only works that met the strict test&nbsp;of apostolic authorship were permitted into&nbsp;the canon.</p>\n\n<p>Glancing down the list of authors in the New Testament, all the authors are men universally accepted as apostles in the first-century church. (The works of Luke were dictated by Paul and the Gospel of Mark was a dictation of Peter.)&nbsp;Only the writer of Hebrews remains unknown to us. The early church knew the author and acknowledged him to be an apostle, though his name has been lost to history.&nbsp;Many suspect the author was either&nbsp;Paul or Barnabas, both apostles.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the books that compose the canon of scripture were not selected in an arbitrary nor capricious fashion. They were selected based on a simple but rigorous standard of authors with proven apostolic authority, each man proving his authority with apostolic&nbsp;powers validated by witnesses and with&nbsp;instructions found trustworthy based on internal consistency with other scripture.</p>\n\n<p>With the death of the last apostle (John), the canon was closed until the return of Christ Himself, since He alone bestows the apostolic authority required to author new scripture. This is why John ends Revelation in the way he does:</p>\n\n<h6 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Rev. 22:18 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book;<br />\nRev. 22:19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Those verses come at the very end of the Bible, and Christ included them in John&#39;s book as a warning to anyone who would desire to expand scripture beyond what God Himself provided. It isn&#39;t merely a warning concerning altering the words of Revelation alone, but it also reflects the fact that all Biblical revelation was meant to end with that book (the last book written chronologically).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the book of Hebrews tells us this:</p>\n\n<h6 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Heb. 1:1 God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,<br />\nHeb. 1:2 in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>While revelation came in a variety of ways in past ages, in the age that follows Christ&#39;s death and resurrection, His words and the words He imparted through His apostles are the final revelation to men. There will be no further form nor source of revelation. This is because God the Father has reserved the highest honor for His Son. He would dishonor His Son if He were to provide men with a competing source for knowledge of the Father, since His Son is the Word. The Son is to be the culmination of all revelation to men, according to scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, there are many false works wish to masquerade&nbsp;as inspired text, and since the test of apostleship is so clear and irrefutable, many schemes have been concocted to overcome this test. Some false books have tried to gain credibility by claiming apostolic authors or mystical origins.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the supposed \"gospel\" of Timothy was rejected from the canon because the church fathers could not validate that the true author was the one named and because the text itself presented ideas and concepts not in harmony with other inspired text. This book and others&nbsp;like it included teaching that contradicted&nbsp;with other works of scripture which DO pass the test of apostleship, and therefore they were found to be uninspired.</p>\n\n<p>Other works like Maccabees or the Book of Wisdom were written after the first century (i.e., after all apostles were gone) in attempt to extend the written tradition of Jewish wisdom and historical texts, but they violate the New Testament principle that teaches all post-resurrection revelation must flow by and through Christ Himself. These books lack such authority.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, some of these extrabiblical texts may have teaching value (just as this article has teaching value), but since they are not directly inspired by Christ through His Spirit, we cannot hold them to be scripture&nbsp;and thus inerrant. All extra-Biblical sources must be interpreted through the lens of inspired scripture, and when they contradict inspired works, they must be dismissed in favor of scripture.</p>\n\n<p>You may be interested in reading another article on <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/is_the_apocrypha_inspired_scripture/\">why the Apocrypha is not considered inspired scripture</a>.</p>"

If a man falls into a serious sin of the kind Paul lists, then he cannot be said to be beyond reproach. Likewise,&nbsp;if he commits adultery, then is not a \"one woman man.\" Therefore, he&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">is&nbsp;forever&nbsp;barred from church leadership according to scripture.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">A pastor or elder&nbsp;who commits adultery or violates his marriage vows forfeits&nbsp;his opportunity to lead in the church, because he fails the&nbsp;character tests Paul gave to the church. These test were given to ensure the church had proper role models in leadership positions, whom the body of Christ&nbsp;could emulate. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Equally important, these character tests ensure the body is&nbsp;protected from the hypocrisy and missteps of men of weak character. Even if a pastor were to repent of his mistakes, his past sin would still limit his ability to serve as a role model to others, therefore&nbsp;he is barred from leadership to avoid confusing&nbsp;believers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Notice in 1Tim 3:4-5 Paul says that when a man has shown evidence he cannot manage the affairs of his own household well (i.e., a simple&nbsp;task), then he is also demonstrating he is unqualified to manage the household of God (i.e., a more difficult task).&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Finally, disqualification from leadership doesn&#39;t mean disqualification from participation in the body of Christ. &#8203;A fallen pastor&nbsp;may still be forgiven by his brothers and sisters and restored to fellowship in the church body provided he repents of his sin. From that point, he&nbsp;can play an important and useful role in the body of Christ serving in a variety of capacities as a member of the congregation. Nevertheless, his repentance does not erase his past moral failings, and according to Paul he has&nbsp;rendered&nbsp;himself&nbsp;ineligible to hold future&nbsp;leadership positions.</span></p>\n\n<p>Remember, leadership in the church is not a right; it is a privilege. Holding&nbsp;a position of&nbsp;leadership&nbsp;is contingent on a meeting strict tests of character, because we want&nbsp;every leader in the church to stand as an example to the church body&nbsp;of lifelong godliness and character. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

For a more complete explanation, we recommend you listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation</a> study online, especially Lesson 5E.</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, we caution against relying too much on contemporary Christian music for your Christian theology. Your example is consistent&nbsp;with&nbsp;our experience that&nbsp;many contemporary Christian&nbsp;musical artists may be gifted in song but are not&nbsp;qualified teachers. Even when a song&#39;s lyrics are consistent with sound biblical theology, lyrics are never adequate to express the depths of God&#39;s word with clarity and nuance, so we must look beyond the typical 4-minute Christian radio hit song&nbsp;for our biblical discipleship<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>I know the lyrics of contemporary Christian music can be very edifying, but what about the style of the music itself? The rock beat seems to appeal to the flesh. Is this type of music drawing people closer to God, especially the young people?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nWhile it is true that the enemy will use music (or anything else) to introduce lies and distract believers from the truth, we must be careful when identifying any potential source of harm.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/photo-copyb.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 391px; margin: 5px 10px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Music lyrics can be evaluated objectively by their content. We can discern whether the message they convey is edifying, wholesome and consistent with scripture, or if the message is destructive, unwholesome and unbiblical. On the other hand, musical style is very hard (if not impossible) to judge morally. Different cultures appreciate different styles of music, and yet all styles can be used in a potentially edifying manner and also in a potentially destructive manner.</span></p>\n\n<p>Chanting can be used in glorious hymns to Christ or in senseless pagan mantras. Symphonic music can become edifying requiems or empty testimonies to man&rsquo;s vainglory. Rock and country music can introduce the masses to the gospel or feed the flesh of unbelievers.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, a person (even a Christian) may use rock music to feed the flesh rather than to edify the spirit, but lovers of symphonies or jazz or even tradition hymns are capable of doing the same. Many an unbeliever has attended churches in past centuries merely for the opportunity to hear beautiful choral music, which is no different than teenagers feeding their flesh today with rock music in contemporary church services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In the end, we must guard against equating our own musical preferences with holiness while adopting a judgmental attitude toward others&rsquo; musical preferences. Every style of music can be redeemed for the Lord or abused by the flesh. It&rsquo;s not the music that matters, but the nature of our hearts.</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, if a Christian&#39;s worship or discipleship&nbsp;experience is limited to the theology gained from contemporary Christian music, then certainly the believer is not likely to grow properly. Musical worship is not capable of drawing us into a proper, abiding relationship with Christ, though it can supplement our learning and inspire us to grow closer to the Lord. A healthy relationship depends on regular, indepth Bible study, prayer, fellowship and accountability, and worship in a meaningful way. Contermpaorary Christian music can be a useful part of this \"formula,\" but by itself it will do little to mature us.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Are tattoos permitted for a Christian? There are two verses&nbsp;that everyone quotes to&nbsp;say tattoos are wrong (i.e., Leviticus 19:28 &amp; 1Cor 6:19). What do you say?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Simply put, there is no specific restriction in scripture against a Christian getting a tattoo.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the verses you cited, the passage from Leviticus is found in the Law of the Old Covenant, and therefore it is not binding on a Christian under the New Covenant. Christians are not under the Law (see Rom 6:14; Gal 4:4-5; 5:18).</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/RELIGIOUS-CHRISTIAN-JESUS-feet-toes--TATTOOS-flash-designs-TATTOO-pictures-gallery-TATTOO-art2.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 225px; margin: 5px 9px; float: left;\" />To those who believe that Christians should avoid tattoos because of Lev 19:28, you might ask them are they prepared to observe the verse immediately prior in Lev 19:27: &ldquo;You shall not round off the side-growth of your heads nor harm the edges of your beard.&rdquo; If not, then why do they require a Christian to keep one part of the Law but not keep all of it? This is an example of the self-contradictory legalism that weakens the Church and confuses the faithful. As James says in 2:10, either we keep the entire Law or we have become guilty of violating all of it.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the teaching in 1Cor 6 addresses avoiding immorality committed with the body. Specifcally, Paul was talking about prostitution, and his comment in 1Cor 6:19 instructs the Corinthian church to abstain from participating in immoral practices involving idol worship and debauchery of various kinds.</p>\n\n<p>Does Paul&#39;s general statement that we should glorify God with our bodies automatically make tattoos wrong? We would argue no it doesn&#39;t. For example, a tattoo could be designed to glorify God by displaying the phrase, \"Jesus is Lord\" or perhaps a scripture verse, etc. In that sense, a tattoo becomes just another way to adorn the body, like earrings or makeup. Can we really claim that Scripture teaches is it less godly for a Christian to place a butterfly&nbsp;tattoo on her ankle than to pierce an ear or wear makeup or dye her hair?</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if the Christian chooses an inappropriate tattoo (e.g., crude language or unholy images), then the tatoo would be wrong in the same way that leud or revealing clothing is wrong. The bottom line is the intent and the message of our actions matter, but not necessarily the form.</p>\n\n<p>The mere existence of a tattoo isn&#39;t wrong by itself, and it doesn&#39;t violate specific scriptural mandates for the Christian. Nevertheless, the Christian should practice love toward God and his neighbor when deciding whether to obtain a tatoo and what design to select.</p>"

Many false religions teach that after a person dies, he will still have opportunity to go to heaven. Some teach this can be accomplished through reincarnation; that is, coming back as a different person over many lifetimes to \"make up\" for past wrongs.</p>\n\n<p>Some teach that the sin we have when we die must be punished or purged following death in a place called purgatory. After sufficient purging, we may then merit entry into heaven.</p>\n\n<p>Some even teach there is no hell - only different levels of heaven that we will enjoy based on our merit.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that all of these teachings are based upon some form of human works: something man must do, or undergo in order to attain heaven. Works-based religions may appeal to our fleshly nature, but what does the Bible teach about life after death?</p>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches clearly that after death comes judgment; there is no \"second chance.\"</p>\n\n<p>For example, consider Hebrews 9:</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Heb. 9:24 For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;<br />\nHeb. 9:25 nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own.<br />\nHeb. 9:26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<br />\nHeb. 9:27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment,<br />\nHeb. 9:28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him.</em></p>\n\n<p>We should note verse 27 compares the death and judgment of men to Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice on the cross: just as Christ&#39;s death on the cross was a \"once for all time\" event, every man&#39;s death is a one-time event...and then comes judgment.</p>\n\n<p>The writer goes on to explain that Christ will appear a second time for salvation for the sake of Christians, and Jesus&#39; second appearance will also mean judgment for all unbelievers. At that time, all unbelievers will be resurrected, and Christ will judge unbelievers justly for their sins. Then He will cast all into the Lake of Fire, where they will face eternal punishment (Revelation 20:11-15).</p>\n\n<p>We can know for sure there is no second chance for an unbeliever, since scripture says that all unbelievers are brought before this judgment moment. Again, all are thrown into the lake of fire to experience what Scripture calls the \"second death.\" (See also Luke 16:19-31.)</p>\n\n<p>Those who trust in Jesus Christ will never experience the second death. Instead, we eagerly await the coming of Christ knowing our faith has saved us from this outcome (Luke 7:50).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

Your thoughts?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Scripture teaches that Babylon is actually two entities intertwined in Chapters 17 and 18. The first Babylon is a literal, physical place during the time of Tribulation from where the Antichrist rules. The second Babylon is the Harlot, a religious system the Antichrist uses to control the world in the last days.</p>\n\n<p>Scripture distinguishes between&nbsp;two Babylons in the end times, the place and the religious system,&nbsp;which are two sides of the same coin.&nbsp;The Bible calls the&nbsp;religious system led by the False Prophet \"Babylon,\"&nbsp;while&nbsp;the world headquarters of the religion&#39;s False Prophet is&nbsp;located in the geographical&nbsp;Babylon, which is also the Antichrist&rsquo;s capital city.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/babylon.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 364px; float: right; margin: 5px 8px;\" />From a close study of scripture, we find&nbsp;no reason to reject a literal interpretation of a future world capital in the Babylon located at the site of the ancient city in present-day Iraq. Remember, if the plain sense of scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense (i.e., the &ldquo;Golden Rule&rdquo; of interpretation).</p>\n\n<p>The descriptions of this future Babylon &ndash;&nbsp;including its location east of Jerusalem provided in Revelation &ndash; all point to a location in Mesopotamia. Furthermore, there is no Biblical support for moving Babylon&rsquo;s location to another spot in the world. Therefore, since there is no reason to reject the literal place of Babylon in Iraq, then we should seek no other answer and accept the plain meaning of scripture.</p>\n\n<p>The second entity called Babylon (i.e., the religious Harlot in Revelation 17) may indeed have its origins, at least in part, within the present-day Catholic church. It could likely include many of the false practices and idol worship found within Catholicism today, however it would be too narrow an interpretation (in my opinion) to conclude that the future Babylon world religion is merely the Catholic church in its present form.</p>\n\n<p>Much will have to change in the world to make possible&nbsp;these events, so whatever false religion will dominate in that day will exist in a radically different world than the one we know now. Of course, the power and purpose of this false religion will remain unchanged since the time of the Garden of Eden and the Tower of Babel: to oppose God and pull men and women away from the truth. So, if the Babylon of Revelation is connected to Rome and the Catholic Church of today, it could only be in the same way that a mother is connected to her daughter: one gives birth to the other.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Is it wrong for a Christian to engage in sexual&nbsp;contact&nbsp;or intimacy before marriage, specifically with someone you plan to marry in the near future?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The Bible &nbsp;teaches that sexual intimacy before marriage is sinful behavior, and Christians are instructed in clear terms to avoid such sin. The Bible warns repeatedly that sex before marriage (i.e., fornication)&nbsp;is a violation of the marriage covenant. For example, the writer to Hebrews says:</p>\n\n<h6>Heb. 13:4 Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Greek word for fornication literally means sex outside of marriage, while&nbsp;adultery&nbsp;is&nbsp;sex with a married person other than the spouse. Both types of sexual relations are sinful.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Jesus also taught this truth:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 15:19 &ldquo; For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders.</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice Jesus list fornication in the same list as murder, theft and liars. Clearly, sex before marriage is a serious sin, according to our Lord.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, a Christian&#39;s dating behaviors must be in accordance with scripture at all times. We cannot court a person with the intent to seduce them into&nbsp;sexual behavior of any kind prior to marriage. Even lessor forms of intimacy like kissing or petting can be lustful preludes to fornication, tempting even the strongest&nbsp;Christians to seccumb to more serious sin. In short, a<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">ll sexual behavior must w</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">ait until marriage, and once married these behaviors must remain confined to the marriage bed, as Hebrews 13:4 makes clear</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>My child was also diagnosed with ADD and it is causing him frustration&nbsp;in school. I have committed myself to prayer first as a&nbsp;solution&nbsp;before I consider medication. Is medicating behavioral issues like ADD-appropriate?&nbsp;</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Before we address the question of a Christian taking psychotropic drugs, we must reiterate that our ministry&#39;s mission is to offer&nbsp;instruction on the Bible, so we are not qualified to provide medical advice nor do we advise&nbsp;anyone to act contrary to a doctor&#39;s instructions.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Now let&#39;s consider the role of modern medicine in the faith life of a Christian.&nbsp;Does the Bible forbid the use of medicines in general? If God doesn&#39;t choose to heal a person miraculously, is it wrong to seek medical aid? If a Christian sought&nbsp;such help be interfering with God&rsquo;s will?</span></p>\n\n<p>When we consult scripture, we find nowhere that God commands Christians to avoid&nbsp;doctors or medicine, nor to refuse blood transfusions, inoculations or surgery. In fact, we often see medical knowledge praised as a gift from God for the benefit of people.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in Genesis 17:10-14 the Lord commands the procedure of circumcision to Abraham. God ordained this minor surgery for a very specific, spiritual purpose, but nevertheless this example demonstrates that relying on a medical procedure isn&#39;t contrary to obeying God. In fact, sometimes it&#39;s necessary to obeying God.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we find physicians called Joseph&rsquo;s \"servants\" in Genesis 50:2, and the word for physicians is the same word used to described God as our \"healer\" in Exodus 15:26. Once again, the implication is that physicians are doing a good work for God&#39;s people as an extension of God&#39;s own healing ministry.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, in Proverbs 17:22 we read, \"A merry heart does good like a medicine.\" This verse presents medicine in a positive light as a metaphor for a happy heart. If our reliance on medicine was contrary to faith, then the word of God would never have used it as a metaphor for a glad heart.</p>\n\n<p>Then in Isaiah 38:21 we find the prophet prescribing a poultice (i.e., medicinal remedy) for Hezekiah&rsquo;s boil. While all healing is directed by God, we see the poultice clearly&nbsp;demonstrates that God uses medical procedures at times as a means of delivering the healing He provides. Here is strong evidence that we may be healed by God though the use of sound medical practice!</p>\n\n<p>In other examples, we find in Jeremiah 8:22 a statement that Gilead approves of physicians, albeit metaphorically. Then Jeremiah 30:13 equates the lack of medicine with a lack of healing, and Jeremiah 51:8 says&nbsp;medicine is the way for Babylon to be healed. Although these examples are spiritual metaphors, they only work as metaphor <em>because</em>&nbsp;they rest upon the fact of God&#39;s gracious provision of medical treatments available for our benefit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One final verse from the Old Testament is especially telling. Ezekiel 47:12 says&nbsp;healing medicine will be made from the leaves of trees that are nourished by waters from the new temple in the&nbsp;New Jerusalem. Revelation 22:2 also describes the tree of healing in the New Jerusalem, suggesting that medicinal tools are an important part of God&#39;s purpose.</p>\n\n<p>We are not suggesting that healing is accomplished through medicine alone (nor&nbsp;that our resurrected bodies will suffer from physical ailments), but rather that God supports the life of&nbsp;our bodies in a variety of physical ways, including through food, water and at times medicine.&nbsp;If you are interested in learning more about why a healing tree exists in the New Jerusalem, please listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation study</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Looking to&nbsp;the New Testament Jesus Christ said, \"Those who are well do not need a physician, but those who are sick\" (Luke 5:31). Again, in Luke 4:23 Jesus quotes&nbsp;the proverb, \"Physician, heal yourself,\" and applied it to Himself. In no case do we find Christ disapproving&nbsp;of medicines or physicians. In fact, one of the Gospel writers, Luke, was a \"beloved physician\"&nbsp;himself (<em>see Col 4:!4</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, every Christian should understand that all healing comes from God, so we can seek medical treatment knowing that the Lord often uses medicine to accomplish His healing. As Jeremiah 17:5 states, \"Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh&nbsp;his strength, whose heart departs from the Lord.\"</p>\n\n<h5><br />\nTreating Emotional and Behavioral Conditions with Drugs<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So how should a Christian treat emotional or behavioral conditions like depression or ADHD?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As we stated earlier, we are not qualified to offer medical advice. Only a licensed medical professional can dispense medical advice. We can only offer the biblical perspective of&nbsp;psychotropic drugs on the spiritual life of a believer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In every case, taking drugs to alter&nbsp;mood or mind is a serious step a Christian should not take without careful forethought and prayer.&nbsp;Psychotropic drugs are powerful, brain-altering chemicals, which doctors are increasingly prescribing to address emotional and behavioral problems &ndash; problems that may&nbsp;have a spiritual root cause&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;a physiological source.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, we are concerned that some Christians turn to these drugs on a doctor&#39;s recommendation before fully considering giving the consequence of their decision. We are concerned that society&#39;s&nbsp;increasing reliance on these drugs may be masking more serious, u<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">nderlying spiritual, behavioral&nbsp;or emotional&nbsp;problems.&nbsp;We are concerned that Christians who rely on psychotropic drugs to treat emotional or behavior issues may forfeit&nbsp;the spiritual benefit that comes by wrestling with a trial the Lord may have intended for our spiritual benefit.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Finally,&nbsp;we are concerned that Christians who live in a chemically-induced state of artificial contentment&nbsp;are only delaying the inevitable spiritual crisis that results when the drugs lose their effectiveness to&nbsp;stem the tide of emotional or spiritual pain.</span></p>\n\n<p>Our sin and the sin of others around are often the catalyst for creating the circumstances that lead to destructive behaviors, emotional pain, depression, anxiety and other ailments.&nbsp;The Lord&#39;s prescription for these situations is that we (or others) humble ourselves, repent of the sin, and commit to living in obedience according to His word. The trauma we experience in the meantime is the instrument of&nbsp;discipline the Lord uses with His&nbsp;children to bring us to that moment of repentance.</p>\n\n<p>In&nbsp;cases where a person will not repent or seek godly counsel, we should expect the Lord to allow&nbsp;the person&#39;s&nbsp;negative emotional state to continue, even to the point of developing into&nbsp;a chronic condition. When a parent fails&nbsp;to rely on biblical approach to parenting and discipline in raising children, the Lord may permit these errors to result in&nbsp;children with&nbsp;behavioral problems. If a Christian will not acknowledge the Lord&#39;s sovereignty and rest in His word, the person may live in constant anxiety or depression.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, these are just examples, but in general the Bible teaches that&nbsp;the Lord may allow a Christian&nbsp;to experience the consequence of his errors <em>so he&nbsp;will have cause to turn from his ways and seek the Lord in His word</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">n such cases, if the person turns to psychotropic drugs instead, he may mask&nbsp;the true, underlying spiritual cause for his issue. The patient experiences a behavioral or attitude \"improvement,\" but the change is artificial, a product of&nbsp;chemistry rather than true spiritual change. Like taking heroin or alcohol, the person \"feels\" better for as long as the drug is in the bloodstream, but the true cause for the problem remains untreated.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We believe the Christian who relies on these drugs to treat anxiety or depression&nbsp;will not grow spiritually from this trial, since they inoculate&nbsp;themselves against the therapuetic,&nbsp;corrective effects of the Spirit&#39;s conviction. They avoid the need to examine their life for sin and take corrective steps.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Similarly&nbsp;when parents administer these drugs to misbehaving children, they avoid contending with the&nbsp;underlying cause for the child&#39;s&nbsp;self-discipline or obedience issues. Remember, just because drugs have the power to compel change in a person&#39;s behavior doesn&#39;t mean a&nbsp;drug is a&nbsp;solution.</span></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if a Christian is suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD or any other psychiatric condition for which psychotropic drugs are commonly prescribed, we strongly recommend the Christian seeks sound, biblical counseling <em>before</em> turning to these drugs for a cure. Give thought to the possibility that these emotional or behavioral issues are the symptoms of a spiritual deficit, which must be addressed through repentance, godly counsel and a spiritual change in accordance with God&#39;s word.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, not all situations are the same, and in some cases a Christian may suffer from an emotional trauma or physical ailment best remedied through&nbsp;drug therapy.&nbsp;In severe cases, emotional stress may overwhelm an individual to the point that drugs are the only option to controlling behavior and avoiding a more serious, life-threatening situation. In these cases, drug therapy can be&nbsp;essential to stabilizing the individual&#39;s emotional state, so that counseling and other treatments&nbsp;may be successful.</p>\n\n<p>Even in these severe&nbsp;cases, however, we recommend the Christian seek the eventual elimination of drug therapy.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We believe that longterm dependance on psychotropic drugs by any believer is counterproductive to spiritual growth. If a person has the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, they already possess the most powerful Healer and Comforter.&nbsp;</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. How do I know my understanding of Scripture comes from the Holy Spirit and not my own interpretation?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Correctly understanding the truth of God&#39;s word is never a matter of personal opinion or private interpretation, as Peter says:</p>\n\n<h5>2Pet. 1:19&nbsp; So we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the&nbsp; day dawns and the morning star arises&nbsp; in your hearts.<br />\n2Pet. 1:20 But know this first of all, that&nbsp; no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one&rsquo;s own interpretation,<br />\n2Pet. 1:21 for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Peter reminds us that we have been given the word of God, which is a sure and reliable thing. God has the power not only to deliver His word to us but to also ensure we gain the proper understanding of it. In v.20 Peter says that the correct interpretation of scripture is never found in one&#39;s own opinion. In other words, we do not arrive at the truth of God&#39;s word through assumptions, opinions or \"feelings.\" No different than the way one arrives at a proper understanding of mathematics or biology, we must study scripture with an expectation that the truth is objective and absolute. It does not bend to the will of men.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, scripture also teaches us that our ability to uncover the correct interpretation of scripture is a God-given ability. Notice in v.21 Peter says that all scripture was authored as a result of the Holy Spirit moving a man to record the words of God. Therefore, since the word of God was authored by the Spirit, only the Spirit Himself can properly interpret its meaning. This is why Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of&nbsp; the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God,<br />\n1Cor. 2:13 which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.<br />\n1Cor. 2:14&nbsp; But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>All believers have been given the indwelling of the Holy Spirit so He can teach us the true meaning of scripture. In a sense, the Author of scripture explains its meaning to us as we endeavor to learn it. If men absent the Holy Spirit endeavor to learn its meaning, they will inevitably come away with a false, distorted view of scripture, since they lack the Spirit to guide them and reveal the truth.</p>\n\n<p>More over,&nbsp;believers will misinterpret scripture from time to time, but unlike unbelievers errors, these misunderstandings are merely the consequence of the normal process of moving from spiritual immaturity to the fullness of Christ:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 4:11 And He&nbsp; gave&nbsp; some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as&nbsp; evangelists, and some as pastors and&nbsp; teachers,<br />\nEph. 4:12&nbsp; for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of&nbsp; the body of Christ;<br />\nEph. 4:13 until we all attain to&nbsp; the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature&nbsp; which belongs to the&nbsp; fullness of Christ.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In other words, a healthy Christian committed to maturing in God&#39;s word will steadily increase in the correct knowledge of God&#39;s word. Whatever mistaken understanding we may acquire in the early years of our studies may eventually be corrected by the Spirit, so long as we persevere in our studies and maintain a teachable heart. People who become stubbornly unteachable will cease maturing and may be left with many false views of scripture, since they have stopped listening to the Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>The desire to have Jesus explain everything all at once is understandable and common, but it is also potentially harmful. The Lord expects us to devote ourselves to a lifelong study of His word, for this is the way we maintain a close, daily relationship with Him. Were He to explain everything in His word to us all at once (assuming we were even capable of absorbing it all), we would have no incentive to maintain a daily relationship through His word.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our spiritual goal isn&#39;t to understand the Bible; our spiritual goal is to know the Lord and grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ through a study of His word.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Does the Bible require women to wear their hair long?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A. The Apostle Paul addressed the question of hair length in his first letter to the church in Corinth, when he writes:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 11:2 Now I praise you because you&nbsp; remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you.<br />\n1Cor. 11:3 But I want you to understand that&nbsp; Christ is the&nbsp; head of every man, and&nbsp; the man is the head of a woman, and God is the&nbsp; head of&nbsp; Christ.<br />\n1Cor. 11:4 Every man who has something on his head while praying or&nbsp; prophesying disgraces his head.<br />\n1Cor. 11:5 But every&nbsp; woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head, for she is one and the same as the woman&nbsp; whose head is&nbsp; shaved.<br />\n1Cor. 11:6 For if a woman does not cover&nbsp; her head, let her also&nbsp; have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to&nbsp; have her hair cut off or&nbsp; her head shaved, let her cover her head.<br />\n1Cor. 11:7 For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the&nbsp; image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.<br />\n1Cor. 11:8 For&nbsp; man&nbsp; does not originate from woman, but woman from man;<br />\n1Cor. 11:9 for indeed man was not created for the woman&rsquo;s sake, but&nbsp; woman for the man&rsquo;s sake.<br />\n1Cor. 11:10 Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.<br />\n1Cor. 11:11 However, in the Lord, neither is woman&nbsp; independent of man, nor is man&nbsp; independent of woman.<br />\n1Cor. 11:12 For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man has his birth through the woman; and&nbsp; all things&nbsp; originate&nbsp; from God.<br />\n1Cor. 11:13&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?<br />\n1Cor. 11:14 Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,<br />\n1Cor. 11:15 but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her for a covering.<br />\n1Cor. 11:16 But if one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor have&nbsp; the churches of God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>We quoted this entire passage, because the context is essential to correctly interpreting Paul&#39;s comments on hair length.</p>\n\n<p>In this passage Paul is contending with a situation in the Corinthian church where women had rebelled against male headship and authority. He cites two specific cases of rebellion: the traditions of head coverings and&nbsp;hair length.</p>\n\n<p>First, the first case involved women wearing a head covering, typically a shawl draped over the hair. Wearing such a head covering was required of women at all times in public, including in church services.&nbsp;It symbolized the woman being under the authority of God and her husband or father. If a woman refused to wear a covering, it was considered an act of rebellion and protest (somewhat like women in the United States burning their bras in the 1970s to protest sexism).</p>\n\n<p>Men also followed a custom of wearing a head covering in public, but unlike women men were required to&nbsp;<em>remove</em> their head covering when entering a synagogue or church. By exposing their heads, men demonstrated they were under the Lord&#39;s authority. So while women were expected to use a head covering in church, men were required to remove a head covering in church. (Some Christian congregations choose to follow this practice still today.) If either sex were to go against these traditions, it was considered an act of rebellion and protest.</p>\n\n<p>The second case was hair length. Contrary to the Hollywood movies depicting men with shoulder-length locks, men traditionally wore their hair short unless they were under a vow (<em>see Acts 18:18</em>). Women, on the other hand, traditionally let their hair grow long. In the same way as the head coverings, if a man or woman went against these traditions, it was considered an act of rebellion.</p>\n\n<p>In the Corinthian church, some women were refusing to wear their head coverings in church and some had even shaved their heads entirely. These actions were intended to make the women look like men as a way of proclaiming they were equal in authority with men, and they constituted a bold and offensive protest against male church leaders, including Paul himself.</p>\n\n<p>It also seems these women may have justified their actions by claiming they had liberty in Christ to ignore tradition, but Paul begins this passage in v.2 by commending those who have held to the traditions. These traditions were important to Paul not because hair length and head coverings themselves were important, but because of the&nbsp;underlying issues of obedience and submission.</p>\n\n<p>If a woman refused to wear a head covering or if she shaved her head, she was making a statement that she wouldn&#39;t submit to the authorities placed over her by the Lord. She sent a message loud and clear to the men in the church, and she couldn&#39;t have communicated her protest any more clearly had she had written them on her forehead!</p>\n\n<p>Paul responds to their show of disobedience and disrespct for authority by commanding the women to return to the accepted traditions of his day. Again, Paul&#39;s orders are not for the purpose of mandating a certain hair length for all women forever; the context makes clear Paul&#39;s concern is for the women to demonstrate respect for authority. In this situation the only way for these women to correct the sin is to return to the accepted traditions of that day&nbsp;to reverse their misbehavior and regain a testimony of submission to authority.</p>\n\n<p>Notice how Paul ended this passage. He said if someone (meaning these women) is inclined to be contentious (i.e., not follow the traditions), there will be no other alternative offered. In other words, if the women want to continue their protests in the hope of forcing a different arrangement or changing the traditions, Paul says he is not willing to negotiate. The traditions will stand.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Bible doesn&#39;t mandate a specific hair length for women today. Instead, the Bible mandates that Christian (men and women) submit to authority and conform to the traditions and guidelines of their church. To do otherwise is a display rebellion and disrespect for authority.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. I was baptized as an infant, and later as a young adult I was confirmed and made a profession of faith. &nbsp;Was my baptism as an infant sufficient or do I need to be baptized again by immersion under water?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. First, we recommend reading this <a href=\"/resource_library/questions_and_answers/is_baptism_required_for_salvation/\">background article</a> on baptism (both water baptism and baptism of the Spirit).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the command of scripture concerning water baptism is always the same: believe and be baptized...in that order.&nbsp; Water baptism is an act of obedience that only a believer can take. An unbeliever (or someone too young to profess faith publicly) simply cannot fulfill the Biblical command to be baptized. They cannot obey Christ until they are able to profess faith and choose to be baptized.</p>\n\n<p>See the following example verses:</p>\n\n<h5>Acts 2:38 Peter said to them, &ldquo; Repent, and each of you be&nbsp; baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</h5>\n\n<h5>Acts 2:41 So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and that day there were added about three thousand&nbsp;&nbsp; souls.</h5>\n\n<h5>Acts 8:13 Even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, and as he observed&nbsp; signs and&nbsp; great miracles taking place, he was constantly amazed.</h5>\n\n<h5>Acts 9:18 And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight, and he got up and was baptized;</h5>\n\n<h5>Acts 10:47 &ldquo; Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who&nbsp; have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>Acts 10:48 And he&nbsp; ordered them to be baptized&nbsp; in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.</h5>\n\n<h5>Acts 18:8&nbsp; Crispus,&nbsp; the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord&nbsp; with all his household, and many of the&nbsp; Corinthians when they heard were believing and being baptized.</h5>\n\n<h5>Acts 22:16 &lsquo;Now why do you delay?&nbsp; Get up and be baptized, and&nbsp; wash away your sins,&nbsp; calling on His name.&rsquo;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Biblical form of baptism is for a professing believer to voluntarily enter a body of water so as to be immersed (for the reasons mentioned in our article referenced above). The form of baptism practiced by some denominations in which a baby is sprinkled with water is not Biblical baptism because it precedes saving faith and is not a conscience choice of the one being baptized. Therefore, it carries no spiritual significance according to scripture. It is a man-made ritual.</p>\n\n<p>If you have come to faith in Jesus Christ but have never stepped into the water to receive baptism as a public display of obedience to Christ, then we strongly urge you to take this step. We believe you have brought this question to our attention because the Holy Spirit is prompting you to take this step, and we know from experience He will bless your obedience. (By the way, scripture permits any believer who has been baptized by immersion to then baptize another believer&hellip;pastor not required!)</p>\n\n<p>Family and church traditions (like infant baptism) can be difficult to set aside in our walk of faith, but our allegiance must be to scripture and to the Spirit of the Lord and not to rituals or tradition.&nbsp; We pray our words will be encouraging and ring true in your heart.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<h5><strong><em>Q. What does the Bible say about mothers working outside the home?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>A.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">There are at least two distinct New Testament scripture references that have something to say about a woman&#39;s role in the home.</span></p>\n\n<h5><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Tim. 5:11 &nbsp;But refuse to put younger widows on the list, for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to get married,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Tim. 5:12 &nbsp;thus incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous&nbsp; pledge.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Tim. 5:13 &nbsp;At the same time they also learn to be idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also&nbsp; gossips and&nbsp; busybodies, talking about&nbsp; things not proper to mention.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Tim. 5:14 &nbsp;Therefore, I want younger widows to get&nbsp; married, bear children, keep house, and&nbsp; give the enemy no occasion for reproach;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Tim. 5:15 &nbsp;for some&nbsp; have already turned aside to follow&nbsp; Satan.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In v.14 Paul teaches that young widows, who are still of marrying age,&nbsp;should remarry, bear children, keep house and refrain from idleness. Based on the context of this passage, we see Paul is concerned about idleness among younger women, who lack a purpose or opportunity to serve others.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In Paul&#39;s day, women&nbsp;served society primarily by caring for&nbsp;a husband and family, and&nbsp;women had few options for working outside the home. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore,&nbsp;a young widow who remained single might find herself with little or nothing to occupy her days, and she&nbsp;would almost certainly become a financial burden on others in the church, which&nbsp;Paul says is not conducive to promoting godliness.</span></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/homemaker 1.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 290px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 0px 8px; float: right;\" />To avoid this situation, Paul commands&nbsp;young widows to \"keep house.\" When Paul says \"keep house,\" he&nbsp;uses the Greek word&nbsp;<em>oikodespoteo</em>, which literally means to rule a household. Paul was counseling women to desire for the role God gave by remarrying and running a household rather than remaining single and without a purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Fast forwarding to the modern world of today, single (and married) women have many other options to avoiding idleness and dependence on others. Therefore, we know&nbsp;marriage is no longer the only path to godliness and usefulness. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">n light of these cultural changes, we must consider whether&nbsp;Paul&#39;s command for single women to marry and work in the home are still relevant today? Can a woman seek employment outside the home without violating the instructions of 1Tim 5?&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Before we can reach that&nbsp;conclusion, let&#39;s consult&nbsp;a second&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">passage found in Titus:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Titus 2:3 &nbsp;Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior,&nbsp; not malicious gossips nor&nbsp; enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Titus 2:4 &nbsp;so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Titus 2:5 &nbsp;to be sensible, pure,&nbsp;workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Looking at the passage,&nbsp;Paul again says that a woman should be a worker at home, and his word choice here&nbsp;is similar to his statement in 1Tim 5: Paul means a&nbsp;woman should work to create order in the home. Here again&nbsp;Paul is emphasizing the importance of a woman&#39;s responsibility to attend to the&nbsp;duty of running a household.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Paul is asking a women to embrace the role of overseer in a home, which is the role&nbsp;God has assigned women to the&nbsp;benefit of themselves, the&nbsp;family and society as a whole. Overseeing the home environment is an honorable and essential mission worthy of a woman&#39;s pursuit.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Paul&#39;s instructions&nbsp;in&nbsp;Titus 2 are&nbsp;much harder to dismiss as culturally obsolete than his instructions in 1Tim 5. For example,</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Paul&nbsp;says that young women should be encouraged by older, more mature women&nbsp;to love their husbands and to love their children. Certainly, these commands are still in effect today&nbsp;and not dependent on culture. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Later in the passage&nbsp;Paul says&nbsp;women are to&nbsp;be&nbsp;workers at home, and that they are&nbsp;to be subject to their husband&#39;s authority. Once again, we know that the authority of a husband over a wife remains&nbsp;a biblical imperative today, so can we reasonably conclude that only&nbsp;the command for women to oversee&nbsp;the home has expired yet the other commands&nbsp;have not?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It seems far more reasonable to&nbsp;conclude that Paul intended this command to be as timeless as the rest. Therefore, we view&nbsp;both 1Tim and Titus to teach that it is the Lord&#39;s desire for every&nbsp;godly woman to&nbsp;fulfill her proper duty in overseeing her household.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As long as there are families and households, women are appointed by God to oversee the affairs of the home. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The husband is the spiritual authority over the family, and men also bear&nbsp;significant responsibilities around the house,&nbsp;but a woman has the primary responsibility to care for the home environment, and&nbsp;a husband is wise to acknowledge his wife&#39;s responsibility to do so!&nbsp;God created&nbsp;woman with this mission in mind, and so He blessed them with the temperment, sensibilities&nbsp;and instincts&nbsp;best suited to meet the challenges of this role.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So if a woman is God&#39;s appointed caretaker for the home, the&nbsp;question remains can a woman meet this responsibilty while also accepting employment&nbsp;outside the home?&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">An&nbsp;answer is found in Proverbs:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Prov. 31:10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An excellent wife, who can find?<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;for her worth is far&nbsp; above jewels.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Prov. 31:11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Give her the&nbsp; product of her hands, a</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">nd let her works praise her in the gates.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In this passage, Solomon says an excellent wife honors her husband by working diligently and fulfilling her duties to care for him and his household.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;The word excellent in Hebrew (<em>chayil</em>) is actually the word for strength or power, reflecting how this wife is an example of a strong and capable woman who excels in the performance of&nbsp;her duties.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Consider the wide variety of duties this&nbsp;wife accomplishes in her work:&nbsp;acquiring wool and flax (v.13);&nbsp;shopping for food her family will enjoy (v.14); caring for the needs of others in the home (v.15); working long hours (v.18); craftmaking (vv.19); showing charity (v.20);&nbsp;shopping for the needs of home (v.13);&nbsp;teaching in the home (v.26); and&nbsp;raising her children well (v.28). These were&nbsp;the normal duties of an&nbsp;industrious mother and wife working to keep&nbsp;an orderly home.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Looking more closely at the list, however, we also notice the wife&nbsp;working outside the home to conduct commerce by making and&nbsp;selling her goods in her own business (v.24);&nbsp;investing money in real estate&nbsp;(v.16);&nbsp;conserving household wealth (v.8);&nbsp;remaining industrious (v.27) and generally working hard in partnership with her husband for the good of the family.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"working mom\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/workingmom.jpg\" style=\"opacity: 0.9; width: 260px; height: 325px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 0px 8px; float: left;\" /></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In summary, Solomon says an \"excellent\"&nbsp;wife works both inside&nbsp;and outside&nbsp;her home to&nbsp;ensure the sanctity and orderliness of the home environment.&nbsp;This passage&nbsp;strongly supports the conclusion that a woman may fulfill her duties in caring for the home while also seeking outside employment. In fact, employment outside the home can directly&nbsp;support the needs of the household&nbsp;when balanced with her duties inside the home, and&nbsp;scripture praises such a woman!</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">On the other hand, we must point out that if working outside the home causes a woman to neglect&nbsp;the responsibilites&nbsp;inside the home, then the woman is acting against the counsel of&nbsp;scripture. When a mother decides to seek employment outside the home, her God-given responsibilties to run the affairs of the household do not diminish or transfer to the husband. On the contrary, her decision to&nbsp;work outside her home should be calculated to enhance her ability to run the household, not detract from it.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So in considering all three passages quoted above, what do we conclude about a mother&#39;s responsibilities inside and outside the home? </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">First, it&#39;s clear the orderliness of a family&#39;s home life is the mother&#39;s primary ministry, as given by God.&nbsp;While everyone in the family, including the husband, must share in the work of keeping a home, the woman has the chief&nbsp;duty to maintain an orderly home.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Second, keeping the home involves much more than simply doing housework; it includes managing all aspects of a peaceful and nurturing home environment including&nbsp;meals, upbringing of children, supplies, planning and scheduling family life,&nbsp;and even in contributing to the wealth of&nbsp;the household&nbsp;through employment and by careful husbanding of existing resources. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Third, there is nothing in scripture to preclude a wife or mother from seeking employment outside the home, so a Christian woman has liberty to do so. In fact, in some cases outside employment&nbsp;may be the only way to ensure an orderly and secure&nbsp;atmosphere <em>inside</em> the home (i.e., single mothers).&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Fourth,&nbsp;if a woman chooses outside employment, she must still attend to her&nbsp;responsibilties&nbsp;to oversee&nbsp;the home. She must find a balance between serving in the home and working outside the home, which will not place her duties to her family at risk</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, any woman considering seeking employment outside the home might ask herself the following questions before deciding her course of action:</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">1. Does her husband agree with her decision? Is she submitting to his authority as she makes this decision?</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">2. If the woman has children, is her decision consistent with the Biblical command for a mother to \"love her children?\" Will her choice be in the best interests of her children?</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">3. Can she serve her family in the keeping of the home as God has required while still serving the obligations of her employer? When her responsibility to her family conflicts with the demands of her employer, is she prepared to give her family priority? &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If a woman believes she can fulfill her Biblical obligations in the home while also working outside the home, then she has liberty in Christ to do.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Each woman must decide what is best for her and her family in light of the counsel of the Holy Spirit and the word of God.</span></p>"

The verse you quote&nbsp;from Zechariah refers specifically to the battle of Armageddon during the last days of Tribulation, when the antichrist&#39;s forces surround Jerusalem and God defends Israel. It is not intended as a general promise to protect Israel through the United States or anyone else. You can learn more about this time in our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation study</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We know these words are not a general promise to protect Israel from all attaacks,&nbsp;because in the time since Zechariah wrote these words, God has allowed Jerusalem to be overrun and destroyed by many Gentile nations, including the Assyrians, Babylonians,&nbsp;Persians, Greeks, Romans, Mongolians, Arabs, Turks, etc. Presently, God is preserving a believing&nbsp;remnant of Israel, while placing&nbsp;Israel into exile and under punishment until a time of repentance at the return of Christ&nbsp;(a period defined in Daniel 9 as the Age of the Gentiles).</p>\n\n<p>The words of Zechariah reflect a coming&nbsp;change in the &ldquo;last days,&rdquo; a period of time defined by Jesus in Matthew 24, Paul in Second Thessolonians and elsewhere. During this time, the nation is re-gathered in preparation for the Lord&rsquo;s return.

In the end, the nation will be saved, as Paul says in Romans 11.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Nevertheless, there is no scriptural basis to believe that God will preserve Israel&rsquo;s current political boundaries prior to Christ&rsquo;s return &ndash; only that God will protect the city of Jerusalem against the forces of the Antichrist.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Is it permissible for a Christian to drink alcohol? My pastor does not allow church members or leaders&nbsp;to drink.</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. There is no prohibition in scripture against Christians drinking alcohol. On the contrary, numerous references in the New Testament reflect that drinking wine was a part of everyday life for Jesus and the disciples (as it was for all men). As most Bible students know,&nbsp;Jesus&rsquo; first miracle was turning water into wine at the wedding in Cana (John 2).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Paul recommends that Timothy drink wine occasionally for his health (1Tim 5:23), and Jesus Himself drank wine frequently as a required part of many Jewish festivals including the Passover meal of the Last Supper.&nbsp;If our Lord enjoyed wine Himself, then certainly it was not a sin.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Is the \"Wine\" in the Bible Just Grape Juice?</h4>\n\n<p>Some Bible teachers have argued that the wine in the Bible is not actually wine at all, but merely unfermented grape juice. Simply put, this assertion is false. Such a&nbsp;notion contradicts both scripture and history.</p>\n\n<p>First, t<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">hroughout the Old and New Testament, references to wine are always references to the fermented drink, not to unfermented juice. In both&nbsp;Hebrew and Greek, the Bible uses&nbsp;different words for grape juice than for wine.&nbsp;For example, in Numbers we find both words used together in the same context:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Num. 6:3 &nbsp;he shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar, whether made from wine or strong drink, nor shall he drink any grape juice nor eat fresh or dried grapes.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In this verse we find the word&nbsp;\"wine\"&nbsp;used in the first half of the verse, while \"grape juice\"&nbsp;is used in the second half of the verse. The words \"wine\" and \"grape juice\"&nbsp;are different Hebrew words with different meanings. One refers to an alcoholic drink (wine), while the other refers to a nonalcoholic drink (grape juice). Therefore, we can see that the&nbsp;Bible uses the word \"wine\" to mean something other than grape juice.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Secondly, in the New Testament&nbsp;we find further&nbsp;proof that the word wine refers to&nbsp;an alcoholic beverage&nbsp;in the story of the wedding in Cana, where the headwaiter compliments the bridegroom on serving&nbsp;high quality wine near the end of the celebration:</span></p>\n\n<h6>John 2:9 When the headwaiter tasted the water&nbsp; which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter&nbsp; called the bridegroom,&nbsp;<br />\nJohn 2:10 &nbsp;and said to him, &ldquo;Every man serves the good wine first, and when the people&nbsp; have&nbsp; drunk freely, then he serves the poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The tradition at parties is to serve the best wine first, when the drinkers are still thinking clearly and can discern the difference in quality. Once the attendees have had a few drinks, the host brings out the poorer quality (<em>i.e</em>., less expensive)&nbsp;wine, because few will notice or remember the dfference after the effects of the alcohol dull their judgment.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In John 2, the headwaiter at the wedding was pleasantly surprised to discover&nbsp;that the new wine was the better wine (because it was the product of&nbsp;Jesus&#39; miracle). By the circumstances and the nature of his remark, we must conclude that the&nbsp;\"wine\" in this story was the alcoholic drink, not merely unfermented grape juice.&nbsp;No guest&nbsp;would have reason to notice differences in the quality of unfermented grape juice (all grape juice is the same), nor would a host&nbsp;have any reason to hold back \"better\" grape juice for later in the evening. Only&nbsp;alcoholic wine varies in quality in the way the story suggests. Undoubtedly, the headwaiter was impressed by Jesus&#39; wine-making skills, not His juice-making skills. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, in ancient times it was virtually&nbsp;<em>impossible</em> to store unfermented grape juice. Without refridgeration or preservatives, grape juice quickly sours and becomes rancid. So in Jesus&#39; day, the safe way to store&nbsp;grape juice was&nbsp;to ferment it, because&nbsp;the alcohol in the wine prevented&nbsp;the juice&nbsp;from spoiling. This is why Jews often cut their wine with water to diminish the alcoholic effect, allowing them to drink more juice without becoming drunk.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Wide spread storage of unfermented grape juice did not become a reality until <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bramwell_Welch\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Welch</a> invented the&nbsp;pasteurizing of grape juice in 1869. Ironically, Welch was a Methodist minister opposed to Christians drinking alcohol, which motivated his research into ways of preserving&nbsp;unfermented grape juice. He was searching for a way to store nonalcoholic grape juice for use in the communion celebration, since until his invention, most churches had little choice but to use alcoholic&nbsp;wine in the Lord&#39;s Supper observance.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So any claims that Jesus and the disciples drank only unfermented grape juice instead of alcohol&nbsp;are false and wishful thinking by those opposed to alcohol. We know Jesus drank wine (as did His disciples)&nbsp;by the the clear teaching of scripture. Therefore, when someone&nbsp;teaches that drinking alcohol is sinful (apart from drukenness), they&nbsp;are&nbsp;misinterpreting scripture,&nbsp;misrepresenting Jesus actions, and trampling&nbsp;the liberty of other Christians.</span></p>\n\n<h4><br />\nRespecting Christian Liberty</h4>\n\n<p>When we consult the Bible on the topic of liberty, we find strong warnings against a Christian&nbsp;denying another his or her liberty in Christ.&nbsp;Romans 14 is a key chapter of scripture to guide us in this matter. Verses 1-9 teach the importance of allowing our brothers and sisters to hold different convictions about amoral matters. The word amoral refers to things that are neutral with respect to morality. Amoral matters are neither moral nor immoral by themselves; they have no inherent morality, and therefore they can be used for good or for evil purposes. Regarding amoral matters, we cannot establish absolute rules for Christian living that apply universally to all situations.</p>\n\n<p>A simple example will help illustrate this point. Watching television is neither a moral nor an immoral activity by itself. It is amoral. Nevertheless, watching television can become a moral or an immoral choice depending on what we&nbsp;choose to watch. If we&nbsp;choose to watch a religous broadcast or a nature show, then our choice is morally appropriate. On the other hand, if we&nbsp;choose to watch pornography, our actions become immoral <a href=\"/bible-answers/why_is_watching_pornography_sinful\">according to scripture</a>. So, watching television is amoral in and of itself, but it can be used in moral or immoral ways.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Alcohol\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/alcohol.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 280px; margin: 5px 10px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>Likewise, alcoholic beverages are amoral. They are neither moral nor immoral according to scripture, because we can find examples in the Bible of alcohol being used morally (e.g., in Jewish festivals or at the Last Supper) and immorally (e.g., in Genesis 9 when Noah becomes drunk in front of his sons). Like television, alcohol has no inherent morality, but it can be used in moral or immoral ways.</p>\n\n<p>All Christians enjoy liberty in Christ in all amoral matters, yet we are still accountable for the choices we make. We are free to determine for ourselves what the Holy Spirit wishes us to do in these areas of our lives, but we must guard against allowing our choices&nbsp;to become immoral in the way we exercise our liberty. Many Christians choose to enjoy alcoholic beverages in moderation, and they may do so with a clear conscience knowing the Holy Spirit&nbsp;and scripture have given us liberty to partake of such things.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, knowing we have liberty to drink alcohol is not the end of the story. Romans 14 also stresses that significant responsibility accompanies our liberty. Believers should not impose their personal convictions on others as matters of law (i.e., legalism), but neither should Christians flaunt their liberty before others who do not share the same convictions. When we try to force our liberty upon others, we risk causing them to stumble in their walk, meaning we influence them to go against their convictions, which is sin (James 4:17).</p>\n\n<p>In Romans 14:21-22 Paul teaches that we should not use amoral issues (e.g.,&nbsp;eating meat or drinking wine, etc.) to drive a wedge between members of the body of Christ. We shouldn&rsquo;t allow our liberty to be the cause for our brother to stumble.</p>\n\n<p>This principle of scripture works both ways. If we&nbsp;persuade others to drink against their convictions, then we&nbsp;cause them&nbsp;to stumble; and if they try to guilt us for enjoying alcohol, then they cause us to stumble by casting doubt upon our freedoms. Both attempts to persuade the other are misguided, according to Romans 14, because n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">o Christian should force his or her convictions in amoral matters upon another. To each his own, according to his own conscience, as Romans 14 teaches.</span></p>\n\n<h4><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Scriptural Limitations on the Use of Alcohol</span></h4>\n\n<p>There are a few specific prohibitions in scripture regarding alcohol. First, drinking to the point of drunkeness is never appropriate for a Christian under any circumstances (Eph 5:18).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, leaders within the church may be held to stricter standards with respect to the appropriate use of alcohol (though scripture does not prohibit a pastor or other&nbsp;church leader from drinking). Church leaders must be especially mindful of how they conduct themselves in amoral matters, because they are alwasy on display within the body as examples of good conduct. Especially when it comes to food and drink, church leaders should be quick to set aside personal liberty whenever necessary for the sake of the Gospel.</p>\n\n<p>Many churches and ministry organizations require their leadership to abstain from drinking alcohol in public situations (or in some cases, entirely), because these organizations want to avoid the perception of immorality or to be sensitive to&nbsp;other cultures, where consumption of alcohol by Christians is considered taboo. These self-imposed prohibitions are entirely appropriate, and anyone&nbsp;who is called to serve in these organizations should be prepared to respect these restirctions as a matter of submission to authority.</p>\n\n<p>So, if your church prohibits its leaders (or even its congregation)&nbsp;from drinking alcohol, then submit to the church&#39;s authority on this matter, at least as long as you are called to serve or congregate&nbsp;in that church. Remember, adopting a stricter standard is always an option for the individual Christian living under liberty, so long as our personal choices do not become a legalistic standard we impose on others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you are not willing to forgo liberty, then you should consider finding a new church home more compatible with your personal convictions. There is nothing wrong with one congregation adopting a strict prohibition against alcohol while another has no such prohibitions, so long as both congregations teach that drinking alcohol is not a sin. While we have liberty&nbsp;to tighten our personal or corporate convictions concerning drinking alcohol, we <strong>do not</strong> have liberty to distort or misrepresent the Bible&#39;s teaching on the topic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, we must be prepared to restrict our personal liberty anytime it comes&nbsp;into conflict with the purposes of the Gospel. As Paul says in 1Corinthians:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 9:19 &nbsp;For though I am&nbsp; free from all men, I have made myself&nbsp; a slave to all, so that I may&nbsp; win more.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 9:20&nbsp; To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win Jews; to those who are under&nbsp; the Law, as under&nbsp; the Law though&nbsp; not being myself under&nbsp; the Law, so that I might win those who are under&nbsp; the Law;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 9:21 &nbsp;to those who are&nbsp; without law,&nbsp; as without law, though not being without the law of God but&nbsp; under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 9:22 &nbsp;To the&nbsp; weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become&nbsp; all things to all men,&nbsp; so that I may by all means save some.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 9:23 &nbsp;I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of it.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Some weaker Christians&nbsp;might observe&nbsp;us enjoying the freedom we have in Christ to drink, misunderstand what they see,&nbsp;and by our example stumble into sin. For the sake of our weaker brothers and sisters in Christ,&nbsp;we must judge each circumstance&nbsp;carefully, placing our desires secondary to the needs of the Gospel. For example, in a gathering of close friends,&nbsp;we might choose to enjoy a glass of wine confident&nbsp;we won&#39;t offend anyone&#39;s conscience, while in a larger gathering of church members, we would decide it&#39;s wiser&nbsp;to abstain from alcohol out of an abundance of caution.</p>\n\n<p>All Christians are expected to use good judgment in light of their circumstances, always following the leading of the Holy Spirit. If you have a personal conviction not to drink alcohol at all, then follow your convictions, but don&#39;t expect all Christians to follow suit. Each Christian&nbsp;makes&nbsp;the right choice&nbsp;when they&nbsp;follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in accordance with scripture.</p>\n\n<h4><br />\nWarning for Parents</h4>\n\n<p>Finally, we would like to offer some parenting advice: teach your believing children about the liberty we have in Christ. Teach them to study the Bible and follow what it teaches. Teach them to follow their own convictions by listening to the leading of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to be responsible in all they choose to do, including in their choice to drink alcohol. Teach them about the dangers of abusing alcohol, and teach them to be mindful at all times of their witness for Christ.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, don&#39;t teach your children that the Bible <em>prohibits</em> drinking alcohol, because this is not true. Despite our good intentions, teaching scripture wrongly will only cause trouble for our children in the long run. Sooner or later the enemy will seize upon our teaching errors and use them in an effort to draw our children away from God&rsquo;s word.</p>\n\n<p>One day your children will read in the Gospels that Jesus said He looks forward to enjoying wine with us again in the kingdom (Matt 26:29), and when they see this, they will ask why their parents taught that wine was evil? At that moment, they may have reason to question everything we have taught, which would be unfortunate. Therefore, we need to provide our children with the accurate biblical view of alcohol while guiding them in making sound decisions. We want our children to trust us, but most of all, we want them to trust God&rsquo;s word.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Does the Bible require a Christian to tithe? My pastor says a Christian should give ten percent to the church, but I can&rsquo;t find that in my Bible.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A. Tithing in the Church has often been a source of confusion and debate, but as usual, Scripture gives us clear direction.</p>\n\n<p>First, the word <em>tithe</em> simply means tenth, and the first use of the word occurs in Gen 14:20, when Abraham gives a tenth of his war spoils to the high priest, Melchizedek. Later, God incorporated the principle of tithing into His Law, and specified the rules Israel would follow in tithing.</p>\n\n<p>In the Law, God requires three distinct kinds of tithing for Jews. First, Jews were required to tithe to support the Levite priests (Num 18:21-24). Since the priests were devoted entirely to serving the Lord in the temple, tithes were collected from the other tribes to support priests.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the Jews&nbsp;were required to give an additional tithe in support of the three festivals of Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles (Deut 12; Deut 14:22-26). These three key festivals were funded by the tithes of the Jewish community.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Jews were instructed to give another tithe every third year for the poor (Deut 14:28-29). Taken together, all three tithes totaled between twenty to thirty percent of a Jew&#39;s income, depending on the year.</p>\n\n<p>Where did a Jew give their tithe? In Malachi 3:8-10, a Jew was taught to tithe to the \"storehouse,\" which meant the Temple coffers. The Jew brought his gifts to the Temple, and the Temple authorities distributed the funds according to God&#39;s Law and direction. Under the Law, the Jew was not free to decide for himself where to direct his tithing but always had to give it to the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the term \"tithe\" refers to Jews giving roughly 23% of their annual income (on average) to the temple authorities. This is the only biblical meaning for the term.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Is the&nbsp;Christian Required to Tithe?</h4>\n\n<p>First,&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">the concept of tithing is completely missing from the New Testament, because it is literally impossible for a Christian to tithe in the way scripture requires. As we explained above, tithing is a concept found only in the Law of Moses and commanded only of Jews. Furthermore, the purpose of tithing was&nbsp;to&nbsp;financially support the Levitical priesthood, the operation of the temple and the conduct of the Jewish festivals in Jerusalem. Obviously, the priesthood and temple no longer exist in Israel, so it is literally&nbsp;</span>impossible for anyone &ndash; Jew or Christian &ndash; to tithe in the way scripture requires.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Most importantly, the Christian does not live under the requirements of the Law of Moses (Rom 6:14; 7:6; Gal 5:18), so&nbsp;the requirements of the Old Testament Law do not apply&nbsp;to the New Testament believer. Furthermore, there is no New Testament command for Christians to tithe, whether to the church or to anyone else.&nbsp;</span>This conclusion bears repeating: <strong><em>a Christian is never commanded by any scripture to tithe to anyone</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">On the other hand, tithing is a very specific form of giving, and while&nbsp;Christians are not commanded to tithe, we are instructed to give generously to the needs of the saints. So how should the New Testament believer approach giving?</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">According to the Bible, the&nbsp;Christian is expected to give generously to the needs of the saints, according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;Paul taught this point specifically in 2Corinthians 8, as did James in his letter.</span></p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the New Testament <strong>never</strong> specifies&nbsp;<strong><em>how much</em></strong> a believer should give nor <i><strong>to whom</strong>&nbsp;</i>a&nbsp;believer should give. All giving is to be voluntary, done without compulsion, and according to the leading of the Holy Spirit both in the amount and the destination. In other words,&nbsp;the believer enjoys liberty in this area&nbsp;just as he or she does in many other areas of the Christian life.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>The New Testament Model for Giving</h4>\n\n<p>Though we have liberty, the Bible&nbsp;does stipulate general guidelines on the frequency and manner of our giving (not tithing). We find those instructions in 1Corinthians 16:1-2:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 16:1 &nbsp;Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so do you also.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 16:2 &nbsp;On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>In writing to the church in Corinth, Paul said he gave these same instructions to the church in Galatia, therefore we know Paul&#39;s directions were a model for early Christians (and therefore for us as well). In this brief passage, Paul outlines seven requirements for Christian giving.</p>\n\n<p>First, Paul directed that giving should be a regular, consistent habit. Giving should be a way of life for a Christian so that it becomes a part of our financial routine. When giving isn&#39;t routine, we may find ourselves less willing to give generously when needs arise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, to ensure regularity&nbsp;Paul directed the church in Corinth to give on the first day of every week. Paul wasn&#39;t necessarily establishing a rule for what day we must give. Rather, Paul was giving an example of how to become regular and consistent in giving. Whether we give on Sundays or any other day, we should discipline ourselves to give in a consistent pattern (i.e., weekly or monthly) rather than only when it&#39;s convenient.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, Paul says \"each of you\" should give. Giving is the responsibility of every individual Christian, not just of a Christian household. Even if the head of the household produces all the family income, it is still important for every Christain living in the home to participate in the distribution of the family giving. This opportunity trains younger family members to give and allows everyone to share in the blessing of giving.</p>\n\n<p>Fourthly, Paul specified that our giving be \"to the saints.\" Just as the Jewish tithe was for the benefit of the priesthood or the Jewish people overall, likewise Christian giving is for the benefit of other Christians, whether for their personal needs or for official ministerial functions.&nbsp;Though our giving to the Lord should always be directed to Christian individuals or causes, we are always free to make additional charitable contributions to other organizations as we please.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Fifthly, Paul asked that collections <em>not</em> be made \"when I come.\" This curious addition suggests Paul was concerned that his arrival might become an occasion for taking a special collection. Paul knew that if giving were based merely on special occasions (i.e., Paul&#39;s visit) rather than as a result of regular, disciplined sacrifice, it would lead to an unhealthy and unsustainable pattern. Paul didn&#39;t want regular giving to become an exception rather than the rule.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, Paul did not want his visit to be exploited by church leaders for fundraising. Paul wanted his arrival to be refreshing for the people rather than burdensome. This detail&nbsp;is a stinging rebuke for&nbsp;any minister who requires an honorarium or other stipend as a prerequisite to teaching or ministering to a body of believers.</p>\n\n<p>Sixthly, Paul instructs our giving should be in keeping with our prosperity (v.2, \"as he may prosper\"). The New Testament believer is to give according to the Spirit, but the specific amount of our giving should vary according to our means. Poor believers will naturally give less than rich believers. Again, Paul didn&#39;t specify the amount, but he did connect the Christian&#39;s degree of generosity to his prosperity, so we should expect to give more as we earn more.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Paul gives no specific destination for our giving, but says our&nbsp;giving is to be done by \"putting aside in savings.\" This is an important (and rarely followed) practice. The literal phrase in Greek in verse 2 means \"to store up privately.\" Paul&#39;s expectation was that the believers in Corinth would consistently set aside some of their earnings reserved for the needs of the saints. The believer wouldn&rsquo;t distribute these funds until a need presented itself, so until there was a need, their weekly giving would remain \"stored up\" privately.</p>\n\n<p>Giving was conducted this way, in part, because the early church didn&#39;t own buildings, nor did it maintain church bank accounts. Therefore, the church wasn&#39;t in a position to collect and store tithes. Instead, the money remained in the hands of the individual believer until it was needed for some specific purpose within the Body, at which time each believer would be asked to withdraw some funds from their savings and give it in support of the need. This is why Paul wanted believers to save each week &ndash;&nbsp;so that they could be ready to give a donation when asked!</p>\n\n<p>Storing up privately is a perfectly appropriate form of New Testament giving today as well, provided the Christian is self-disciplined enough to store and distribute the funds as the Holy Spirit leads. Like all New Testament giving, it should be done freely, without obligation, according to the Holy Spirit and for the benefit of the saints.</p>\n\n<p>In light of&nbsp;these seven requirements, a Christian may still choose to follow&nbsp;the traditional practice of giving ten percent of income directly to the&nbsp;local church on a regular basis,&nbsp;just as many Christians have chosen to do. Any Christian who feels led by the Holy Spirit to contribute in this manner may do so, but this is not the <em>only</em> way a Christian can approach giving. It is just one possible approach.&nbsp;Paul&#39;s teaching&nbsp;makes clear we may also store up privately and distribute to a wide variety of Christian needs according to the leading of the Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Every believer should guard against falling into any rigid practice of giving that isn&#39;t under the direction of the Holy Spirit. Christians are to be Spirit-led, not rule-driven.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Please explain the Order of Melchizedek? Why did God institute the Levitical Priesthood if the Order of Melchizedek preceded it and was the priesthood of Christ?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\"Melchizedek\" comes from two Hebrew words (<em>melek</em>,&nbsp;king&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>tzedeq,&nbsp;</em>righteous) and can be literally understood as \"my king is righteous.\"&nbsp;This is likely a&nbsp;title&nbsp;rather than a&nbsp;name.&nbsp;Melchizedek is mentioned only three places in Scripture: Genesis 14, Psalm 110, and Hebrews chapters 5, 6, and 7.</p>\n\n<p>The \"order\" of Melchizedek is not a monastic society or secret order; it is a&nbsp;sequential&nbsp;order or priestly leadership over God&rsquo;s people.&nbsp;The order of Melchizedek began with Adam, who was the first representative of God (i.e., priest) on earth. He was of the order of Melchizedek because it was an order granted by God and intended to exist for eternity. There can only be one man serving as Melchizedek at any given time, so the title is&nbsp;passed down from father to son, generation to generation, upon the&nbsp;death of the prior priest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The order of Melchizedek was Adam&#39;s until he died, and then the title was passed to his son Seth. From Seth, the title passed from father to son (or grandson). Noah inherited the title when Methuselah died even though&nbsp;Noah was Methuselah&#39;s grandson, because Methuselah outlived his son, Lamech. Therefore, the order skipped over Lamech and went to Noah upon Methuselah&#39;s death. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Similarly, Enoch never inherited the order of Melchizedek because Enoch was \"translated\" off the earth before his father, Jared, died. The Bible calls Noah the eighth preacher of righteousness&nbsp;in 2 Peter 2:5, as reflected in this literal translation of the text from Young&#39;s Literal Translation:</span></p>\n\n<h5>2Pet. 2:5 and the old world did not spare, but the eighth person, Noah, of righteousness a preacher, did keep, a flood on the world of the impious having brought,</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Noah was the eighth man to hold the order of Melchizedek, the order of righteousness. When Noah died, the order was inherited by his son, Shem. &nbsp;</span>In Genesis a man with the title Melchizedek meets Abram returning from defeating the invading kings. This priest was Shem, the oldest living patriarch in the line of the seed promise in Abram&#39;s day.</p>\n\n<p>After Shem died, the title continued to be inherited from generation to generation until it reached Jesus of Nazareth through His earthly father, Joseph. The men who held this title were the Old&nbsp;Testament saints who carried the seed promise of Genesis 3. (For more detail on the seed promise, please listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis Bible study</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Once the title was passed to Jesus at the death of Joseph, it remains with Him forever as Hebrews teaches. Jesus was resurrected after death and is never to die again. Therefore, the title of \"Melchizedek&rdquo;&nbsp;will be His forever, and the \"order of Melchizedek&rdquo;&nbsp;is now an eternal order held by an eternal high priest, Christ. The procession of the Melchizedek order is important because it pictured an eternal High Priest for the Old Testament saint, and once it was Christ&rsquo;s, it&nbsp;demonstrates the sufficiency of Christ&rsquo;s work as our High Priest. This is the point being taught in Hebrews.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Why did another, lesser&nbsp;priesthood emerge in the Law of Moses? It was given as part of the Law to instruct and guard Israel while the world waited for the final Melchizedek (i.e., Christ) to arrive.&nbsp;Remember, there is nothing&nbsp;&ldquo;wrong&rdquo; or bad with the Mosaic Law. It has multiple good purposes in God&rsquo;s economy, including revealing humanity&#39;s sinful nature (Rom 3:20),&nbsp;demonstrating&nbsp;God&#39;s wisdom (Deut 4:5-8), and showing His righteousness (Isaiah 42:21) and holiness (Romans 7:12). (You can learn more about the Law and its purposes in our <a href=\"/bible-studies/exodus\">Exodus study</a>).</span></p>\n\n<p>On&nbsp;the&nbsp;other hand, we also know God&#39;s Law did not redeem humanity or bring about personal salvation. That was never its purpose. It serves a national&nbsp;purpose&nbsp;for the sake of Israel, including bringing great things to Israel in the future at the end of this age. (You can learn more about how the Law brings great things for Israel in our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation study</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The writer of the letter to the Hebrews makes the point that the Christ&#39;s work in the Melchizedek priesthood is greater than the work of the Levitical priesthood, so Jewish believers in his day would understand there was no longer value in observing the Levitical priesthood now that our true High Priest has arrived to assumed the Melchizedek title. The purpose of that lesser priesthood had been served once Christ appeared.</span></p>\n\n<p>Unlike the Levitical priesthood, Jesus&#39; priesthood and His sacrificial work&nbsp;were&nbsp;able to remove sin, cleanse the conscience, and purify the heart. As Hebrews 7:28 says, \"For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son,&nbsp;made perfect forever.&rdquo; In summary,&nbsp;Christ&#39;s work in redeeming humanity from their sins is a far greater thing than the Levitical priesthood&#39;s work in pointing out the need for such a redemption.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Law was given to Israel so they might understand the wisdom of God in providing a Messiah. New Testament believers are not bound to following the Old Testament Law (since a greater Law has been given to us in Christ), nevertheless, we can still benefit from learning about&nbsp;the Law and its lesser priesthood as an example of God&#39;s righteousness and holiness and the need for&nbsp;atonement.</span></p>\n\n<p>For a more in-depth explanation of Melchizedek, please listen to Lessons 7A &amp; 7B in our <a href=\"/bible-studies/hebrews\">Hebrews Bible study</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Is a person who engages in premarital sex with multiple partners considered \"married\" since they had \"one-flesh\" relationships with those partners? &nbsp;Are they still eligible to marry according to Scripture?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. A sexual encounter by itself does not constitute marriage, according to Scripture.&nbsp; If a person engages in sex before marriage, the person commits the sin of fornication, while a married person who commits a sexual act with someone who is not their spouse commits adultery.&nbsp; Neither fornication nor adultery is equal to marriage.&nbsp; In fact, they are sins because they are acts conducted outside the sanctity of marriage.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible defines marriage in this way:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 2:24&nbsp; For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>According to this description, a true Biblical marriage involves three parts.&nbsp; First, a man must \"leave\" his father and mother. The Hebrew word translated leave literally means to forsake or abandon, which says a man must transfer his personal allegiance from his parents to his new bride. In the years before a man takes a wife, his strongest human commitment is to his parents. God tells us to honor our mother and father, so a unmarried man&#39;s relationship with his parents takes precedence over every other earthly relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Once a man marries, however, his allegiance to his parents must become secondary to his allegiance to his wife. As a married man, he is expected to put the highest priority on his relationship with his wife, and though he still honors his parents, that honor cannot be greater than his honor for his wife. The process of leaving parents and cleaving to a wife typically includes a lifestyle change (i.e., making a new home with his wife), an authority change (i.e., assuming responsibility for his wife&#39;s spiritual direction), and a heart commitment (i.e., a recognition that this new relationship take priority over all other relationships).</p>\n\n<p>When a man engages in casual sex apart from marriage (i.e., fornication), he does not intend to \"leave\" his father and mother by such an encounter. A \"one night stand\" or casual sexual relationship brings no such expectations, and even if a man expresses some degree of commitment to his sexual partner, he is unlikely to grant their relationship priority over his parental relationship. More importantly, he makes no such transfer of allegiance in his heart.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Genesis 2 says in a true marriage the man will be \"joined\" to his wife. Having determined to leave his parents, the man must turn to his wife and make a commitment to her that lasts forever. The Hebrew word for \"joined\" means to cleave or to remain steadfast, and it describes a relationship that is inseparable. Having determined to leave his parents, the man must turn to his wife and make a commitment to her that lasts forever.&nbsp; Just as the physical parental relationship with a child can never cease, similarly a marriage relationship will never cease until death.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, a true marriage requires a lifelong commitment from the man to love and care for the woman in marriage, and this commitment is expressed through a marriage covenant ceremony. While the ceremony itself can vary, the purpose is always the same: to give opportunity for the couple to pledge a life-long commitment to their new relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Couples who enter into a marriage covenant adopt a variety of signs and symbols to communicate their commitment to the world, including exchanging rings and vows publicly, signing legal documents, changing their names, calling each other husband and wife, etc. Taken together, these practices communicate clearly that both the man and woman acknowledge their participation in a life-long marriage covenant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Casual sexual relationships (and even long-term sexual relationships) are not equal to marriage because they lack the necessary formality of a personal pledge and life-long commitment to marriage. The sexual relationship lacks the signs and symbols of marriage, and more importantly the couple themselves lacks the perspective that they are married.&nbsp; If someone asked them to describe their relationship, the couple would likely say they were \"only dating\" or \"just friends.\"</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a true marriage requires the couple become \"one flesh.\" A married couple is expected to consummate the marriage through sexual intercourse (or in the case where sexual activity isn&#39;t possible, they forsake other sexual encounters). Though all sexual encounters establish \"one-flesh\" relationships (see 1Cor 6:16), not every one-flesh relationships is equal to marriage since the relationship lacks the other Biblical components.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, a marriage relationship involves, a forsaking of parent relationships, the entering into a marriage covenant, and a sexual union where possible. If a sexual union takes place without the first two components, then the relationship is not a marriage but is sin.</p>\n\n<p>Though a person who engages in sexual intercourse prior to marrying commits the sin of fornication, they are still eligible to marry. Once a person has entered into a marriage, however, they may never again seek sexual gratification outside of the marriage relationship, or else they commit adultery.</p>\n\n<p>You can read more about this topic in our article on <a href=\"/bible-answers/can-a-believer-divorce-or-remarry\"><strong>Marriage and Divorce</strong></a>.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. You teach that Christians are not under the Law of Moses, so we do not observe a Sabbath day but God established the Sabbath in Genesis. Also, God&#39;s word is forever and cannot change, so why do Christians not have to observe a Sabbath?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. You are correct that the Sabbath Day was established in Genesis 2, when the Lord set it apart (i.e., consecrated it). The day was set apart from the other six days of the week not to establish a day of physical rest for men (that purpose wasn&#39;t associated with the day until thousands of years later during the giving of the Law to Israel), but rather&nbsp;the Lord set it apart for Himself to establish an important spiritual picture to teach about resting in Christ.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In reality, there are three Sabbaths mentioned in Scripture, and all are related in an important way. First, the Lord created a&nbsp;Sabbath for Himself&nbsp;in Genesis 2. The Lord did all the work and He earned a permanent, eternal rest His work of Creation. Secondly, there is the&nbsp;Sabbath established in Exodus 20 for Israel. Isreal worked six days a week, and then Israel enjoyed a single day of temporary rest under the Law of Moses. Finally, there is a&nbsp;Sabbath established in Christ is for all believers. Christ did all the work of salvation, and Christians enjoy a Sabbath from works of salvation when they trust in Christ alone. (</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The book of Hebrews teaches the&nbsp;relationship between these Sabbaths&nbsp;in chapter 4.)</span></p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the&nbsp;Bible teaches that Christians are not subject to the Law of Moses, but this does not mean that we are under no law at all.&nbsp; On the contrary, Christian are bound by a law that prohibits murder, stealing, coveting and countless other offenses, because Christians are bound to the much stricter law called the Law of Christ (or the law of Liberty, as James calls it).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This law calls us to obey Jesus&#39; commandments in every area of our life - both in action and in our heart&#39;s desires - and to remain holy in areas of our behavior and thoughts that the Old Covenant Law never even attempted to regulate (i.e., lusting).</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested to learn more about how the Sabbath is fulfilled by our faith in Christ and about the law of Christ, our ministry has several articles and related Bible study teachings on the topics of the Sabbath and the Christian&#39;s relationship to the Law, and we encourage you to consult these resources to understand the Bible&#39;s teaching. In particular, we recommend the following articles:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/which_day_is_the_true_sabbath/\"><strong>Which day is the correct Sabbath day?</strong></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/how_should_a_christian_approach_the_sabbath/\"><strong>How should a Christian approach the Sabbath?</strong></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/how_should_a_christian_approach_the_sabbath/\"><strong>On Law and Liberty</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we also acknowledge that many churches and denominations still teach that Christians are bound to the Old Covenant Law and are obligated to observe a day of rest or Sabbath day. These teachings are based on traditions that run deep in our Christian culture (but are not grounded in a proper view of Scripture), so many Christians have come to accept this teaching without personally studying the counsel of Scripture on this important point.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, tradition is not to be the basis for our Christian understanding and living, since our church traditions (and even our church leaders) can be in error, which is why the Bible commands us to seek the Scriptures daily to know the truth through the teaching of the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>While there is nothing wrong with choosing to observe a Sabbath Day (whether Saturday or Sunday) if you feel convicted to do so, just remember that your convictions may not be shared by other believers, and they have liberty in Christ to follow a different practice.</p>\n\n<p>Verse By Verse Ministry is committed to teaching only the truth of Scripture even when it conflicts with church tradition.&nbsp; Remember the words of Jesus in addressing the Pharisees, who were guilty of teaching religious traditions rather than God&#39;s word:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 15:3 And He answered and said to them, &ldquo;Why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?<br />\nMatt. 15:4 &ldquo;For God said, &lsquo; HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,&rsquo; and, &lsquo; HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER IS TO&nbsp; BE PUT TO DEATH.&rsquo;<br />\nMatt. 15:5 &ldquo;But you say, &lsquo;Whoever says to his father or mother, &ldquo;Whatever I have that would help you has been&nbsp; given to God,&rdquo;<br />\nMatt. 15:6 he is not to honor his father or his mother .&rsquo; And by this you invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition.<br />\nMatt. 15:7 &ldquo;You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you:<br />\nMatt. 15:8 &lsquo; THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS,<br />\nBUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.<br />\nMatt. 15:9 &lsquo;BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME,<br />\nTEACHING AS&nbsp; DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>And again in Mark:</p>\n\n<h5>Mark 7:8 &ldquo;Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the&nbsp; tradition of men.&rdquo;<br />\nMark 7:9&nbsp; He was also saying to them, &ldquo;You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your&nbsp; tradition.</h5>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. I&#39;ve seen men and women \"speaking in tongues\" in my church and being \"filled\" by the Holy Spirit, but I&#39;m not sure what to think about the practice. Are these things consistent with the Bible&#39;s teaching?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The question&nbsp;of speaking in tongues is a hotly-debated issue within the church, one that often elicits&nbsp;strong emotions&nbsp;from both sides of the debate. Therefore,&nbsp;in settling this question, we have endeavored to provide a comprehensive and detailed answer, based on scripture, and addressing the most common&nbsp;points&nbsp;and counterarguments. Our article is quite lengthy, but we believe the controversial nature of this topic warrants an in-depth response.</p>\n\n<p>We have divided&nbsp;our answer into three arguments: a scriptural argument, a historical argument and a theological argument, and we begin with an introduction to tongues itself.</p>\n\n<h4><br />\nIntroduction on Tongues<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>First, we must understand speaking in tongues is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a practice of speaking in gibberish or chanting repetitive phrases or sounds. According to scripture, the true gift of speaking in tongues will always involve&nbsp;speaking a true human language complete with a syntax, vocabulary, and sentence structure.</p>\n\n<p>A \"tongue\" is the Bible&#39;s word for&nbsp;a real, understandable human language, and the gift of tongues means speaking in a foreign language&nbsp;that the person speaking does not know and cannot understand. If a&nbsp;tongue&nbsp;is spoken in the presence of a person who knows that language naturally, then that person will immediately understand the speech because it is natural language.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if an English-speaking Christian with the gift of tongues is prompted by the Spirit to speak in Spanish, then this believer will not understand his own speech, which is the essence of the miracle. Nevertheless, the speech is true Spanish, so though the speaker himself cannot understand his own tongue, anyone who knows Spanish will understand his speech perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>So when the Bible uses the term \"tongue,\" it is <em><strong>not</strong></em> describing a strange, non-human utterance. On the contrary, the term tongue in the Bible simply&nbsp;means&nbsp;normal, spoken human language.</p>\n\n<p>We can see this truth&nbsp;at work in Acts 2 when thousands of new Jewish Christians began to speak in unknown tongues at Pentecost. In Acts 2:4-8&nbsp;we see plainly that these \"tongues\" were normal, human languages that many foreigners in the crowd could understand naturally:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6>Acts 2:6 &nbsp;And when this sound occurred, the crowd came together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak in his own language.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Acts 2:7&nbsp; They were amazed and astonished, saying, &ldquo;Why, are not all these who are speaking&nbsp; Galileans?&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Acts 2:8 &nbsp;&ldquo;And how is it that we each hear them in our own language&nbsp; to which we were born?&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Acts 2:9 &nbsp;&ldquo;Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and&nbsp; Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Acts 2:10 &nbsp; Phrygia and&nbsp; Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around&nbsp; Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and &nbsp; proselytes,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Acts 2:11 &nbsp;Cretans and Arabs &mdash; we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>The miracle of the moment was the way the speakers themselves couldn&#39;t understand the words coming out of their own mouths, but this didn&#39;t require that they speak in gibberish or \"mysterious\" tongues. They simply spoke in foreign languages they didn&#39;t previously know. Truly, that was a miracle.</p>\n\n<p>So, speaking in tongues is never a practice of uttering gibberish or chanting repetitive sounds. The fact that so much of what passes as \"speaking in tongues\" today is clearly nothing more than babbling gibberish is our first clue that the modern-day practice of speaking in \"tongues\" is rife with error and false displays, rather than being a true work of the Spirit.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>The Scriptural Argument<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>The authoritative teaching on the gift of speaking in tongues is given by the Apostle Paul as part of an extended teaching from 1Cor 12-14. Time does not permit a full exposition of these chapters (a full explanation is available in our <a href=\"/bible-studies/first_corinthians\">1Corinthians study</a>), so we will summarize the most important points in these chapters, beginning with 1Cor 12:27-31:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 12:27 Now you are Christ&rsquo;s body, and individually members of it.<br />\n1Cor. 12:28 And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.<br />\n1Cor. 12:29 All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers of miracles, are they?<br />\n1Cor. 12:30 All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?<br />\n1Cor. 12:31 But earnestly desire the greater gifts.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>In the preceding verses of Chapter 12, Paul had taught that the Church is made up of individuals each with different God-given gifts, yet the Body can only function in a healthy way if it works as a team just as the various parts of the human body work together.</p>\n\n<p>The sin of the Corinthian church was that it elevated one gift (i.e., speaking in tongues) above all other gifts in importance and desirability, and the church taught all members to seek the attainment of that gift. Paul responded by teaching that this kind of thinking regarding spiritual gifts is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>First, not all Christians are given the same spiritual gift nor can we acquire spiritual gifts for ourselves merely because we desire them. God alone assigns spiritual gifts by the Spirit. Simply put, not every Christian has the same gift, and, therefore, it is impossible for every Christian to possess the gift of tongues (see 1Cor 12:30). Therefore, it is wrong for a church to teach believers they can (and must) acquire the gift of tongues, for this is impossible according to Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, in vs.27-31, Paul addresses a second mistake the Corinthian church made by elevating the gift of tongues above other gifts. The church assigned the gift of speaking in tongues an inappropriate importance within the celebration of the body. The church made speaking in tongues the highest priority gift, but in reality, Paul teaches that speaking in tongues is the lowest priority gift.</p>\n\n<p>In verse 28, Paul gives the correct order of importance for the expression of gifts within the Body. Paul&#39;s list in the original Greek language is presented as a hierarchical order, meaning that Paul was clearly setting forth an order of importance for the gifts of the Spirit. Specifically, Paul lists the gifts in&nbsp;diminishing order of importance moving&nbsp;down the list.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In verse 28, Paul begins with the most importance gift in the church: the gift of apostleship. The gift of apostleship was a unique and rare gift given within the body of Christ, and only a few men met the strict test required for apostleship (i.e., having been appointed by Christ&nbsp;and having the power of miracles to prove the office). Since Jesus is no longer making personal appearances to commission new apostles in the church, the gift of apostleship is no longer available in the church, though it did exist in Paul&#39;s day. (For an in-depth explanation of the gift of Apostles, please see our <a href=\"/bible-studies/acts_of_the_apostles\">Acts</a> study.)</span></p>\n\n<p>The second highest priority gift in Paul&#39;s list is the gift of prophecy. Prophecy involves the revealing of divinely-inspired knowledge of God and His plans. Scriptures tell us in Hebrews and Revelation that the canon is now closed, and no new divinely-inspired knowledge of God will be provided. Therefore, this gift (in the sense of giving scripture) has likewise become dormant in the church.</p>\n\n<p>Prophecy in a lesser form (i.e., foretelling of future events) may still be available in the church today, but in our experience this gift is frequently counterfeited and abused. Therefore we advise caution and discernment before accepting any person&#39;s claims to possessing the gift of \"prophecy\" in the church body. As with the prophets of old, we must apply a 100% accuracy test to any claim of prophecy. If a person claiming to have the gift of prophecy is wrong in their prediction even once, then that person was never a true prophet of God (see Deut 18:18-22).</p>\n\n<p>The third most important gift is the gift of teaching (e.g., the ability to communicate spiritual truth). Today in the church, the gift of teaching takes top priority within the Body, according to Paul&#39;s hierarchical list. From there, the list continues in decreasing priority from teaching to the gifts of miracles, healing, helps, administration, and various tongues (e.g., speaking in tongues, interpreting tongues, &amp; other speaking or exhortation gifts).</p>\n\n<p>According to Paul, the highest priority spiritual gift within the Body today is the gift of prophecy (where it is truly operating) and then the gift of teaching. The church should seek this gift first. Ironically, speaking in tongues is to be given lowest priority in the body of Christ. This is the exact opposite of what many modern-day movements are teaching!</p>\n\n<p>Remember, according to Paul a Christian cannot obtain a certain spiritual gift that God has not already given, nor can a Christian be \"coached\" or taught a spiritual gift. Only God appoints spiritual gifts, and, therefore, we will only have the gifts God grants us according to His will at the time of our salvation.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, Paul&#39;s prioritized list of gifts cannot be a \"wish list\" for an individual Christian, who seeks to acquire new gifts. Instead, Paul&#39;s list teaches the church the proper priority for the expression of gifts within the gathering. The church gathering should emphasize the use of higher priority gifts (e.g., prophecy &amp; teaching) over lesser spiritual gifts (e.g., speaking in tongues) because the greater gifts are more important to the spiritual health and maturity of the Christian.</p>\n\n<p>Based on Paul&#39;s teaching in this chapter, we learn the Corinthian church had focused their gather entirely (or at least mostly) on speaking in tongues rather than on teaching or other higher-priority spiritual activities. Furthermore, the church developed a false teaching that every member of the body could obtain the gift of tongues and should be expected to use it in unison. To correct this error, Paul writes that gifts can&#39;t be acquired; tongues may only be used under certain conditions, and in general, the church should seek for greater things than to see speaking in tongues exercised at all.</p>\n\n<p>This brings us to v.31, where Paul says the church should \"earnestly desire the greater gifts.\" The Greek word translated \"earnestly desire\" is zeloo, which can also be translated \"to seek zealously.\" To understand Paul&#39;s statement, we must ask who is to do this seeking, and what should they seek specifically?</p>\n\n<p>Understanding who should seek begins with recognizing&nbsp;that Paul&#39;s statement in v.31 is written in the second person plural in the Greek language. In Texas, we say \"you all\" to indicate second person plural. In&nbsp;other words, Paul&#39; command to seek is directed to the collective church body (i.e., second person plural), not to individuals within the body (i.e., second person singular). So as a group, the church body should do the seeking.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, to answer the question what should they seek, remember that the church in Corinth was giving too much attention to the exercise of the gift of tongues&nbsp;at the expense of time spent on other, more important gifts like teaching. The church body was neglecting the expression of teaching, miracles, helps, etc. within the gathering, while spending excessive&nbsp;time seeking to experience speaking in tongues.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Paul says in v.31 that the church body should earnestly desire to receive more of the greater gifts. The church should desire for more teaching, more miracles (like healing), more prayer, more service gifts, etc. in place of seeking for lesser gifts like speaking in tongues. Paul is telling the church to seek earnestly for more nutrition&nbsp;and less junk food.</p>\n\n<p>Paul supports his point with&nbsp;a proof text taken&nbsp;from the Old Testament in Chapter 14:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 14:20 Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature.<br />\n1Cor. 14:21 In the Law it is written, &ldquo;BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME,&rdquo; says the Lord.<br />\n1Cor. 14:22 So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign, not to unbelievers but to those who believe.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>In verse 20, Paul chastises the church for being spiritually immature in their thinking. Their inappropriate desire for&nbsp;the gift of speaking in tongues was evidence of their spiritual immaturity. In fact, Paul goes further and says that if they must be ignorant of something (i.e., if they must be \"infants\"), then be ignorant of evil rather than being ignorant of the proper place for speaking in tongues, which was their situation.</p>\n\n<p>The Corinthian church was ignorant because they were not observing what had been written in the Torah concerning the purpose of speaking in tongues. Paul reminds them that in Deut 28:49 (later repeated in Isaiah 28:11-12) God foretold how one day the Jewish nation would witness a \"strange people\" (i.e., the&nbsp;Gentiles) speaking to God in unfamiliar languages. This event would be a sign to the Jewish people that their Messiah has come, yet God says the Jewish nation wouldn&#39;t heed this sign (i.e., the Jewish people would not receive their Messiah).</p>\n\n<p>Paul uses this text to explain the purpose of speaking in tongues in the Gentile church:&nbsp;it is a sign from the Lord to the unbelieving Jewish people. In verse 22, Paul says speaking in tongues was intended to be a sign to the unbelieving Jew&nbsp;to show that the prophecy in Deuteronomy and Isaiah was being fulfilled in their day. They were being shown in this unique way that the Messiah had come as promised!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, tongues was not a gift given to the Church for the edification of believers (1Cor 14:12).&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">On the contrary, the sign to believers was to be the fulfillment of this prophecy (i.e., the fulfillment of God&#39;s prediction that the Jews would not receive&nbsp;their Messiah). </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, the church in Corinth was acting in ignorance when they overlooked the true purpose of tongues while inventing a different purpose for the gift. Sadly, this church was too preoccupied with their unhealthy fascination with the gift of tongues to take notice of God&#39;s fulfillment of this important scripture.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Conclusion</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>Based on Paul&#39;s teaching in 1Cor 12-14, we learn that the gift of tongues served its prophetic purpose in the first century in fulfilling the Old Testament prophecy, and the gift of speaking in tongues was to diminish in practice except for occasions when an interpreter was present. As Paul wrote, the Spirit will only permit the gift of tongues to be expressed <em>en masse</em> within the church in the presence of unbelieving Jews (which would be very rare today).</p>\n\n<p>Any other mass expression of tongues simply is not a&nbsp;work of the Spirit, since it contradicts scripture. Furthermore, a Christian may express the gift of tongues individually, but they may do so only in private. If they feel led to share their gift in the gathering, they may only do so when an interpreter is present (see 1Cor 14:27-28).</p>\n\n<p>Once a statement in tongues has been spoken, the church body is to wait for interpretation so they may understand the meaning of the word. If no interpretation is offered, then the one speaking in tongues must remain silent since his expression of tongues has failed the Bible&#39;s test and must be considered a false expression (similar to the way all&nbsp;gifts of prophecy must stand a test of accuracy according to 1Cor 14:29).</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that these are God&#39;s purpose in the expression of the gift of tongues, we should take a&nbsp;critical view of&nbsp;any congregation that&nbsp;encourages or allows the&nbsp;routine expression of a (supposed) gift of tongues <em>en masse</em>. If such experiences occur outside the presence of unbelieving Jews (as Paul explained), it is not a true demonstration of tongues. Instead, it is&nbsp;a false, contrived work of the flesh, and it should be avoided by every Christian.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if this experience occurs without an interpreter present, it is further evidence that this expression of tongues is not a work of the Spirit. Lastly, if the church teaches that all Christians can and should speak in tongues, this teaching is false and is not working in the Spirit. Sadly, these mistakes in Corinth continue to occur in many churches worldwide, leading to many fleshly and false rituals without basis in God&#39;s word and at the expense of greater gifts like teaching.</p>\n\n<p>Under these circumstances, we must conclude that any mass expression of speaking in tongues (or an individual expression absent interpretation) is a counterfeit display of faked utterances that have been contrived to create the impression of a gift of tongues. Such demonstrations result from willing participants, motivated by peer pressure, deceived by false teaching and ignorant of the biblical truth, trying to acquire something God has not granted. They force themselves to create meaningless chants, which lack true spiritual power and only serve to impress the flesh.<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Historical Argument</h4>\n\n<p><br />\nBefore the rise of the charismatic movement in the early 20th century, the practice of speaking in tongues was unknown in the church. There is no mention of it in any authoritative church literature after the end of the first century, and no respected church leaders after the Apostolic age ever taught on the continuing use or appearance of this gift. Based on this silence in church literature, it seems the&nbsp;gift disappeared from the body of Christ&nbsp;around the end of the first century (as Paul&#39;s teaching in 1Corinthians 12-14&nbsp;would anticipate).</p>\n\n<p>Mysteriously, on April 14, 1906, in Southern California, something resembling the practice of speaking in tongues re-emerged. Most church historians trace the origins of this practice to a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azusa_Street_Revival\">revival meeting</a> led by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Seymour\">William J. Seymour</a>&nbsp;in the African Methodist Anglican Church. The unorthodox practices of this group included claims of extreme manifestations of the Spirit among the faithful, which continued for several years and were roundly criticized by many respected Christian authorities as unbiblical. Central to&nbsp;these manifestations was an emphasis on&nbsp;speaking in \"tongues.\"</p>\n\n<p>Seymour&#39;s movement, which he linked to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiness_movement\">holiness movement</a>&nbsp;and Pentecostalism of the 19th century, was roundly rejected by his Los Angeles church, which&nbsp;subsequently barred him from further preaching in response to his&nbsp;teaching that true salvation must be accompanied by speaking in tongues. This claim was correctly labeled&nbsp;heresy by his church, and they&nbsp;wisely distanced themselves&nbsp;from his movement.</p>\n\n<p>Despite losing his church, Seymour&nbsp;eventually found a new audience for his false teaching, and this&nbsp;new movement grew by peddling a&nbsp;captivating style of emotional, experiential religion united with a works-based salvation. Under the influence of Seymour&#39;s preaching (and those who followed after him), the new movement made speaking in tongues an essential requirement for&nbsp;salvation.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible clearly teaches that salvation comes by grace alone through faith in Christ alone, and, therefore, speaking in tongues is not a requirement of salvation.</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 10:9 &nbsp; that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and&nbsp; believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 10:10 &nbsp;for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Moreover, if God intended the gift of speaking in tongues to accompany the salvation experience,&nbsp;then how can we explain the fact that speaking in tongues was not practiced in the Church for over 1,900 years before&nbsp;suddenly re-emerged&nbsp;under the teaching of a shady California preacher? This history defies common sense, and it&nbsp;contradicts scripture concerning the establishing of the church and the end of all prophecy.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the&nbsp;origins of speaking in tongues&nbsp;in the modern church give compelling reason to conclude that this behavior is&nbsp;man-made and was triggered by poor&nbsp;teaching&nbsp;rather than by a true movement of the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Pentecostalism Today</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>While the charismatic movement&nbsp;traces its roots to&nbsp;Seymour, Pentecostal churches today hold to a variety of doctrinal views&nbsp;and worship practices, and most Pentecostal churches&nbsp;reject Seymour&#39;s works-based theology and related unbiblical teaching. In fact, today&nbsp;it&#39;s common&nbsp;to find&nbsp;Pentecostal churches teaching salvation by grace through faith alone (i.e., the Gospel) while placing&nbsp;little or no emphasis on speaking in&nbsp;tongues.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, Christians&nbsp;should not assume that all&nbsp;charismatic&nbsp;churches&nbsp;today follow&nbsp;Seymour&#39;s teaching or even hold to a single, uniform set of&nbsp;beliefs and practices. We must&nbsp;be careful to evaluate each charismatic&nbsp;church, in the same way, we examine every&nbsp;other church&nbsp;body: according to what they believe and teach.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">VBVMI&#39;s concern is not with a particular style of worship or with&nbsp;Pentecostalism in general. Rather,&nbsp;we oppose any teaching that distorts the word of God or preaches a Gospel other than the one the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Bible presents.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4><span style=\"line-height: 1.2em;\">Theological Argument</span></h4>\n\n<p><br />\nThe charismatic emphasis on speaking in tongues runs counter to scripture in the way it elevates the role of the Holy Spirit in our Christian experience above an experience with Christ Himself. The charismatic experience is centered on the work of the Holy Spirit. His presence is emphasized, His power is featured, and His glory is sought after. In this \"Spirit-centered\" environment, Christ&#39;s role in His Church is inevitably diminished.</p>\n\n<p>This is exactly opposite to scripture&#39;s teaching concerning the role of the Holy Spirit in the Church and the Godhead. Scripture teaches that the principle role of the Spirit in the Godhead is to testify of Christ and bring Him glory. It is never to bring glory nor attention to Himself (i.e., John 15:26; 16:13-14). Consequently, the Holy Spirit never produces nor participates in any outward manifestation within the Body of Christ which seeks to glorify Himself over Christ. Instead, the primary way we come to know of the work of the Holy Spirit among men is to witness the conviction of sin and a confession of Christ (Acts 2:37-38).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the charismatic culture places this Biblical principle on its head. Implicit in the teaching and practices of this movement is a view that the Spirit should be honored and sought after for His own glory (i.e., leading believers to call upon the Spirit and request His \"filling\"). In such an environment, Christ receives glory only peripherally by association with His Spirit. The Bible, however, teaches that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to be a background role visible only by the way He draws men to the Lord (e.g., John 3:8). In other words, the Spirit&#39;s role is to work invisibly to ensure we glorify Christ.</p>\n\n<p>This pattern is best exemplified in the story of Abraham finding a bride for his son, Isaac in Genesis 24. The Godhead is represented in the story, where Abraham represents the Father, Isaac is the Son, and Rebekka is the Bride of the Son (i.e., the Church). But where is the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is pictured by the nameless servant of Abraham, who travels to Abraham&#39;s ancestral home to select a Bride. The key feature of the story is that the Spirit is never named. His identity remains in the shadows of the story to emphasize how the Spirit works behind the scenes on behalf of the Father and to the glory of the Son.</p>\n\n<p>Based on our Biblical understanding of the Spirit&#39;s role and manner, we can safely say that the Spirit would never participate in any process that resulted in bringing glory to Himself, including speaking in tongues (apart from the narrowly-defined purpose presented in Scripture) or other such manifestations. Rather, the ministry of the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to draw men to Christ and equip the saints to spread the Gospel. As Paul stated, \"Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified.\" (1Cor 1:22-23).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we believe based on scripture, history, and theology that speaking in tongues or similar manifestations are almost always false and man-initiated. In fact, we believe that in many cases such displays are likely the work of the demonic realm, knowing Satan desires to blind unbelievers with false signs and weaken believers by emphasizing personal experience over sound Biblical doctrine.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>The Error of the \"Filling\" of the Holy Spirit</h4>\n\n<p><br />\nThe secondary \"filling\" of the Holy Spirit is another a false teaching arriving out of&nbsp;the charismatic movement. In general two kinds of interpretive errors are responsible for this incorrect teaching.</p>\n\n<p>First, those who teach of a secondary filling by the Spirit commit a logical error in concluding that what is recorded in the scripture concerning&nbsp;the experiences of the early Church are expected to continue for the church indefinitely. The error is in assuming that these early experiences are <em>prescriptive</em> rather than merely <em>descriptive</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The misunderstanding comes primarily from various passages in Acts that describe the ministry of the Holy Spirit during the early Church. In the earliest days of the Church, men occasionally came to a saving faith in Christ without an immediate indwelling of the Spirit. When the Spirit arrived at a later, appointed time, these believers&nbsp;experienced an outward manifestation of the Spirit&#39;s indwelling (i.e., speaking in tongues or other supernatural manifestation).</p>\n\n<p>This experience was uncommon in the early church. It happens in only three occurrences for specific reasons, which are described in detail in our <a href=\"/bible-studies/acts_of_the_apostles\">Acts study</a>. Apart from this three examples, all other believers receive the Holy Spirit at the moment of faith. Scripture never teaches that all believers should expect a subsequent \"filling\" experience by the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Today as then, a believer is indwelled by the Holy Spirit at the point of faith, and there is no expectation for an additional \"filling\" or manifestation of the Spirit to follow. Instead, the normative experience for Christians since the first century has been to see the Holy Spirit manifest His presence only through the fruit of the Spirit and the giving of spiritual gifts (Gal 5:22).</p>\n\n<p>Those who teach a secondary filling of the Spirit after conversion&nbsp;are making a false assumption &ndash; built on faulty logic and without support in scripture &ndash; that happened in a few limited cases must be the norm for every believer. They make the mistake of taking descriptions of events in scripture and applying them prescriptively for all believers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As believers, we can&#39;t arrive at our doctrinal beliefs by presuming what God may do apart from His word <em>says</em> He will do. For example, using the same logic employed by those who teach a secondary filling of the Spirit, we could assert that because God once caused a donkey to speak in Numbers 22 that we should expect the Lord&nbsp;to make donkeys speak routinely. Obviously, such a conclusion is&nbsp;nonsense, and yet it follows naturally&nbsp;from the same logic&nbsp;that concluded&nbsp;all Christians must experience what happened to a few believers in the early church.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, the early church experienced many unique practices. It had the benefit of the apostles&#39; testimony and leadership, and it had the burden of establishing the truth of the Gospel among a skeptical population that had never experienced the New Testament faith. The apostles had to win over their first converts from three different groups (Jews, Samaritans, and Gentiles) that each had some prior (and incorrect) understanding of God&#39;s plan of redemption.</p>\n\n<p>These challenges led God to make special accommodations for the Church using supernatural manifestations. The supernatural manifestations of the Holy Spirit were powerful and essential tools to validate the message of the Gospel and the authority of the apostles&nbsp;during the establishment of the early church. The supernatural manifestations also validated and distinguished the true church and true apostles from those who might try to counterfeit or distort the Gospel during its early days.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, this erroneous teaching&nbsp;comes from an error in the interpretation of&nbsp;the Greek word <em>pleroo</em>.&nbsp;When used in scripture, the word means to be made full or amply supplied. It does not usually mean to \"fill up.\" As an example, Paul says in Phil 4:18 \"And my God will supply (<em>pleroo</em>) all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.\" As the word implies in this verse, God isn&#39;t \"filling up\" our needs but rather He is meeting our needs fully. This is the proper understanding of the word.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, those teaching the necessity of a&nbsp;secondary filling of the Spirit&nbsp;have misappropriated this word to suit their own purposes by claiming that the word describes a greater giving of the Holy Spirit, particularly in often-quoted passages like:</p>\n\n<h6>Eph. 5:18: \"And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit.\"<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>As with the earlier verse from Philippians, the \"filling\" here refers not to a greater <em>measure</em> of the Spirit but a greater <em>reliance</em> on the Spirit as He already lives in us.</p>\n\n<p>To suggest that there is \"more\" of the Spirit available to any believer defies the Biblical portrayal of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a single entity, without division or measure. Consequently, all Christians receive the entire Holy Spirit. There is nothing less than the whole Spirit available to all believers from the moment of faith.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, a believer can be more or less in submission to the Spirit in their daily walk. This is the purpose of the command that we \"be filled by the Holy Spirit.\" Paul meant that the believer should be completely reliant upon and obedient to the Spirit. He was not teaching&nbsp;that believers need&nbsp;some additional \"filling\" of the Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the&nbsp;teachings of a subsequent filling of the Holy Spirit accompanied by speaking in tongues are unbiblical and built upon a poor interpretation of scripture and faulty logic. They are an impediment to spiritual growth &ndash; not a means to it &ndash; and they have served to divide the Body and confuse believers for the past 100 years.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Additional Thoughts and Conclusions</h4>\n\n<p><br />\nWe believe the gift of speaking in tongues can exist in the body of Christ today, but only as the Bible provides. Though all gifts of the tongue will cease in the future&nbsp;(1Cor 13:8), Paul&#39;s comments in 1Corinthians 13-15 leave open the possibility that speaking in tongues can happen in the church today. In these cases, Paul sets specific expectations for when and how this gift will be prompted by the Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>As we taught above, in a corporate setting the Spirit will only prompt the gift of tongues to be manifested for the sake of a sign to unbelieving Jews who are present in the gathering (1Cor 14:21-22). If no unbelieving Jews are present in the gathering, then the gift of tongues will never be prompted <em>en masse </em>by the Spirit, since we know the Spirit would never lead the believer to act in a way contrary to God&#39;s word.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we believe that speaking in tongues may occur privately during individual time of prayer and private worship. Some refer to this private expression of tongues as an individual prayer language. The person speaking tongues in this way would not understand his or her words of praise or prayer, but God would receive them nonetheless because the words were prompted by the Spirit. However, this gift is not a universal gift for all Christians (no gift is universal), and it cannot be expressed in a corporate gathering for the reasons mentioned already.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we shouldn&#39;t confuse speaking in tongues with praying in the Spirit. Praying in the Spirit is a phrase that means praying in the will of the Spirit or under the guidance of the Spirit. The phrase does not mean praying in a foreign tongue. The two verses that make this statement (i.e.,&nbsp;Jude 20 and Eph 6:18) are speaking about praying under the guidance of the Spirit, not praying in a foreign tongue.</p>\n\n<p>All Christians are called to pray in the Spirit because we are all called to pray according to God&#39;s will and by His Spirit (Matt 6:10). Paul also describes praying according to the will of the Spirit in Rom 8:26-27:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 8:26 In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words;<br />\nRom. 8:27 and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Notice that Paul says that when we don&#39;t know what to pray, the Spirit intercedes for us according to God&#39;s will, but He does so WITHOUT words. Paul is not teaching that the Spirit produces foreign words, but rather His intercession takes places without words because He intercedes on our behalf. Paul is teaching that our needs are before God even when we don&#39;t know how to express them since the Spirit is always at work directing our prayer life according to God&#39;s will. Jesus echoes this thought in Matt 6:8:</p>\n\n<h6>Matt 6:8 &nbsp;So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>So, praying in the Spirit does not mean speaking in tongues. All Christians are expected to pray under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, but only a few Christians will have the gift of speaking in tongues.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. How did fallen angels impregnate women and make Nephalim? And, why did they do this?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA. In Genesis 6 we learn that the primary cause of the flood was the emergence of a new, insidious threat to God&#39;s plan of redemption. Fallen angels,&nbsp;called \"sons of God\" (ben Elohim)&nbsp;in Genesis 6,&nbsp;were taking women,&nbsp;called \"daughters of men,\"&nbsp;for sexual relationships. The result of these unions were a groteque being scripture calls&nbsp;Nephilim. The Nephilim were giants, people who were grossly distorted by their unnatural origins.</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 6:1 Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them,<br />\nGen. 6:2 that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were&nbsp; beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Gen. 6:4 The&nbsp; Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Satan instigated this plan hoping to polute&nbsp;the human \"seed\" to&nbsp;stop God&#39;s plan&nbsp;to bring forth a Messiah, the Seed,&nbsp;promised to come one day and destroy (i.e., bruise) Satan:</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 3:15: &nbsp;And I will put&nbsp;enmity<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Between you and the woman,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And between your seed and her seed;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">He shall&nbsp;bruise you on the head,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And you shall bruise him on the heel.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<p><br />\nClearly, the Lord could not stand by and allow such an attempt to succeed. Peter also refers to this occasion in his second letter in explaining the Lord&#39;s response:</p>\n\n<h5>2Pet. 2:4&nbsp; For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and&nbsp; committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment;<br />\n2Pet. 2:5 and did not spare&nbsp; the ancient world, but preserved&nbsp; Noah, a&nbsp; preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a&nbsp; flood upon the world of the ungodly;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The Lord punished the demons and destroyed the&nbsp;fruit of their evil labors. Clearly, the act of mating happened, and the&nbsp;demons involved in this sin paid a dear price, but apart from these references, we have little to help us understand how spiritual creatures can mate with physical beings. We do not know specifically how the demons impregnated women, but we do know of other circumstances when angels appear to men in the form of bodies. For example, Abraham is met by three \"men\" in Genesis 18:</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 18:2 When he lifted up his eyes and looked, behold, three&nbsp; men were standing opposite him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Later in the chapter, we observe these men eating with Abraham and speaking with him, yet they were not men. One was the Lord Himself and the other two were angels. So clearly, angels can take the form of men when desired.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we know that the Holy Spirit impregnated Mary. While we&#39;re not suggesting that demons&#39; abilities are equal to God&#39;s, nevertheless it demonstrates that Spirit and flesh can interact in ways we don&#39;t completely understand.</p>\n\n<p>So although&nbsp;the details are not provided for us, scripture testifies that demons and women mated in some way to produce a race of creatures called Nephalim.</p>\n\n<p>You may also enjoy the following article:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/did_the_ten_spies_actually_lie\">How did the ten spies see Nephilim after the Flood?</a></p>"

Every Christian entertains sinful thoughts and behaves in sinful ways on a regular basis, for such is the condition of our flesh, but these thoughts and actions do not disqualify us from Heaven. We are required to repent as a part of our salvation moment, but repentance on a continual basis is not the basis for our entry to Heaven.</p>\n\n<p>First, if we say continual confession of sin is required to ensure our salvation, then we are saying that salvation is conditional on works (i.e., the work of continual confession).

Consider what would happen to any Christian who utters a curse word or entertains a sinful thought in the moment before they die in a sudden car crash or of a heart attack?

How could any of us feel secure in our salvation if Heaven were entirely dependent on the good timing of our&nbsp;death?</p>\n\n<p>If we believe a Christian who commits suicide dies without hope of Heaven, then we must conclude that most (if not all) Christians have likewise lost the promise of eternal life because they too will have failed to repent of a specific sin before they died. If continuous confession of sin is a requirement for salvation, then every&nbsp;Christian lives in constant jeopardy.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, God has provided a more powerful salvation that is by grace alone and not by works.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Though we may die with some unconfessed sin,&nbsp;nevertheless we&nbsp;still&nbsp;enter into Heaven because our salvation is based on receiving&nbsp;Christ&#39;s righteousness&nbsp;and not based on our own perfection.&nbsp;We can know this is true by studying what the Bible says about our sin and the nature of our salvation.</span></p>\n\n<p>For example, you correctly stated that sin cannot enter heaven, but the Bible says all men have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Therefore, God must remove our sin and give us His righteousness if we are to enter Heaven. Without the righteousness of God, we would have no hope.&nbsp;By faith, the Father assigns Christ&#39;s righteousness to us. His sinlessness is awarded to us on the basis of faith alone, so we acquire the perfection required to enter Heaven based on Christ&#39;s perfection and not our own.</p>\n\n<p>Christ also paid the penalty for our sin when He died in our place on the cross. So, a great exchange takes place. Christ takes our sin on the cross, while we receive His righteousness as a gift. As Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 5:21 He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Phil. 3:9 and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ,&nbsp; the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So our entrance into Heaven is made possible solely on the basis of our faith in Christ&#39;s death and resurrection, which brings us Christ&#39;s righteousness.</p>\n\n<p>How does repentance factor into our salvation? The Bible calls on all people to repent and believe in order to receive this gift of eternal life, but the repentance the Bible is speaking about is a one-time turning from dead works and turning toward Christ in faith, as Hebrews says:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 6:1&nbsp; Therefore leaving the&nbsp; elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from&nbsp; dead works and of faith toward God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The repentance to obtain eternal life does NOT mean repenting of each and every individual sin in our lives. Eternal life does not depend on listing out our sins and confessing each one in turn. Every Christian has literally thousands of unconfessed sins, and we have probably forgotten far more sin than we could ever remember, much less confess! &nbsp;Simply put, such a behavior isn&#39;t even possible must less required for salvation.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the repentance that leads to eternal life is an unique kind of repentance.&nbsp;Our one-time moment of repenting of our life of dead works and accepting Jesus Christ&nbsp;saves us for all time by bninging us&nbsp;Christ&#39;s righteousness.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">From the point of our confession in faith, every Christian is assured Heaven, because we have Christ&#39;s righteousness and no amount of sin can exceed the grace of God. Simply put, we can&#39;t sin our way out of God&#39;s grace and mercy once we have been clothed in His righteousness.</span></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, repenting and confessing every sin in our daily lives is not a prerequisite for entering Heaven. Again, if such a requirement existed, then no Christian could ever enter Heaven, for we all live with unconfessed sins everyday of our lives.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">(To learn more about the role of repentance in the life of a believer, we encourage you to read our article:&nbsp;</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/do_christians_need_to_continue_asking_for_forgiveness/\">Do Christians need to ask for forgiveness?</a></strong>)</em></p>\n\n<p>A true Christian who commits suicide will still enter Heaven, because this person was saved at the point of their confession of Christ, and no sin can ever separate a Christian from the love of God, not even the sin of <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/can_a_christian_commit_suicide/\">self-murder</a></strong>.

But if&nbsp; when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds&nbsp; favor with God.<br />\n1Pet. 2:21 For&nbsp; you have been called for this purpose,&nbsp; since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you&nbsp; an example for you to follow in His steps,<br />\n1Pet. 2:22 WHO&nbsp; COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH;<br />\n1Pet. 2:23&nbsp; and while being&nbsp; reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously;<br />\n1Pet. 2:24 and He Himself&nbsp;&nbsp; bore our sins in His body on the&nbsp;&nbsp; cross, so that we&nbsp; might die to&nbsp; sin and live to righteousness; for&nbsp; by His&nbsp; wounds you were&nbsp; healed.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Though Peter is speaking about slaves and masters, his teaching also sheds light on&nbsp;employer-employee relationships.

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. Can Satan perform miracles and if so by what and whose power? I thought the Bible teaches that Jesus stripped him of all his power?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Satan can perform \"miracles\" in the sense that he has power to manifest supernatural wonders and signs. The power of the enemy is often called the \"dark arts\" or sorcery. We find examples of it in many places in both the Old and New Testaments:</p>\n\n<h5>Ex. 7:8&nbsp; Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,<br />\nEx. 7:9 &ldquo;When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, &lsquo;&nbsp; Work a miracle,&rsquo; then you shall say to Aaron, &lsquo; Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />\nEx. 7:10 So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and thus they did just as the LORD had commanded; and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and&nbsp; his servants, and it&nbsp; became a serpent.<br />\nEx. 7:11 Then Pharaoh also&nbsp; called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the&nbsp;&nbsp; magicians of Egypt, did&nbsp; the same with&nbsp; their secret arts.<br />\nEx. 7:12 For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents. But Aaron&rsquo;s staff swallowed up their staffs.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Mark 13:21 &ldquo;And then if anyone says to you, &lsquo;Behold, here is&nbsp; the Christ&rsquo;; or, &lsquo;Behold, He is there&rsquo;; do not believe him;<br />\nMark 13:22 for false Christs and&nbsp; false prophets will arise, and will show&nbsp;&nbsp; signs and&nbsp; wonders, in order to lead astray, if possible, the elect.<br />\nMark 13:23 &ldquo;But take heed; behold, I have told you everything in advance.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice how in the past the demonic realm commanded power over physical elements, though their power was not greater than the power of God. Also notice that Jesus taught that in the future we should expect to see the demonic realm performing great miracles and signs, which will lead astray many. This is further evidence that the demonic realm still has power to perform miracles.</p>\n\n<p>You can learn more about Satan&#39;s power to perform miracles by listening to the following lessons from our Exodus and Genesis studies:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/resource_library/bible_studies/genesis_2011/genesis_2011_lesson_41b/\">Genesis Lesson 41B</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/resource_library/bible_studies/exodus/exodus_lesson_24/\">Exodus Lesson 24</a></p>\n\n<p>You commented that \"Jesus stripped Satan of his power,\" but that statement isn&#39;t an accurate summary of what the Bible teaches. Specifically, the Bible says:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 2:14&nbsp; Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless&nbsp; him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,<br />\nHeb. 2:15 and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The Bible says that Christ&#39;s work of redemption by His death rendered Satan powerless over our death. As Christians, we no longer have reason to fear death. Jesus rendered Satan powerless to condemn us and to enslave us by our fear of death and judgment. On the other hand, the Bible does NOT say that Jesus eliminated Satan&#39;s power.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, the Bible warns believers not to underestimate Satan&#39;s power to ensnare us:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 3:4 [An elder] must be one who&nbsp; manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity<br />\n1Tim. 3:5 (but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of&nbsp; the church of God?),<br />\n1Tim. 3:6 and not a new convert, so that he will not become&nbsp; conceited and fall into the&nbsp; condemnation&nbsp; incurred by the devil.<br />\n1Tim. 3:7 And he must&nbsp; have a good reputation with&nbsp; those outside the church, so that he will not fall into reproach and&nbsp; the snare of the devil.</h5>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 5:8&nbsp; Be of sober spirit,&nbsp; be on the alert. Your adversary,&nbsp; the devil, prowls around like a roaring&nbsp; lion, seeking someone to devour.<br />\n1Pet. 5:9&nbsp;&nbsp; But resist him,&nbsp; firm in your faith, knowing that&nbsp; the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your&nbsp; brethren who are in the world.</h5>\n\n<h5>Eph. 6:11&nbsp; Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the&nbsp; schemes of the devil.<br />\nEph. 6:12 For our&nbsp; struggle is not against&nbsp;&nbsp; flesh and blood, but&nbsp; against the rulers, against the powers, against the&nbsp; world forces of this&nbsp; darkness, against the&nbsp; spiritual forces of wickedness in&nbsp; the heavenly places.<br />\nEph. 6:13 Therefore, take up&nbsp; the full armor of God, so that you will be able to&nbsp; resist in&nbsp; the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Bible repeated instructs believers not to underestimate the power of the enemy nor discount the craftiness of his schemes. In fact, even angels show consideration for the power of the enemy:</p>\n\n<h5>Jude 8&nbsp; Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming,&nbsp; defile the flesh, and reject authority, and revile&nbsp; angelic majesties.<br />\nJude 9 &nbsp;But Michael&nbsp; the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about&nbsp; the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, &ldquo; The Lord rebuke you!&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nClearly, the enemy has power that even the archangel Michael respected. He declared that the Lord would rebuke the devil. So we have good reason to give the enemy his due, even as we understand that the Lord has taken away the enemy&#39;s power over our death. Therefore, we may acknowledge the enemy&#39;s power and remain diligent against his schemes, while having no fear of him and remaining confident in the Lord&#39;s eventual triumph.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>One day the Lord will destroy the enemy:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 20:10 And&nbsp; the devil who&nbsp; deceived them was thrown into the&nbsp; lake of fire and&nbsp; brimstone, where the&nbsp; beast and the&nbsp; false prophet are also; and they will be&nbsp; tormented day and night forever and ever.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>"

Some churches accept homosexuals while other churches condemn gay people.&nbsp;What does the Bible teach? Is it&nbsp;possible to be both a Christian and a homosexual?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Few topics today generate more controversy, emotion and confusion in the church (and in society) than the issue of homosexuality. Many Christians have become hesitant (and even fearful) to defend a Biblical view of sexuality in the face of growing persecution from homosexual advocates. In virtually every nation around the world, same-sex relationships have acquired legitimacy and acceptability to an extent virtually unthinkable just a few decades ago.</span></p>\n\n<p>In many Western nations, homosexual marriage is now legal, and even where homosexual marriage remains against the law, homosexual couples may still enjoy many of the same parental and other legal rights as natural marriages. In the United States, acceptance of homosexuality is also growing fast with the Supreme Court recently mandating homosexual marriage in all fifty states.</p>\n\n<p>The same shifting winds of opinion have led many churches to accept openly homosexual members, and some congregations has begun to sanctify homosexual marriages while others no longer teach that homosexual acts are sinful or unnatural.<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;In fact, in some \"churches\"&nbsp;homosexuals can assume leadership positions&nbsp;enjoying the full acceptance and encouragement of church members without shame or reproach.</span></p>\n\n<p>As society and the Church become increasingly comfortable with homosexuality, persecution will undoubtedly increase against those who hold a contrary viewpoint. Many within the church who hold to the traditional view of homosexuality as sin are labeled bigots, extremists and worse. Some nations have passed laws classifying condemnation of homosexuals as \"hate speech,\" and some pastors risk imprisonment for speaking out against the practice.</p>\n\n<p>Though the fight over homosexuality in our culture has moved to the front pages in recent decades, homosexual behavior has always been a part of human society. Ancient records and the Bible stories reflect its longevity in society, including accounts like Sodom and Gomorrah</p>\n\n<p>While most cultures condemned the practice, some cultures celebrated it. Historical accounts record that men in both the Greek and the Roman cultures practiced homosexuality routinely (although it&#39;s unclear how pervasive the practices were in the culture overall). Many of the emperors of Rome reportedly engaged in homosexual behavior, and ancient temples often featured male prostitutes for that reason. So while homosexuality has only recently emerged from the shadows in our culture, the practice has always flourished somewhere, whether underground or in full view.</p>\n\n<p>So how should a Christian view homosexual behavior, and how do we make sense of society&#39;s increasing acceptance of the behavior? What can we say to friends or family who practice homosexual behavior? Finally, what are we to conclude about a person professing faith in Christ while willfully embracing and enjoying a homosexual lifestyle?<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Homosexuality Defined<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>First, let&#39;s consider a brief history of the term \"homosexual.\" In ancient cultures, the act itself did not have a unique name and neither did the person who practiced it. For example, there is no Hebrew word in the Old Testament for homosexual. Instead, the Old Testament simply describes the act itself, referring to it as \"laying with a male as one lies with a female\" while calling such an act an abomination, which means it is detestable to God. For example:</p>\n\n<h5>Lev. 18:21&nbsp; &lsquo;You shall not give any of your offspring to them to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am the LORD.<br />\nLev. 18:22&nbsp; &lsquo;You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.<br />\nLev. 18:23&nbsp; &lsquo;Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>(We should note how the Lord condemns homosexual acts in the same context as prohibiting child sacrifice and bestiality. Clearly, the Lord holds the practice in great contempt.)</p>\n\n<p>Later after the Lord judged Sodom and Gomorrah for their sexual perversion and wickedness, the names of the cities became associated with homosexual behavior, and so the term \"sodomite\" came to stand for one who practices homosexual behavior. The term didn&#39;t convey an identity or suggest a lifestyle; it simply described a person who engaged in depraved sexual behavior.</p>\n\n<p>In the same way that \"murderer\" describes someone who murders a human being unlawfully, \"sodomite\" described a person who practiced sodomy. The term was not a compliment, of course, and sodomites did not unite to demand acceptance within society (no more than murderers requested the same privilege). In all but a few places (e.g., Sodom), sodomites were&nbsp;outcasts within society.</p>\n\n<p>Sodomy remained the most common term for&nbsp;homosexual behavior until the present-day term first appeared in the middle of the 19th century, eventually becoming the preferred name by the early 20th century. This change in terminology was not accidental. It came about as part of a campaign orchestrated by homosexuality sympathizers in medicine, psychology, the media, the entertainment industry and anti-religious groups to legitimize the behavior within the culture.</p>\n\n<p>Proponents hoped the term \"homosexual\" would invite comparisons to heterosexual, thereby suggesting it was an equally healthy and acceptable alternative, and the effort picked up steam in the 1960s. By the end of the 20th century, homosexual behavior was broadly celebrated (at least by liberal-leaning elements of society)&nbsp;rather than condemned, and those who engage in a lifestyle of&nbsp;homosexuality&nbsp;began to be courted rather than ostracized.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>The Bible&#39;s Teaching on Homosexuality<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>What does the Bible say about this practice? As we saw earlier, the Law clearly condemns homosexual behavior, requiring death for any in Israel who practices it.&nbsp; While Christians are not bound to apply the penalties of the Old Testament Law, the New Testament echoes the Law&#39;s strong words against the practice. For example:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 1:22&nbsp; Professing to be wise, they became fools,<br />\nRom. 1:23&nbsp; and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and&nbsp; crawling creatures.<br />\nRom. 1:24&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp; God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be&nbsp; dishonored among them.<br />\nRom. 1:25&nbsp; For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator,&nbsp; who is blessed&nbsp; forever. Amen.<br />\nRom. 1:26&nbsp; For this reason&nbsp; God gave them over to&nbsp; degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is&nbsp; unnatural,<br />\nRom. 1:27&nbsp; and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.</h5>\n\n<h5><br />\n1Cor. 6:9&nbsp; Or&nbsp; do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?&nbsp; Do not be deceived;&nbsp; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor&nbsp; effeminate, nor homosexuals,<br />\n1Cor. 6:10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will&nbsp; inherit the kingdom of God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 1:8&nbsp; But we know that&nbsp; the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,<br />\n1Tim. 1:9&nbsp; realizing the fact that&nbsp; law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the&nbsp; ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers<br />\n1Tim. 1:10&nbsp; and immoral men&nbsp; and&nbsp; homosexuals&nbsp; and&nbsp; kidnappers&nbsp; and&nbsp; liars&nbsp; and&nbsp; perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to&nbsp; sound teaching,<br />\n1Tim. 1:11&nbsp; according to&nbsp; the glorious gospel of&nbsp; the blessed God, with which I have been&nbsp; entrusted.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nLet&#39;s consider these three passages in turn. First, in Romans 1 Paul describes the progression into ungodliness experienced by natural men. First, men became prideful thinking themselves wise without God&#39;s counsel (v.22). Their foolishness then led them to worship the creation rather than the Creator (v.23). As a result, the Lord judged them by handing them over to their fleshly desires. The Lord allowed the sinful flesh of men to gain full control over their instincts and desires, leading them astray into greater and greater depravity.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, their increasing depravity resulted in men dishonoring their own bodies (vs.24-25). In a sense, Paul says ungodly men became the victims of their own crimes, as they participate in homosexual behavior. In describing the behavior, Paul uses the term \"arsenokoites,\" which is the Greek word for sodomite, though our modern English Bibles have chosen to translate this Greek word as homosexual instead.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s important to notice that Paul says both men and women \"exchanged\" the natural for the unnatural and \"abandoned\" the natural to seek the unnatural. The word of God makes clear that homosexual behavior is an unnatural act that replaces a natural sexual act God has prescribed. Despite popular teaching to the contrary, there is nothing natural or normal about homosexual behavior, according to the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Paul describes homosexual acts as indecent and an \"error.\" When the flesh \"burns\" for something it shouldn&#39;t have, Paul says, it is indecent, and this error will lead to a penalty. The penalty begins in their \"own persons\" (v.27), which is a reference to the degrading and harmful physical effects of homosexual behavior. The penalties don&#39;t end with the physical, however, as God is prepared to visit a much greater penalty upon them in eternity.</p>\n\n<p>In the second passage taken from 1Corinthians, Paul declared that the \"unrighteous\" will not inherit the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom refers to the Millennial Kingdom the Lord will establish on Earth and into which all saints will enter by faith in Jesus Christ. To be unrighteous in this context, therefore, means failing to trust in Christ for salvation. The person is unsaved by their lack of faith, and therefore the homosexual behavior is a reflection of an unbelieving heart.</p>\n\n<p>Paul says to the Church do not be deceived by these people. Do not assume that the practice of such behavior is compatible with the righteousness which is by faith. Paul says the righteousness which is by faith will move us away from a lifestyle of persistent sin, whether the sin of fornication, idolatry, adultery, homosexuality, etc. Therefore, we are not to be deceived by those who claim that Christian life and persistent sin are compatible. They are not.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Paul is NOT suggesting that a Christian will never sin in these ways or that such sins \"disqualify\" a Christian from the Kingdom. All true Christians are saved by faith alone, and no sin can separate a believer from the love of God (see Rom 8:38-39). Sadly, some Christians do commit these sins from time to time, but Paul is warning about a very different problem. He is concerned with believers embracing the lie that says Christian belief and practice may coexist with a lifestyle of sin in any form. Paul says do not be deceived by such ungodliness.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, persistent homosexual behavior is powerful evidence that the person may never have been born again, despite claims to the contrary. At the very least, anyone claiming to be a believer while living the homosexual lifestyle is a source of great harm to the church body&nbsp;and should be held under church discipline.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Paul&#39;s third passage from 1Timothy refutes any teaching that homosexuality is compatible with Christianity. Notice Paul says these behaviors (including homosexuality) are contrary to sound teaching (v.11), and, therefore, the Law stands ready to rebuke&nbsp;such sinful practices. Anyone who teaches that homosexuality is compatible with Christianity is not teaching sound doctrine, according to the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>The Law of God is aimed at the rebels and the ungodly, so that it may convict hearts by presenting God&#39;s unchanging&nbsp;standards for holiness. The Bible cites acts&nbsp;of killing parents, kidnapping, lying, perjuring or homosexuality as&nbsp;examples contrary to the will and instructions of God, Paul says, and they are incompatible with Christian living and belief.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Bible leaves no&nbsp;doubt that homosexuality is ungodly and contrary to the natural order of God&#39;s creation, and, therefore, it is impossible to harmonize homosexual behavior with a lifestyle of following Christ.&nbsp;Homosexuality is an unnatural choice, according to scripture, and no matter how commonplace or accepted the practice may become&nbsp;within our culture, the act will always be morally wrong according to God, Who is our Judge.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As both Peter and Jude sum&nbsp;up, homosexuality is \"gross immorality\" in God&#39;s eyes, and cultures that have embraced in the past have experienced God&#39;s judgment for it:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Jude 7 just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>2Pet. 2:6 and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly lives thereafter;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Pet. 2:7 and if He rescued righteous Lot, oppressed by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Pet. 2:8 (for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds),&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Pet. 2:9 then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Pet. 2:10 and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority.&nbsp;</span></h5>\n\n<h4><br />\n<br />\nAre&nbsp;Homosexuality Thoughts and Desires Natural?<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>The Bible clearly teaches that homosexuality acts are always wrong, but as Christians seeking to win a lost world to Christ, we must differentiate between those who experience homosexual temptations from those who choose to engage in homosexual behaviors. Any person (even a Christian) may experience lustful attraction for someone of the same sex from time to time. When we turn away from our&nbsp;temptations, we do not sin, according to the scriptures.&nbsp;The Bible exhorts all believers to resist temptation so that we might be holy as our Father in Heaven is holy.</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, some people are born with a greater tendency for the temptation to&nbsp;homosexual sin just as other people are prone to temptation&nbsp;by other&nbsp;sins like lying, violence, stealing, etc. Nevertheless,&nbsp;the fact that a homosexual desire&nbsp;is present from birth doesn&#39;t legitimize the sin, no&nbsp;more than we would excuse the sin of&nbsp;someone who possessed&nbsp;a&nbsp;proclivity from birth to steal or lie.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, the argument that homosexuals cannot help themselves because they were born with homosexual desires is&nbsp;neither a novel nor compelling defense. T</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">he&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Bible agrees with them! Scripture teaches that <strong><em>all</em></strong> sin is present from birth, and as a result scripture commands us to flee <em>youthful</em> lusts (2Tim 2:22) precisely&nbsp;because&nbsp;all sin&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">originates at birth. The fact that </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">a particular sinful desire</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;(like homosexual lust) began early in life doesn&#39;t make it good or healthy. Rather, it merely confirms Romans 3, which teaches:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 3:10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;as it is written,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 3:11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 3:12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD,</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In that way, we can say that&nbsp;homosexual lust and heterosexual lust are the same&nbsp;in that every man and woman will experience&nbsp;inappropriate sexual desires from time to time. No one is unique in that regard, and, therefore, we can no more give license for someone to act&nbsp;out on homosexual lust than we can for heterosexual lust. Said another way, if the Church declares acts of homosexual lust are legitimate (in violation of&nbsp;the clear teaching of scripture),&nbsp;then it must&nbsp;also legitimize heterosexual lust as well. Obviously, all lust is sin and all lust must be resisted.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In summary, the Bible teaches that the only form of sexual intimacy permitted by God is found </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">in the context of a marriage between a man and woman. Christians experiencing&nbsp;homosexual or heterosexual lust need our encouragement to resist such temptations to sin, and we do them no favors when we condone or encourage their sinful choices.</span></p>\n\n<h4><br />\nSpeaking Truth in Love<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>So how should a Christian confront someone who practices (or approves of) homosexuality? The answer depends on whether we are speaking with an unbeliever (non-Christian)&nbsp;or a born-again believer.</p>\n\n<p>If the person is an unbeliever, we must take the conversation in a different direction. Rather than debating the merits of homosexuality, we should make our goal presenting the Gospel. Saving the soul is infinitely more important than conforming a person to the lifestyle of a Christian.&nbsp;Seeking to change someone&#39;s opinion concerning a sinful act&nbsp;without addressing the underlying spiritual cause for the sin is like putting lipstick on a pig. Even if the&nbsp;person agreed with our arguments, the person&nbsp;would still be a lost sinner subject to God&#39;s wrath in the day of judgment. What have we achieved?</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if we present the Gospel and the person hears it and comes to faith in Christ, then they will be forgiven by God&nbsp;of all sin. Moreover, they will&nbsp;receive the Holy Spirit, Who will bring conviction of sin and the power to free them from slavery to sin, including homosexuality. This is the Lord&#39;s blessing for all believers:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 6:11 Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.<br />\nRom. 6:12 Therefore do not let sin&nbsp; reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts,<br />\nRom. 6:13 and do not go on&nbsp; presenting&nbsp; the members of your body to sin as&nbsp; instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as&nbsp; instruments of righteousness to God.<br />\nRom. 6:14 For&nbsp; sin shall not&nbsp; be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nTrue conversion to faith in Christ is a person&#39;s only hope both for obtaining forgiveness and the power to live a godly life, which is the real goal of our witnessing as Christians. As you present the Gospel, you may also find an opportunity to declare the Biblical truth concerning homosexuality. The key is to speak this truth in love while allowing the conviction of the Spirit to work in the heart.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus serves as our role model in this approach. In John 4, Jesus encountered an adulterous woman at a well, and in the course of their discussion, Jesus candidly pointed out her sinful lifestyle even as He called her to repent and believe in Him. Ultimately, she came to faith in Christ and spread the news to her town.</p>\n\n<p>Though Jesus boldly pointed out her sin, nevertheless He also offered her the chance for forgiveness, thereby demonstrating God&#39;s love for her in the process. Today, Jesus offers the same forgiveness to homosexuals through the appeal we make on His behalf as His ambassadors sent with the Gospel. Therefore, endeavor to approach your circumstances in a similar manner, preaching the truth of the Gospel in love, while calling for repentance of sin and belief in Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if a practicing homosexual&nbsp;claims to be a born-again Christian, we should approach the conversation very differently.&nbsp;The Bible gives us very clear instructions for how to proceed, warning us not to be deceived by anyone claiming that willful sinful is compatible with a Christian walk. Instead, we are to separate ourselves entirely from their influence within the Church:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 5:11 But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or&nbsp; an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler &mdash; not even to eat with such a one.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nPaul says unequivocally we are not to associate in any way with a believer who practices an immoral lifestyle. A Christian is not even permitted to share a dinner table with such a person!&nbsp; Also, notice Paul calls these people \"so-called\" brothers, reflecting his doubts over their profession of faith. Perhaps such people are true believers, but as Paul reminds us, there is also a good chance they are not. Regardless, we distance ourselves from them because they claim a faith they aren&#39;t living out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Paul&#39;s instructions yield&nbsp;two important and necessary safeguards for the body of Christ. First, separating from the disobedient Christian demonstrates to all rebellious believers that sinful choices will not be tolerated (much less condoned) by fellow believers. Fellowship within the body of Christ is a privilege that depends upon obedience to God&#39;s word. Those who depart from sound teaching are to be set outside fellowship as an&nbsp;example and incentive to others to remain obedient to God&#39;s word.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Paul&#39;s warning&nbsp;protects the church from counterfeit Christians, who infiltrate the body and corrupt it from within. The \"so-called\" brother or sister is no brother or sister at all, and therefore he or she is a slave to sin and unable to confirm to godliness. He or she must be set apart from the body to ensure the enemy has no opportunity to corrupt God&#39;s people by their influence. As Paul taught:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 6:14&nbsp; Do not be bound together with&nbsp; unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?<br />\n2Cor. 6:15&nbsp; Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nSo whether the person is a true believer in rebellion to God or an unbeliever posing as a Christian, in either case they must be set outside fellowship to protect the flock from their harmful influence. While the world may label our response as \"hate speech\" or \"homophobia,\" the truth is far different. We are acting in love for the body of Christ and for the offending individual by making opportunity available for repentance and restoration, which brings eternal reward. More importantly, we are living in obedience to the Lord, Who calls us to obey His word and accept whatever consequences may follow.</p>\n\n<h4><br />\nPracticing Truth in Love<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>In any conflict with those advocating homosexuality, a Christian&nbsp;should never resort to using&nbsp;angry rhetoric, hurtful epithets or displaying unloving attitudes toward anyone. Remember, the Bible typically addresses homosexual behavior in the context of other sins like murder, lying, adultery, etc., therefore we shouldn&#39;t single out the practice of homosexuality for harsher treatment.&nbsp;All sin is equally wrong, and all sinners are equally&nbsp;lost and need Christ as Savior. As Jesus said:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 19:10 &ldquo;For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, our duty toward those who practice homosexuality is no different than to any other unbeliever we encounter. We are called to reflect the grace and mercy of Christ in the hope they will believe and be saved. We cannot condone their sin,&nbsp;but our primary goal must be to win them for Christ, not to shame them and bully them. Only the Lord can change a heart, and He does so through a patient, loving witness to the Truth.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Are Practicing Homosexual Excluded From Salvation?<br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>Based on Paul&#39;s strong statements, we might wonder if a practicing homosexual may ever enter Heaven? The simple answer is yes, provided the person has been born again by the Spirit. Everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved, scripture teaches. On the other hand, this answer avoids the real question: can a true believer follow the homosexual lifestyle without conviction and regret?</p>\n\n<p>To this question, the Bible would answer no, since every true believer is disciplined by the Lord and experiences conviction whenever they sin:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 12:5 and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons,<br />\n&ldquo; MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD,<br />\nNOR&nbsp; FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM;<br />\nHeb. 12:6&nbsp; FOR THOSE&nbsp; WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES,<br />\nAND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&rdquo;<br />\nHeb. 12:7 It is for discipline that you endure;&nbsp; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?<br />\nHeb. 12:8 But if you are without discipline,&nbsp; of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.<br />\nHeb. 12:9 Furthermore, we had&nbsp; earthly fathers to discipline us, and we&nbsp; respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to&nbsp; the Father of&nbsp; spirits, and&nbsp; live?<br />\nHeb. 12:10 For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good,&nbsp; so that we may share His holiness.<br />\nHeb. 12:11 All discipline&nbsp; for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the&nbsp; peaceful fruit of righteousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice in v.6 the writer quotes from Proverbs by saying the Lord scourges (i.e., disciplines) every son (i.e., believer). No true believer goes without discipline when he sins, and so if a Christian chooses to engage in homosexual behavior, they will inevitably experience regret and receive the Lord&#39;s discipline. Their spiritual conviction betrays them since it demonstrates they are the Lord&#39;s child and yet their actions are displeasing to Him.</p>\n\n<p>Though a Christian engaging in homosexual conduct may claim to feel no regret, they will be burdened by guilt, scripture teaches. Such feeling and thoughts are unavoidable, for if disobedient believers did not experience these things, they would be illegitimate children (i.e., not true believers), according to Hebrews.&nbsp; So believers may practice homosexuality, but they cannot do so without regret and conviction.</p>\n\n<p>These rebellious believers usually justify their behavior as the result of \"how God made me\" or a natural variation on human sexuality, but inside their conscience says otherwise. As they experience the chastisement of the Lord and the conviction of the Spirit, perhaps one day they will exhibit repentance and remorse and seek to please the Lord. In other cases, they may never repent, fulfilling the warning of Hebrews 6:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 6:4 For in the case of those who have once been&nbsp; enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,<br />\nHeb. 6:5 and&nbsp; have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,<br />\nHeb. 6:6 and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThese believers may persevere in their sin, but if they do, they will see the Lord&#39;s displeasure evident in various consequences, including loss of eternal reward. Though they can never lose a salvation that was given to them by grace, nevertheless they are in jeopardy of receiving a harsh judgment when they stand before their Lord, and as Paul says in 1Corinthians 3, they will enter as through fire, with all their reward burned up.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, based on Paul&#39;s teaching, we can safely assume that the majority of practicing homosexuals are not Christians, including many of those who claim to be followers of Christ. At the same time, a small minority of practicing homosexuals may, in fact, be Christians who have chosen to live in serious disobedience to their Lord. While they may pretend to have no regrets, they will experience conviction by the Spirit, and their conscience will be burdened. Since they grieve the Spirit living in them, the Lord will discipline them with severe consequences.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. What does the Bible say about animals in Heaven? WIll I see my dogs or cats in Heaven?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA. Before we can answer your quesiton, we need to define \"heaven\" according to the Bible. Heaven is not a single place, according to scripture. Heaven is a state of being, which takes place in multiple places throughout God&#39;s program. During the period of human history prior to the fall of sin, Heaven was the state of Adam and Woman&#39;s existence in the Garden. They walked with God, knew God and were not ashamed of anything.</p>\n\n<p>After the fall of Adam and Woman, heaven was taken away from them on earth, and only after the death and removal of the sinful body did they have opportunity to return to a blissful existence in God&#39;s care. Heaven was a place called Sheol in the Old Testament. This place held the souls of the departed saints until Christ came and died to make atonement for sin. You can read more about this place in our article on <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/explain_where_we_go_when_we_die/\">Heaven and Hell</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As explain in that article, all who die in faith today are taken (in spirit form) to be with Christ in the heavenly realm. Even this existence is not a permanent home, since the saints return to the Earth with Christ at His Second Coming, according to Revelation 19. At that point, we live in a \"heaven\" on Earth for 1,000 years until the Earth is destroyed and a New Heavens and Earth are created. Finally, the New Jerusalem becomes our heaven according to Revelation 21.</p>\n\n<p>In answer to your question, the Bible mentions the presence of animals in at least some of the places we call \"heaven.\" Specifically, in the Garden, Adam and Woman enjoyed the companionship of animals. Secondly, in the 1,000 years of living and ruling on Earth with Christ, the Bible describes the presence of animals living with men in harmony and without conflict:</p>\n\n<h5>Is. 65:17 &nbsp;&ldquo;For behold, I create&nbsp; new heavens and a new earth;<br />\nAnd the former things will not be remembered or come to&nbsp; mind.<br />\nIs. 65:18 &ldquo;But be&nbsp; glad and rejoice forever in what I create;<br />\nFor behold, I create Jerusalem for rejoicing<br />\nAnd her people for gladness.<br />\nIs. 65:19 &ldquo;I will also&nbsp; rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people;<br />\nAnd there will no longer be heard in her<br />\nThe voice of&nbsp; weeping and the sound of crying.<br />\nIs. 65:20 &ldquo;No longer will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days,<br />\nOr an old man who does&nbsp; not&nbsp; live out his days;<br />\nFor the youth will die at the age of one hundred<br />\nAnd the one who does not reach the age of one hundred<br />\nWill be thought accursed.<br />\nIs. 65:21 &ldquo;They will&nbsp; build houses and inhabit them;<br />\nThey will also plant vineyards and eat their fruit.<br />\nIs. 65:22 &ldquo;They will not build and&nbsp; another inhabit,<br />\nThey will not plant and another eat;<br />\nFor&nbsp; as the&nbsp; lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people,<br />\nAnd My chosen ones will&nbsp; wear out the work of their hands.<br />\nIs. 65:23 &ldquo;They will&nbsp; not labor in vain,<br />\nOr bear children for calamity;<br />\nFor they are the&nbsp;&nbsp; offspring of those blessed by the LORD,<br />\nAnd their descendants with them.<br />\nIs. 65:24 &ldquo;It will also come to pass that before they call, I will&nbsp; answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.<br />\nIs. 65:25 &ldquo;The&nbsp; wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the&nbsp; lion will eat straw like the ox; and&nbsp; dust will be the serpent&rsquo;s food. They will&nbsp; do no evil or harm in all My&nbsp; holy mountain,&rdquo; says the LORD.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice that the Lord says in the 1,000 year kingdom to come there will be animals living, and they will lie down together in harmony. We do not know if the animals in the kingdom will include pets, but it&#39;s reasonable to assume that we will find dogs, cats and other domesticated pets among the animals in the Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, will we find our own pets resurrected and retaining a memory of us from our years together on Earth? This seems unlikely. The Bible teaches that all life on Earth that comes from the ground (i.e., men, animals and plants) will return to dust because of the curse God pronounced after Adam&#39;s sin in Genesis 3. Furthermore, God only gives \"help\" (i.e., a plan of redemption and resurrection) to men, according to the BIble. He doesn&#39;t give a way for angels (or presuambly the animal kingdom) to be redeemed from the curse, according to Hebrews 2:16.</p>\n\n<p>So while we would love to say that all our pets will be in the Kingdom waiting for us, it&#39;s safer to assume we will have an opportunity to enjoy new pets without the worry of death or pain or suffering.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, poodles are excluded.</p>"

If a believer asks God to forgive his sins, isn&#39;t that a lack of faith in God&#39;s promises, since you are asking Him for something He has already given you?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. In one sense, your statement is correct. The Bible teaches that a person need not ask for saving forgiveness more than once. In other words, once we have appealed to God for mercy, trusting upon His Son to save us from the penalty of sin, then we are saved and will never bear the punishment for our sins. As Paul summarizes in Rom. 10:9: \"that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved...\" Nothing more is required.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, a Christian is also called by Scripture to maintain a repentant heart, routinely acknowledging sin and seeking God&#39;s grace and mercy in the midst of his daily mistakes. These activities are not done with the intent to secure or maintain salvation, yet they are expected nonetheless.</p>\n\n<p>VBVMI&nbsp;uses a simple convention to explain the&nbsp;distinction between two kinds of repentance described in the Bible. You could say that the Bible teaches the need for&nbsp;Repentance (with a big \"R\") and repentance (with a little \"r\"). Repentance (big \"R\")&nbsp;refers to the&nbsp;repentance that happens during our&nbsp;salvation moment. This is a repentance from dead works and a life lived apart from God. It acknowledges we are sinners and in need of God&#39;s mercy and forgiveness if we are to avoid the penalty of sin, which is eternal death.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This repentance is an unique kind of repentance that only the&nbsp;Holy Spirit can produce in the heart of an unbeliever, which leads&nbsp;to acceptance of&nbsp;the Gospel, as Paul states:</p>\n\n<h5>For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death. -&nbsp;2Cor 7:10<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The second kind of repentance (a little \"r\")&nbsp;is the regret or sorrow that believers experience dailiy when convicted of their sinful behaviors. Becoming a Christian removes the penalty of sin, but it doesn&#39;t (immediately) remove the reality of sin in our earthly life. So, we have need for this secondary form of repentance, which is&nbsp;also the work of the Holy Spirit, to produce a sanctifying process. As the Holy Spirit convicts believers of daily sin, He is prompting repentance and leading us into&nbsp;a more Christ-like life.</p>\n\n<p>This second kind of repentance isn&#39;t an appeal for saving forgiveness - we already have that by faith. Rather, it is an appeal for God to forgive us from the <em>consequences</em> of our sin. We aren&#39;t appealing for relief from Hell; we&#39;re appealing for relief from&nbsp;the discipline of the Lord. Much like a son appeals to his human father for mercy to avoid punishment, we ask the Father to spare us as well. And John says the Lord will forgive us in this way if we repent:</p>\n\n<h5>1John 1:9&nbsp; If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and&nbsp;to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThere are a couple of good examples (among many) in Scripture to illustrate this principle of repentance for the believer. First, consider Jesus&#39; instructions to the church of Ephesus in Revelation:</p>\n\n<h5>Rev. 2:5 &lsquo;Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and&nbsp; repent and&nbsp; do the&nbsp; deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your&nbsp; lampstand out of its place &mdash; unless you repent.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Jesus told the church in Ephesus that they must repent of their poor witness (i.e., leaving their first love), or else He will end the church&#39;s very existence. Here we see a connection between a believers&#39; sin and God visiting the consequences of their sin upon them. If the church didn&#39;t repent of their sin, Jesus would visit the consequences of their sin upon the church.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, if believers live in unrepentant sin, they will see the consequences of their sin visited upon them as discipline from the Lord. As the writer to Hebrews 12:7-11 says plainly:</p>\n\n<h5>It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?<br />\nBut if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.<br />\nFurthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?<br />\nFor they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.<br />\nAll discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>A second example is found in the life of David in 2Sam 12:13-16:</p>\n\n<h5>Then David said to Nathan, &ldquo; I have sinned against the LORD.&rdquo; And Nathan said to David, &ldquo;The LORD also has taken away your sin; you shall not die.<br />\n&ldquo;However, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.&rdquo;<br />\nSo Nathan went to his house. &nbsp;Then the LORD struck the child that Uriah&rsquo;s widow bore to David, so that he was very sick.<br />\nDavid therefore inquired of God for the child; and David fasted and went and lay all night on the ground.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In 2Sam 12, David is praying and fasting for the Lord to spare his son, who is near death. David knows that his son&#39;s condition was brought upon him by the Lord as punishment against David for his unrepentant sin with Bathsheba. David prays for the Lord to show mercy instead.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Scripture says plainly that David&#39;s sin has already been taken away by his faith, so salvation was not in question. Nonetheless, David feels the need to pray for forgiveness, because he wishes to save his son.</span></p>\n\n<p>The Lord bring discipline against David because of his sin, and even knowing his has been forgiven, David still prays for mercy for his son&#39;s sake. Obviously, the Lord rejected David&#39;s plea and takes the son anyway, but this is an excellent example of why a believer may pray in repentance even though salvation has removed the penalty of sin: we still may bear the consequences of our sin in this life.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the Lord expects believers to pray for forgiveness even after we are saved, but we do it for a different reason than the one we had before faith. Before faith, we prayed with a repentant heart longing for forgiveness leading to eternal life. Now having been saved, we still pray for forgiveness from the consequences of our sin.</p>"

From an earthly perspective, things may seem to happen at random, but throughout the whole of&nbsp;Scripture, it is clear God is in control of all His creation and is able to take the random&nbsp;acts of natural law, the free will of both good and evil people and the wicked intent of demons and combine&nbsp;them all to accomplish His good and perfect will (Genesis 50:20; Job chapters 1 and 42; John 9:1-7). Christians, specifically, are given the promise that God works all things, whether seemingly good or&nbsp;bad, together for good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28).<br />\n<br />\nSpurgeon wrote the following on God&rsquo;s control of all things:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>\"I believe that every particle of dust that dances in the sunbeam does not move an atom more or less than God wishes &ndash; that every particle of&nbsp;spray that dashes against the steamboat has its orbit, as well as the sun in the heavens &ndash; that the chaff from the hand of the winnower is steered&nbsp;as the stars in their courses. The creeping of an aphid over the rosebud is as much fixed as the march of the devastating pestilence &ndash; the fall of . . .&nbsp;leaves from a poplar is as fully ordained as the tumbling of an avalanche.\"</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nBecause we do not have the curtains drawn back to see what is taking place in heaven, we cannot&nbsp;always determine whether God&rsquo;s active or passive will is involved in the events of our lives, but we do&nbsp;know from Scripture that all things take place are under the umbrella of His will, whether active or passive, and,&nbsp;therefore, nothing is a matter of mere chance. &nbsp;So it is for any event of life; no matter how small (Matthew 10:29-31) or how large (Daniel 4:35; Proverbs&nbsp;21:1), God is sovereign over all (Ephesians 1:11; Psalm 115:3; Isaiah 46:9-10), and thus nothing is&nbsp;merely the matter of chance.<br />\n<br />\nTherefore, based on our understanding of Scripture, we&nbsp;recommend a Christian&nbsp;not&nbsp;use the phrase &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; but instead make it a practice to say &ldquo;God&nbsp;bless you.\" Even when speaking to unbelievers, &ldquo;God bless you&rdquo; is much more significant and&nbsp;effective than the phrase &ldquo;good luck&rdquo;. Saying \"God bless you\" to a non-believer will embed that phrase in his mind and possibly open an opportunity to share the Gospel.&nbsp;</p>"

This refusal has caused great offense to the girl&#39;s family, and the&nbsp;wedding may not go ahead. What is the Christian response to this situation?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In your question, you didn&rsquo;t specify whether the bride and the groom themselves&nbsp;were Christians. If both are Christian, then they should live their lives for Christ witnessing to the truth of the Gospel in everything they do and say, including in how they conduct their wedding ceremony.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/iStock_000007091698Small.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:199px; margin:10px; width:300px\" /></p>\n\n<p>In that case, they would be wrong to agree to any ritual or statement contrary to their faith in Christ. Certainly, burning incense to dead ancestors is occult behavior and makes a Christian a sharer in demons, according to 1Corinthians 10:20-21.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if only one member of the couple is Christian (either bride or groom), then the marriage shouldn&rsquo;t take place at all. The Bible clearly teaches that Christians are only to marry other Christians. To do otherwise leads to an unequal marriage with significant negative consequences, as Paul teaches in 2Corinthians:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 6:14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be&nbsp;bound together with&nbsp;unbelievers; for what&nbsp;partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 6:15&nbsp;Or what&nbsp;&nbsp;harmony has Christ with&nbsp;Belial, or&nbsp;&nbsp;what has a&nbsp;believer in common with an&nbsp;unbeliever?<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Finally, if neither groom no bride are believers, then there is no reason to oppose the marriage or insist on any particular wedding style or ritual. While a Buddhist ritual may offend Christian relatives, there is nothing to be gained by stopping it. The two will still be just as unsaved without the Buddhist ritual as with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;bigger concern for the Christian family should be the couple&#39;s absence of saving faith. Prohibiting a certain wedding ritual will profit no one in eternity. Instead, the Christian family members should place all their time and attention into preaching the Gospel to these young lovers in the hope that they may be saved in the Day of the Lord.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

All who believe receive the Holy Spirit as a down payment or pledge of God&rsquo;s promise to resurrect them into glory with Christ.</p>\n\n<h5><br />\n2Cor. 1:21&nbsp;Now He who&nbsp;&nbsp;establishes us with you in Christ and&nbsp;&nbsp;anointed us is God,&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 1:22&nbsp;who also&nbsp;&nbsp;sealed us and&nbsp;&nbsp;gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a&nbsp;&nbsp;pledge.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n2Cor. 5:4&nbsp;For indeed while we are in this tent, we&nbsp;&nbsp;groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be&nbsp;&nbsp;clothed, so that what is&nbsp;&nbsp;mortal will be swallowed up by life.&nbsp;<br />\n2Cor. 5:5&nbsp;Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who&nbsp;&nbsp;gave to us the Spirit as a&nbsp;&nbsp;pledge.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5><br />\nEph. 1:13&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;Him, you also, after listening to&nbsp;&nbsp;the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation &mdash; having also&nbsp;&nbsp;believed, you were&nbsp;&nbsp;sealed in&nbsp;&nbsp;Him with&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy Spirit of promise,&nbsp;<br />\nEph. 1:14&nbsp;who is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given as a pledge of&nbsp;&nbsp;our inheritance, with a view to the&nbsp;&nbsp;redemption of&nbsp;&nbsp;God&rsquo;s own possession,&nbsp;&nbsp;to the praise of His glory.</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nHowever, it&rsquo;s important to remember that this ministry of the Holy Spirit did not begin until the day of Pentecost. Prior to Pentecost, the Spirit was still working to bring faith to the heart (for it has always been this way), but the Spirit did not remain with a believer in a permanent manner until Pentecost. The Old Testament saint was no less a believer and no less saved, but the power of God was not present and working in them in the way He does today.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nInstead, the Holy Spirit is seen to &ldquo;come upon&rdquo; a saint at various times as an anointing for ministry. For example, prophets would experience the Spirit of God coming upon them so they might speak prophecy. Here are a variety of examples from the Old Testament:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Judg. 3:9&nbsp;When the sons of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the sons of Israel to deliver them,&nbsp;&nbsp;Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb&rsquo;s younger brother.&nbsp;<br />\nJudg. 3:10&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. When he went out to war, the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of&nbsp;&nbsp;Mesopotamia into his hand, so that&nbsp;&nbsp;he prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Judg. 6:34&nbsp;So&nbsp;&nbsp;the Spirit of the LORD&nbsp;&nbsp;came upon Gideon; and he&nbsp;&nbsp;blew a trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called together to follow him.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Judg. 14:5&nbsp; Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion came roaring toward him.&nbsp;<br />\nJudg. 14:6&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit of the LORD&nbsp;&nbsp;came upon him mightily, so that&nbsp;&nbsp;he tore him as one tears a young goat though he had nothing in his hand; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1Sam. 19:20&nbsp;Then&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul sent messengers to take David, but when they saw&nbsp;&nbsp;the company of the prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God&nbsp;came upon&nbsp;the messengers of Saul; and&nbsp;&nbsp;they also prophesied.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>&nbsp;2Chr. 20:14&nbsp;Then in the midst of the assembly&nbsp;&nbsp;the Spirit of the LORD&nbsp;came upon&nbsp;Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite of the sons of Asaph;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nThere are also examples of the Spirit of God departing a saint due to his sin, as with Saul:</p>\n\n<h5>1Sam. 16:14&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the&nbsp;Spirit&nbsp;of the LORD&nbsp;departed&nbsp;from Saul, and&nbsp;&nbsp;an evil&nbsp;spirit&nbsp;from the LORD terrorized him.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nSo in the days prior to Pentecost, the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit would come and go, depending on circumstances. To repeat, this does NOT mean the person was less a believer or less &ldquo;saved&rdquo; if the Spirit departed. Once the person received saving faith by the power of the Spirit, that person was forever changed by faith. Nevertheless, the power of God&rsquo;s Spirit was not permanently indwelling the OT saint.<br />\nJesus was the first One to be promised by the Father to have the permanent presence of the Spirit:</p>\n\n<h5>Is. 59:20&nbsp;&ldquo;A&nbsp;&nbsp;Redeemer will come to Zion,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And to those who&nbsp;&nbsp;turn from transgression in Jacob,&rdquo; declares the LORD.&nbsp;<br />\nIs. 59:21&nbsp; &ldquo;As for Me, this is My&nbsp;&nbsp;covenant with them,&rdquo; says the LORD: &ldquo;My&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit which is upon you, and My&nbsp;&nbsp;words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your&nbsp;&nbsp;offspring, nor from the mouth of your&nbsp;&nbsp;offspring&rsquo;s offspring,&rdquo; says the LORD, &ldquo;from now and forever.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nAnd now the NT believer is promised to share in Jesus&rsquo; future, to include a permanent indwelling of God&rsquo;s Spirit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the disciples&rsquo; moment in John 21, this occurs prior to Pentecost, so we must understand that moment as the Lord Spirit&rsquo;s coming upon the disciples as an anointing for the events that would follow. The Lord was providing them with a visible symbol (i.e. the Lord&rsquo;s breath) to show them they had received power from God. (In Hebrew, the word for &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;breath&rdquo; are nearly identical). This anointing was not a substitute for the permanent indwelling of the Spirit, which was yet to come for these disciples.</p>\n\n<p>Later in Acts 2, the disciples received the indwelling of the Spirit, which was a permanent seal of their faith.</p>"

We strongly believe&nbsp;that each and every Christian should be water baptized by immersion. Baptism illustrates a believer&rsquo;s identification with Christ&rsquo;s&nbsp;death, burial, and resurrection. &nbsp;Romans 6:3-4 declares, &ldquo;Or don&#39;t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were&nbsp;baptized into His death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from&nbsp;the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.&rdquo; The action of being immersed in the water illustrates dying and&nbsp;being buried with Christ. The action of coming out of the water pictures Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.<br />\n<br />\nNevertheless, the only baptism required for salvation is the baptism of the Holy Spirit, which accompanies a true confession of faith.&nbsp;Requiring anything in addition to faith in Jesus Christ for salvation is a works-based salvation and is false. If a believer refuses water baptism, then they are disobeying the Lord and will not find themselves growing in His grace so long as they are determined to disobey His word.<br />\n<br />\nA refusal to accept water baptism might be an indication that the person&#39;s confession of faith was not sincere. In such a case, we could say that their refusal is the evidence of unbelief, but since we cannot know their heart with certainty, we cannot construct a general rule from this situation. A refusal to be water baptized may be a sign of unbelief, but it can also be evidence of a believer&#39;s disobedience or spiritual immaturity. Both situations are possible, so we cannot make a rule.<br />\n<br />\nIf you are interested in reading more about the difference between water baptism and the baptism of the Holy Spirit, please read the following article: <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/is_baptism_required_for_salvation/\" target=\"_blank\">Is Baptism Required for Salvation</a>.</p>"

Why didn&#39;t he forgive or just ignore them? &nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nFirst, the Hebrew word translated \"children&rdquo; (or young lads in the NASB) refers to men who were in their youth, so typically this meant men between the ages of 18 and 30. Most modern translations use the word \"youth\" in this passage, not children, to reflect that this mob was not a mere group of children teasing an old man. These were young men who knew exactly who they were mocking and what they were doing.</p>\n\n<p>So, we must consider the context of these events to understand why they mocked Elisha and why Elisha responded with a curse.</p>\n\n<p>First, in 2Kings 2 Elisha had just assumed the role of prophet of Israel in place of the previous prophet, Elijah. Moments earlier, God had removed Elijah from the earth in a spectacular, supernatural manner:</p>\n\n<h5>2Kings 2:11 As they were going along and talking, behold, there appeared&nbsp; a chariot of fire and horses of fire which separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a&nbsp; whirlwind to heaven.<br />\n2Kings 2:12 Elisha saw it and cried out, &ldquo; My father, my father, the&nbsp; chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&rdquo;And he saw&nbsp; Elijah no more.

The chariot was visible to more than just Elisha, because immediately after the event, others nearby offered to go looking for Elijah believing that the charoit would drop him off on earth somewhere nearby.</p>\n\n<h5>2Kings 2:15&nbsp; Now when&nbsp; the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho opposite him saw him, they said, &ldquo;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&rdquo;And they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him.<br />\n2Kings 2:16 They said to him, &ldquo;Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men, please let them go and search for your master; perhaps&nbsp; the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and cast him on some mountain or into some valley.&rdquo;And he said, &ldquo;You shall not send.&rdquo;<br />\n2Kings 2:17 But when&nbsp; they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, &ldquo;Send.&rdquo;They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched three days but did not find him.<br />\n2Kings 2:18 They returned to him while he was staying at Jericho; and he said to them, &ldquo;Did I not say to you, &lsquo;Do not go&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Elisha knows better than to go looking for Elijah, since he knew Elijah will not be found, so he refuses to join the search party. Later in Jericho the searchers report back to Elisha that their mission failed, to which Elisha says, \"I told you so.\" At this point Elisha leaves for Bethel, and as he is leaving, a gang of young men from Jericho begin mocking Elijah on his way:</p>\n\n<h5>2Kings 2:23 Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up by the way, young lads came out from the city and&nbsp; mocked him and said to him, &ldquo;Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead!&rdquo;<br />\n2Kings 2:24 When he looked behind him and saw them, he&nbsp; cursed them in the name of the LORD. Then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up forty-two lads of&nbsp; their number.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>These men are in the same area in which all these events take place, so it is clear they understood what had just happened to Elijah. Notice their chant to Elisha: &ldquo;Go up, bald head, go up&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp; That phrase means they wished Elisha would disappear up in the clouds just as Elijah had gone up earlier. Their chant reveals their hearts. They do not wish to bear the chastisement of a prophet of God. Their sin convicts them, and they want to cast off the restraints of God&rsquo;s word delivered through the prophets. They were pleased to see Elijah go, and now they wish to see Elisha gone as well.</p>\n\n<p>So these youths were no innocent group of children. They were a large gang of 40+ men, who surrounded Elisha mocking and probably threatening him. More importantly, they demonstrated their unbelieving and blasphemous hearts in the way they treated the anointed prophet of God. Therefore, Elisha acted under the influence of the Spirit to speak a curse against these men and their wicked ways.<br />\n<br />\nFulfilling Elisha&#39;s prophecy, the Lord sent two bears to attack the men. Elisha walked away unharmed, yet the forty-two men did not. Also note the Bible says the youth were torn apart, which means gravely harmed but not necessarily killed (though some may have died). This was the Lord&rsquo;s judgment on these men, not merely Elisha&rsquo;s. Elisha didn&rsquo;t control the actions of the bear, but we know God did.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, this moment was orchestrated by the Lord to ensure the people of Israel understood that Elisha would have the same power God gave to Elijah in his day. In fact, Elisha performed twice as many miracles over his tenure as did Elijah.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Does Satan understand the plan God has designed and what is to come? If so, why does he wait to carry out these actions instead of acting now on his desire to ruin God&#39;s plan?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To understand Satan&rsquo;s work, we should first remember that God is always in control of all things, including Satan&rsquo;s actions. As we can see clearly in the book of Job, Satan cannot act to cause harm without God&rsquo;s allowance. Secondly, Satan is a created being, so he is limited by his nature and abilities. He is not omnipresent nor is he omniscient. Finally, as a fallen creature, Satan is a prisoner of his own sinful nature, leaving him unable to understand God&rsquo;s word or to act in any manner other than opposing God&rsquo;s will.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Satan cannot understand the plans or purposes of God beyond a limited degree, since he cannot understand scripture. In fact, the reason so much of scripture is taught through parable or prophecies with obscured interpretations is to thwart Satan&rsquo;s ability to understand and interfere with God&rsquo;s plan. Only those to whom God grants the ability to understand scripture will know the future. To the rest - including Satan -&nbsp;the truth remains out of reach.</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 13:10&nbsp; And the disciples came and said to Him, &ldquo;Why do You speak to them in parables?&rdquo;<br />\nMatt. 13:11&nbsp; Jesus answered them, &ldquo;To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Finally, God is preventing Satan from taking steps too early, in keeping with God&rsquo;s timing. For example, Satan would prefer to raise up an antichrist&nbsp;at any time, but God is restraining Satan until the church has been removed from the earth at the rapture. Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>2Th. 2:6 And you know&nbsp; what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed.<br />\n2Th. 2:7 For&nbsp; the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only&nbsp; he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.<br />\n2Th. 2:8 Then that lawless one&nbsp; will be revealed whom the Lord will slay&nbsp; with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the&nbsp; appearance of His&nbsp; coming;<br />\n2Th. 2:9 that is, the one whose&nbsp; coming is in accord with the activity of&nbsp; Satan, with all power and&nbsp;&nbsp; signs and false wonders,<br />\n2Th. 2:10 and with&nbsp; all the deception of wickedness for&nbsp; those who perish, because they did not receive the love of&nbsp; the truth so as to be saved.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So Satan is largely unaware of what God plans to do, and his own plans to disrupt creation are managed by the Lord to ensure it falls within God&rsquo;s purposes and timing.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<strong><em>Can we tell children God loves them? Does God only love believers?&nbsp;</em></strong><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Bible clearly states that God sees believers in Jesus Christ as His children, while unbelievers are excluded from relationship with the Father. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to refrain from telling children that God loves them based on this precept of scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, a young child may, in fact, already be a believer. Many believers come to faith at a very early age, and so we cannot exclude the possibility that a young child has been given the gift of faith and is loved by Christ in that sense.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, scripture tells us that the love of God is evidenced by His plan of salvation and the call of the Gospel sent out to the nations. The Lord shows His love to the world by sending the message of the Gospel through His Son so that many may be saved.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul says it is the kindness of God that leads us to repentance, and that love is at work in a person&#39;s life even before they come to faith in Christ. Paul taught that the Lord loves those He has chosen from before the foundations of the world:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 1:3&nbsp;&nbsp; Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,<br />\n\tEph. 1:4&nbsp; just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be&nbsp; holy and blameless before Him.&nbsp; In love<br />\n\tEph. 1:5&nbsp; He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the&nbsp; kind intention of His will,<br />\n\tEph. 1:6&nbsp; to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPaul says that God&rsquo;s love for us is the reason He predestined us to adoption as sons (and daughters). Since we cannot know (in advance) if the Lord intends to save a person (including a child), we can speak in hopeful terms to everybody concerning God&#39;s love. This is no different than when we evangelize by saying that God so loved the world that he sent His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWe understand that a person can only be &ldquo;loved&rdquo; by God through faith in Jesus Christ, but because we cannot know the future for anyone, we declare God&#39;s love for everyone in hopeful terms. Talking to a child about the love of God in this way is no different.</p>\n<p>\n\tThirdly, God shows kindness and love for the unbelieving world in many ways through His care for Creation, according to scripture. The Bible says the Father shows His love and favor even to His &ldquo;enemies\" when He permits them to enjoy a fruitful life on earth:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 5:44 &ldquo;But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,<br />\n\tMatt. 5:45 so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tFinally, the Lord is loving to unbelievers in showing patience with their sin, as Peter says:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 9:22&nbsp; What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much&nbsp; patience vessels of wrath&nbsp; prepared for destruction?<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tSo we can confidently tell our young children that Jesus loves them.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Do the offices of apostle and prophet still exist in the church?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA. The title \"apostle\" means one sent with a message, and it is a special office in the history of the church. Apostles were men who were appointed by Christ through a personal appearing (e.g. Paul on the road to Damascus) to hold the office. Only those who have personally witnessed the risen Christ in the flesh and received a commission directly from Him may assume this title. There were more than twelve apostles appointed in the early church, and these men lived until the end of the first century, which is why Paul still refers to this office as active in Ephesians 4:11. When the last apostle, John, died at the end of the first century,&nbsp;the office of apostle&nbsp;ceased to exist in the church. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Christ established this office to author the New Testament canon through these men, and they were given unique miraculous powers to validate their ministry and authenticate their teaching. For example, the apostle Paul told the church in Corinth they could trust his word over that of false teachers because his powers validated his ministry:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 4:18 Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.<br />\n1Cor. 4:19 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I shall find out, not the words of those who are arrogant but their power.<br />\n1Cor. 4:20 For the kingdom of God does not consist in words but in power.</h5>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 13:10 For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.</h5>\n\n<p>Paul told Corinth that those who claimed to have authority by their words must demonstrate they also possess the power that came with apostolic authority otherwise they were not legitimate authority figures in the church. &nbsp;Such a test no longer exists in the church because the apostolic office no longer exists. In place of apostles we have the full counsel of God&#39;s word.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, men (and even women) uninformed by the word of God or deceived by false teaching&nbsp;may attempt to appropriate this title for themselves, just as false apostles existed in the early church. In all cases, false apostles are shown to be counterfeits because they cannot perform the miracles required to validate their title. All apostles were given unique gifts of the spirit to validate their positions of authority. Christ told the apostles they could cast out demons, heal the sick, raise the dead and receive fatal snake bites but not die. Though the Lord may permit an individual Christian to do one or more of these miracles in rare cases, they&nbsp;are not normal Christian gifts; they were unique to apostles.</p>\n\n<p>You can learn more about why the Lord established the office of apostle in the early church (and why it no longer exists) in our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/acts_of_the_apostles/acts_of_the_apostles_lesson_1/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\" target=\"_blank\">Acts of the Apostles</a>&nbsp;Bible study.</p>\n\n<p>The office of prophet is also misunderstood. The Bible uses the term prophet to describe a man gifted to deliver God&#39;s revelation to men. A prophet&#39;s words were recorded and eventually made a part of the canon of scripture. The office of prophet carries significant responsibilities and burdens, according to scripture. Specifically, the Bible says this concerning the office of prophet:</p>\n\n<h5>Deut. 13:1&nbsp; &ldquo;If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder,<br />\nDeut. 13:2&nbsp; and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, &lsquo; Let us go after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,&rsquo;<br />\nDeut. 13:3&nbsp; you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the LORD your God is&nbsp; testing you to find out if&nbsp; you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.<br />\nDeut. 13:4&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall follow the LORD your God and fear Him; and you shall keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and&nbsp; cling to Him.<br />\nDeut. 13:5&nbsp; &ldquo;But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be&nbsp; put to death, because he has&nbsp; counseled&nbsp; rebellion against the LORD your God who brought you from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of&nbsp; slavery, to seduce you from the way in which the LORD your God commanded you to walk.&nbsp; So you shall purge the evil from among you.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The Bible taught Israel that anyone claiming the office of prophet was required to be 100% correct in ALL prophecies. If a supposed prophet was ever incorrect in their prophetic utterances - even just once - then they were to be put to death, according to the word. Many churches fail to understand this rigorous standard for prophecy required by scripture, and therefore we are tempted to assign this title too easily to those who wish to claim it. In reality, the biblical office of prophet no longer exists in the church, since the canon of scripture has been completed.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Lord may bring supernatural insight concerning future events to anyone at anytime, but such a moment doesn&#39;t mean the person has become a prophet in the biblical sense. It simply means God has chosen to reveal something to them at a point in time for a certain purpose. This type of prophecy shouldn&#39;t be mistaken for the office of prophet.</p>\n\n<p>Many men and women go around in the church proclaiming themselves to be prophets, but if we apply the test God gives us in Deuteronomy, we quickly find these people to be frauds deceiving believers.&nbsp; Remember this exchange in Jeremiah:</p>\n\n<h5>Jer. 14:13&nbsp; But, &ldquo;Ah, Lord&nbsp; GOD!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Look, the prophets are telling them, &lsquo;You&nbsp; will not see the sword nor will you have famine, but I will give you&nbsp; lasting&nbsp; peace in this place.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />\nJer. 14:14 Then the LORD said to me, &ldquo;The&nbsp; prophets are prophesying falsehood in My name.&nbsp; I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them; they are prophesying to you a&nbsp; false vision, divination, futility and the deception of their own&nbsp; minds.<br />\nJer. 14:15 &ldquo;Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name, although it was not I who sent them &mdash; yet they keep saying, &lsquo;There will be no sword or famine in this land&rsquo; &mdash;&nbsp; by sword and famine those prophets shall&nbsp; meet their end!<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In the church today, we find no evidence of apostles nor prophets operating as the Bible requires. Instead, we may find an occasional person given insight of future events on an occasional basis, but mostly we find frauds claiming to have powers they cannot validate in the way the Bible requires.</p>"

What does verse 29 mean for those set apart for the Lord?</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tA. Leviticus 27:29 is part of a section in the law that begins in v.14:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLev. 27:14 &lsquo;Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, then the priest shall value it&nbsp; as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand.<br />\n\tLev. 27:15 &lsquo;Yet if the one who consecrates it should wish to redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may be his.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe topic in this section is a home or field consecrated to the Lord (i.e., given to the priests for their use). If the owner of that property later wants to redeem it (i.e., buy it back from the priests), then he must pay the price the priests have determined the property is worth according to the law. For example, the Lord says:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLev. 27:19 &lsquo;If the one who consecrates it should ever wish to redeem the field, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may pass to him.<br />\n\tLev. 27:20 &lsquo;Yet if he will not redeem the field,&nbsp; but has sold the field to another man, it may no longer be redeemed;<br />\n\tLev. 27:21 and when it&nbsp; reverts in the jubilee, the field shall be holy to the LORD, like a field&nbsp; set apart;&nbsp; it shall be for the priest as his&nbsp; property.<br />\n\tLev. 27:22 &lsquo;Or if he consecrates to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not a part of the field of his own&nbsp; property,<br />\n\tLev. 27:23 then the priest shall calculate for&nbsp; him the amount of your valuation up to the year of jubilee; and he shall on that day give your valuation as holy to the LORD.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe see that the law established strict rules for how property set apart for the Lord could be transferred. Then in v.29, the Lord says that a man attempting to redeem property set apart for the Lord cannot use worthless things to pay the ransom. For example, the Lord says that a first born animal may not be used to pay the ransom, since all first born animals already belong to the Lord:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLev. 27:25 &lsquo;Every valuation of yours, moreover, shall be after&nbsp; the shekel of the sanctuary. The shekel shall be twenty gerahs.<br />\n\tLev. 27:26&nbsp; &lsquo;However, a firstborn among animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD, no man may consecrate it; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD&rsquo;S.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, a slave or any person already committed to the Lord under a vow (whether for good reasons or bad) cannot be used to ransom the property.</p>\n<h5>\n\tLev. 27:28 &lsquo;Nevertheless,&nbsp; anything which a man&nbsp; sets apart to the LORD out of all that he has, of man or animal or of the fields of his own property, shall not be sold or redeemed. Anything&nbsp; devoted to destruction is most holy to the LORD.<br />\n\tLev. 27:29 &lsquo;No&nbsp; one who may have been&nbsp; set apart among men shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tFor example, a slave who has been previously consecrated to the Lord is already the Lord&#39;s property, so such a slave could not be used as payment for the ransom. Likewise, a man already set apart to die for murder can be used to redeem property. That is the point of v.29.</p>"

Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 6:14&nbsp; Do not be&nbsp; bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?<br />\n2Cor. 6:15 Or what&nbsp; harmony has Christ with&nbsp; Belial, or&nbsp; what has a&nbsp; believer in common with an&nbsp; unbeliever?<br />\n2Cor. 6:16 Or&nbsp; what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are&nbsp; the temple of&nbsp; the living God; just as God said,<br />\n&ldquo; I WILL&nbsp; DWELL IN THEM AND&nbsp; WALK AMONG THEM;<br />\nAND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.<br />\n2Cor. 6:17 &ldquo; Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE SEPARATE,&rdquo; says the Lord.<br />\n&ldquo;AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN;<br />\nAnd I will welcome you.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The command of scripture is that a believer not be bound together with unbelievers. The Greek word translated into bound is heterozugeo, which literally means to be yoked together in a single team.</p>\n\n<p>When a farmer prepared to plow his field, he yoked two oxen together to pull the plow blade through the soil. The farmer would chose a pair of animals that were similar in size and strength so that they would pull together in unison, creating straight lines in the field. If the oxen team were imbalanced - if one ox were stronger or larger than the other - then the team couldn&#39;t pull with equal power. The oxen team would eventually go astray, leaving the straight rows and meandering off course.</p>\n\n<p>So the concept Paul teaches us is that a believer must not become yoked together with someone who does not agree with the believer&#39;s perspective of God, faith, godliness and obedience to Christ. If we become bound with an unbeliever in a solemn agreement (i.e., a marriage covenant), then we are unequally yoked and likely to be pulled astray from an obedient walk with Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Some Christians marry unbelievers thinking they will be the stronger \"ox\" in the relationship, pulling their unbelieving spouse into the straight and narrow path of obedience to God, but the Bible teachers that obedience is always predicated on faith in the Gospel:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Furthermore, no one can persuade or force an unbeliever to become born-again. Spiritual conversation is a change that God alone produces in the heart of an individual, and therefore marrying an unbeliever in the expectation of converting them is a foolish and presumptuous decision. Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 7:15 Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace.<br />\n1Cor. 7:16 For how do you know, O wife, whether you will&nbsp; save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul advises a believer who is married to an unbeliever that they cannot presume they will \"save\" their spouse. So if a believer marries an unbeliever with the expectation of converting their spouse, they commit a sin, because they openly disobey the word of God without cause to expect success. Moreover, they are signing up potentially for a life of spiritual difficulty, which carries eternal consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Since the unbeliever cannot please God without faith (and the believing spouse has no expectation of changing their situation), then by necessity the unbeliever will become the stronger \"ox\" in the relationship. Said another way, the believer won&#39;t steer the unbeliever into godliness; the unbeliever will steer the believer away from obedience. This is why Paul quotes in 2Cor 6:16-17 from the Law in reminding the church that the Lord ordered believers&nbsp;to separate themselves from committed associations with unbelievers to avoid their negative influences.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, a believer may not marry an unbeliever. If he or she does so, the believer is sinning, and the consequences for that sin will be lasting and potentially devastating. Marrying for love is a romantic notion, but romance and physical attraction are fleeting, while the spiritual consequences of disobedience to God&#39;s word are eternal.</p>"

Or, is that assumed?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. With respect to when a pope speaks infallibly, this was defined in Vatican I Council, in 1870.&nbsp; Specifically, the Catholic church said:</p>\n\n<p>\"We teach and define as a divinely revealed dogma that when the Roman pontiff speaks EX CATHEDRA, that is, when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole church, he possesses, by the divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, that infallibility which the divine Redeemer willed his church to enjoy in defining doctrine concerning faith or morals.&nbsp; Therefore, such definitions of the Roman pontiff are of themselves, and not by the consent of the church, irreformable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Now, this doctrine of papal infallibility was controversial when issued.&nbsp; There was (and remains) much disagreement among Catholic theologians as to exactly when the pope is speaking &ldquo;ex cathedra&rdquo;.&nbsp; Personally, I leave the debate to them.&nbsp; I simply take at face value what Vatican I declared (infallibly, by the way).&nbsp; So, applying that as the criteria, I believe it is fair to say that when the pope speaks about faith or morals, he is doing so as pope (i.e., he is speaking in the exercise of his office).&nbsp; In so doing, what he says is a doctrine to be held by the whole church.&nbsp; What he says, therefore, is infallible.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair, many Catholics would not agree with my view.&nbsp; They take a much more restricted view of infallibility.&nbsp; If I were a Catholic, I&rsquo;d do the same thing for this very reason, because popes have spoken obviously unbiblical things regarding faith and morals over the years, which causes big problems for you if you are Catholic.&nbsp; They try to limit papal infallibility to &ldquo;official&rdquo; statements (whatever that means) issued by the pope as opposed to remarks he may make in speeches, such the one referred to in my article.</p>\n\n<p>In my view, the pope doesn&rsquo;t get a break on such a restricted view of infallibility.&nbsp; Think about what the statement from Vatican I says.&nbsp; The &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; teaching of Vatican I says that the pope, when he speaks on matters of faith and morals, is speaking by &ldquo;divine assistance&rdquo;.&nbsp; Therefore, it logically follows that whenever the pope speaks about faith and morals, he is doing so by the power of God (according to the Catholic church).&nbsp; If that is true, then by definition whatever he says regarding faith and morals must be &ldquo;infallible&rdquo;.&nbsp; One can&rsquo;t have it both ways.&nbsp; Either the pope speaks about faith and morals by divine assistance, or he doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You cannot limit statements on faith and morals to &ldquo;official&rdquo; statements.&nbsp; If you do, then the implication is that there are times when the pope speaks about faith and morals fallibly.&nbsp; If that is true, then what Vatican I stated cannot be true.&nbsp; So, I believe that anytime the pope says anything related to faith and morals, he must be speaking &ldquo;infallibly&rdquo;.</p>"

How can I know I have been saved?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nIn our experience, the only people who spend significant time worrying over whether&nbsp;they are truly Christians...<em>are&nbsp;Christians</em>. Generally speaking, unbelievers do not have concerns over whether they are truly Christian or whether they have salvation in Christ. In fact, Paul says:</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Cor. 1:18&nbsp; For the word of&nbsp;the cross is&nbsp;foolishness to&nbsp;those who&nbsp;are perishing, but to us who&nbsp;are being saved it is&nbsp;the power of God.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">If you lack confidence in&nbsp;your Christian faith, then ask yourself if you can agree with the following statement:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 10:8&nbsp;But what does it say? &ldquo;&nbsp;THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART&rdquo; &mdash; that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 10:9&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that&nbsp;&nbsp;God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">If you have&nbsp;confessed that Jesus is Lord (i.e., publicly declared your belief in Christ as Savior)&nbsp;and believed in your heart the scriptures that testify to Jesus&#39; resurrection, then you shall be saved and you are a Christian.

The Bible does not promise that we will experience a wonderful, pain free life once we become a Christian. On the contrary, the Bible says believers will very likely experience persecution and trials.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the love of God in the midst of these trials? The Bible says we may recognize&nbsp;the love of God in the very fact that Christ died for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1John 4:9&nbsp;By this the&nbsp;love of God&nbsp;was manifested&nbsp;in us, that&nbsp;God has sent His&nbsp;only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him.</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\nWe are not to rely on our feelings to discern God in our lives.

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. If a Christian gets a divorce and remarries, is he or she guilty of a continuous sin for as long as the new marriage continues?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA. Remarriage following divorce is an act of adultery, according to Jesus (<em>you can read why in our article on <a href=\"/bible-answers/can-a-believer-divorce-or-remarry\"><strong>Divorce</strong></a></em>), but does the sin of adultery continue as long as the new marriage exists? Is this couple supposed to divorce to correct for the earlier sin of adultery?</p>\n\n<p>In a word, no. Although the new marriage was formed through an act of adultery, this new covenant is valid and must be honored. The new marriage is legitimate in all respects, and a \"one-flesh\" relationship has been formed. Therefore, like all marriages&nbsp;the man and woman are expected to remain faithful to each other until death.</p>\n\n<p>We see this principle at work in many places in the Bible&nbsp;including the account of Jacob. Jacob was deceived into marrying Leah instead of Rachel. Did this mean his marriage was invalid? No. Furthermore, Jacob continued to pursue marriage with Rachel&nbsp;(wrongly) despite already being married to Leah. Jacob&#39;s marriage to Rachel was an act of adultery. In fact, Jacob took a total of four wives, nevertheless each marriage was legitimate and binding. Therefore, every marriage covenant must be honored, even one that was formed through an act of adultery.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, a second&nbsp;marriage following a divorce is not a \"continuous sin\" because marriage itself is never sin. Remarriage after divorce is sin because the marriage begins with an act of adultery as the new marriage is consummated. Having been consummated, however, the new marriage is then a true marriage and must be honored. Therefore, while the&nbsp;consequences of adultery may last a lifetime, the act itself is over in a moment.</p>\n\n<p>For example, murder is a sin that occurs in a moment, and it results in consequences that last a lifetime (i.e., the murder victim remains dead thereafter). Nevertheless, we don&#39;t say that the sin of murder is \"continuous\" simply because the victim remains dead. We understand that the sinful act occurred at a point in time yet it resulted in ongoing consequences. Likewise, adultery is a momentary act that produces ongoing consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So when a person remarries following a divorce, that person commits adultery against the first spouse. At the same time, they enter into a legitimate marriage that is binding for life. The person may not divorce the second spouse even to seek reconciliation with the first spouse since this would be a new act of sin, and the Lord doesn&#39;t command us to commit new sins in an effort to correct for past sins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In fact, God&#39;s word does not allow a first marriage to be reconciled if a second marriage had already been formed. Moses taught Israel that if a couple divorces and one remarries, then the first marriage may never be reconciled:</p>\n\n<h5>Deut. 24:1&nbsp; &ldquo;When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it happens&nbsp; that she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some&nbsp; indecency in her, and&nbsp; he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out from his house,<br />\nDeut. 24:2 and she leaves his house and goes and becomes another man&rsquo;s wife,<br />\nDeut. 24:3 and if the latter husband&nbsp; turns against her and writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies who took her to be his wife,<br />\nDeut. 24:4 then her&nbsp; former husband who sent her away is not allowed to take her again to be his wife, since she has been defiled; for that is an abomination before the LORD, and you shall not bring sin on the land which the LORD your God gives you as an inheritance.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>A woman who divorces and remarries and then divorces a second time was not permitted to return to her first husband even if he would have her. The woman&#39;s second marriage precluded reconciliation with her first husband&nbsp;because she was required to honor her second marriage until death, and reconciliation with her first husband would require an act of adultery against her second husband. This is further proof to us that God views a second marriage as legitimate and binding. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In short, every marriage is considered legitimate, and the Lord expects us to honor whatever marriage we have. Event though a second marriage is considered an act of adultery, the sin of adultery is not ongoing because the new marriage is valid. Therefore, the new marriage is legitimate and must be honored.</p>\n\n<p>If a Christian has divorced and remarried, he or she should acknowledge and repent of the sin of adultery, and then both spouses should honor the new marriage in peace knowing that they are forgiven their sins in Christ. From that point forward, they must commit to remaining faithful to this new marriage until death.</p>"

Whatever and whomever people think He is, one thing is for sure:&nbsp; there has never been any single person in the history of the world that has received more focus, attention and scrutiny than the man Jesus Christ.&nbsp; That Jesus actually lived is a historical fact, not only from the Bible, but also from many non-Biblical sources.&nbsp; The question we want to answer here, however, is perhaps one of the most important we can ask about Jesus:&nbsp; Is He God?</p>\n<p>\n\tThis question has enormous ramifications, not only for Christians, but for non-Christians as well.&nbsp; If Jesus is not God, then the Bible cannot be trusted, and Christians must then question everything they believe about their faith, about God, about Jesus Himself.&nbsp; For the unbeliever, if Jesus is God, then everything we as Christians say about Jesus is true, which means unbelievers need to pay serious attention to the Bible and what it says about life, death, and the hereafter.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we consider this important question, it&rsquo;s useful to ponder how we should go about questioning if Jesus is God.&nbsp; Since we are examining a historical person, we should ask the same questions we&rsquo;d ask about any other historical person.

You&rsquo;d want to know what the person said about himself, what others said about him, what the person did, how he lived, etc.&nbsp; When you put all of this together, you&rsquo;d have an objective view of who this person was.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll consider Jesus, with a focus on His deity.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\tJesus&rsquo; Claim to Deity<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps the first thing to examine is what Jesus said; that is, did He claim to be God?&nbsp; According to Scripture, He did indeed.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus&rsquo; first claim to deity is found in His confrontation with Satan. In Matthew 4, Scripture says that Jesus was led into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit to be tempted by Satan. The temptations demonstrate that Satan knew Jesus was God, as do Jesus&rsquo; responses.</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;8 Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; 9 and he said to Him, &ldquo;All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.&rdquo; 10 Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Go, Satan!&nbsp; For it is written, &lsquo;You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.&rsquo;&rdquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tJesus here claims that God alone is to receive worship.&nbsp; Yet, later in the gospels, Jesus receives worship but does not tell His disciples to stop.&nbsp; The angel in Revelation stopped John from worshiping him, saying worship God, yet Jesus does not prohibit people worshiping Him. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA good example is Matthew 28:9:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them.&nbsp; And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.&rdquo; (see also John 9:38, 20:28, Matthew 8:2, 9:18, 15:25)</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIn John 5, by calling God His own Father, Jesus made Himself equal with God and, as a result, the Jews sought to kill Him.&nbsp; Furthermore, Jesus claims to be able to do the same things the Father does, which only God can do, namely, raise the dead and give life.&nbsp; Finally, He claims that He will receive the same honor God the Father receives. This could not be a more clear claim to deity:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;18 For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.&nbsp; 19 Therefore Jesus answered and was saying to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless it is something He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, these things the Son also does in like manner. 20 For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than these, so that you will marvel. 21 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes. 22 For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son, 23 so that all will honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.&nbsp; 24 &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tConfirming that only God can put to death and gives life. &nbsp;Deuteronomy 32:39 says,&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;&lsquo;See now that I, I am He, And there is no god besides Me; It is I who put to death and give life.&nbsp; I have wounded and it is I who heal, And there is no one who can deliver from My hand.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn the John 5 above, Jesus claims this same power, making Himself equal with God.&nbsp;In John 8, Jesus again makes His claim of deity to the Pharisees:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;39 They answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Abraham is our father.&rdquo; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If you are Abraham&rsquo;s children, do the deeds of Abraham. 40 But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do&hellip;.&nbsp; 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.&rdquo; 57 So the Jews said to Him, &ldquo;You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?&rdquo; 58 Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.&rdquo; 59 Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tWhen Jesus said, &ldquo;I am&rdquo;, He was claiming the name of God.&nbsp; This is what God told Moses was His name, and the reaction of the Jews shows they clearly understood what Jesus was claiming.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn John 14, Jesus also claims equality with God:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;7 If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; 8 Philip said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.&rdquo; 9 Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, &lsquo;Show us the Father&rsquo;? 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works. 11 Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; otherwise believe because of the works themselves.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIn John 10, Jesus is even more direct:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;26 But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep. 27 My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; 28 and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. 29 My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father&rsquo;s hand. 30 I and the Father are one.&rdquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tNotice Jesus claims He does the same as the Father (gives life, claims equality with the One who is greater than all).&nbsp;Proving that He indeed was claiming to be God, we continue reading in John 10 that the Jews tried to kill Him for making this claim: &nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;31 The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him. 32 Jesus answered them, &ldquo;I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?&rdquo; 33 The Jews answered Him, &ldquo;For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.&rdquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tOnly God can forgive sins, yet Jesus made the same claim.&nbsp; In Mark 2, we read,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;5 And Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, &ldquo;Son, your sins are forgiven.&rdquo; 6 But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 7 &ldquo;Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?&rdquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tClearly, Jesus&rsquo; own words show that He claimed to be God.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\tThe Apostles Testify to Jesus&rsquo; Deity<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tContinuing our examination of Jesus&rsquo; claim to deity, we now want to consider what others said about Jesus.&nbsp; Those who knew Jesus best were His apostles and disciples, and they wrote a lot about Jesus.&nbsp; They were the authors of the New Testament, which gives us more evidence of Jesus&rsquo; deity.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn 1 says of Jesus,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being&hellip;. 14 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThis is a clear and direct statement of Jesus&rsquo; deity.&nbsp; Moreover, the word &ldquo;dwelt&rdquo; means &ldquo;tabernacled&rdquo;, which is the reality of the picture of Christ when God resided in the tabernacle with the Israelites in the wilderness.&nbsp; When He was born, He &ldquo;tabernacled&rdquo;, or dwelt, with men in the flesh.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn goes on in v. 18:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; In v. 14, John says Jesus is the only begotten from the Father; here, he makes clear that Jesus is God by calling Him the &ldquo;only begotten God.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThe apostle Thomas declared plainly of the risen Christ,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;Thomas answered and said to Him, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo;&rdquo; (John 20:28)</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tWhile all of Jesus&rsquo; apostles were Jewish, consider the unique case of Paul.&nbsp; Unlike the other apostles, Paul was a formally trained Pharisee, and likely knew the Old Testament far better than the other apostles.&nbsp; In the Old Testament, Deuteronomy 6 makes clear that God is one, and Paul would have known this particular verse well:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;4 &ldquo;Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, Paul tells the Colossians, &ldquo;9 For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form.&rdquo; (Colossians 2)&nbsp; In 1 Timothy 3, Paul says, &ldquo;16 By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness:&nbsp; He who was revealed in the flesh, Was vindicated in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Proclaimed among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIt would be unconceivable for a monotheistic Jew, especially a Pharisee like Paul, to view God as some polytheistic being. Rather, Paul effectively states that Jesus is God.&nbsp; Furthermore, Gentile Christians clearly viewed Jesus as God as well.&nbsp; If they saw Jesus as &ldquo;another&rdquo; God, they would not have been persecuted, especially by the Roman emperor.&nbsp; Pagan Gentiles had many gods, and if Jesus were simply one more, Christians would have been accepted.&nbsp; Instead, they saw Jesus as the one true and living God, and for that they were persecuted.</p>\n<p>\n\t(Of course, Scripture has a triune view of God, which we refer to as the Trinity (the Father, Son and Holy Spirit). &nbsp;You can read more about the Trinity in&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/explain_the_trinity/\">this article</a></strong>.)</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking of God, Acts 20:28 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hebrews 9 similarly says of Jesus, &ldquo;11 But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation; 12 and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThus the apostles equate Jesus with God. And Paul says in&nbsp;Titus 2:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 12 instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age, 13 looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, 14 who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tHere again, Jesus is equated with God.&nbsp;Romans 9 states:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;&hellip;5 whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tHebrews 1, quoting Psalm 45, says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;8 But of the Son He says, &ldquo;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, And the righteous scepter is the scepter of His kingdom.&nbsp; 9 &ldquo;You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your companions.&rdquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tPaul and John aren&rsquo;t the only ones claiming Jesus is God.&nbsp; In 2 Peter 1, we read,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tPeter also equates Jesus with the Holy Spirit in 1 Peter 1:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;10 As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries, 11 seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. 12 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven&mdash;things into which angels long to look.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tConfirming the triune nature of God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), Peter says in 2 Peter 1:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;20 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one&rsquo;s own interpretation, 21 for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Holy Spirit is equated with God, and Jesus is equated with the Holy Spirit, making Him equal to God.&nbsp; In Romans 8, Paul similarly equates Jesus with God the Holy Spirit:&nbsp; &ldquo;9 However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.&nbsp; But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tSo, we have more evidence from those who knew Him best that Jesus is God.</p>\n<h4>\n\t<br />\n\tThe Old Testament Testifies to Jesus&rsquo; Deity<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tBefore Jesus was born, the Jews had the blessing and privilege of being given the very word of God.&nbsp; When He became a man, Jesus made an incredible statement about God&rsquo;s word:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me.&rdquo; (John 5:39)&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIs that true?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see.&nbsp;Isaiah 7:14 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThe word &ldquo;Immanuel&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was written about 700 years before Christ&rsquo;s birth. The New Testament agrees:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;22 Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet:&nbsp; 23 &ldquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,&rdquo; which translated means, &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo;&rdquo; (Matthew 1)</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tProphesying of the coming Messiah, Isaiah 9 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;6 For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.&nbsp; 7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore.&nbsp; The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tGod confirms that Jesus is this Son:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, &ldquo;This is My beloved Son, listen to Him!&rdquo;&rdquo; (Mark 9:7)&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThis Son is equated with God the Father, confirming Jesus&rsquo; claim that He and the Father are one.&nbsp;In Isaiah 45, God declares,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;21&hellip; And there is no other God besides Me, A righteous God and a Savior; There is none except Me.&nbsp; 22 &ldquo;Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; For I am God, and there is no other.&nbsp; 23 &ldquo;I have sworn by Myself, The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness And will not turn back, That to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear allegiance.&nbsp; 24 &ldquo;They will say of Me, &lsquo;Only in the Lord are righteousness and strength.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThis is the same description of Christ in the New Testament:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;8 Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. 9 For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, 10 so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&rdquo; (Philippians 2)&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tNotice here that Paul testifies to both Christ&rsquo;s humanity and His Deity.&nbsp;Psalm 110, a Messianic Psalm, also testifies to Jesus&rsquo;s deity:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;The LORD says to my Lord:&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit at My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.&rdquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Jesus applied this Psalm to Himself:&nbsp; &ldquo;41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:&nbsp; 42 &ldquo;What do you think about the Christ, whose son is He?&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;The son of David.&rdquo; 43 He said to them, &ldquo;Then how does David in the Spirit call Him &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; saying, 44 &lsquo;The Lord said to my Lord, &ldquo;Sit at My right hand, Until I put Your enemies beneath Your feet&rdquo;&rsquo;?&nbsp; 45 If David then calls Him &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; how is He his son?&rdquo;&nbsp; 46 No one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIsaiah 44 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;6 &ldquo;Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts:&nbsp; &lsquo;I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Revelation 1, Jesus speaks to John and makes the same claim: &ldquo;17 When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, &ldquo;Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last, 18 and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIn Deuteronomy 32, God is called a Rock:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;3 &ldquo;For I proclaim the name of the Lord; Ascribe greatness to our God!&nbsp; 4 &ldquo;The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is He.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tPaul makes this same connection in 1 Corinthians 10,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea; 2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 3 and all ate the same spiritual food; 4 and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tGenesis 1:1 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tOf Jesus, John says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.&rdquo; (John 1:3)</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIsaiah 43:11 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;I, even I, am the Lord, And there is no savior besides Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; God alone is called the savior, yet the New Testament refers to Jesus as the savior:&nbsp; &ldquo;He is the one whom God exalted to His right hand as a Prince and a Savior, to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; (Acts 5:31)</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tMuch, much more could be said here, but Scripture is clear that the Old Testament testifies to the Deity of Christ.</p>\n<h4>\n\t<br />\n\tJesus&rsquo; Life Testifies to His Deity<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tContinuing our examination of whether or not Jesus is God, we now turn to what He did.&nbsp; If God did appear in the flesh, what would He be like?&nbsp; Surely, He would be able to do things that no mere human could do, including not sinning.&nbsp; He would also know all things (omniscience), He would have power over all things (omnipotence), and be able to be everywhere at once (omnipresence).&nbsp; Does Jesus meet the test?</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst and foremost, Jesus was not like any human.&nbsp; He was born of a human virgin, but His Father was God.&nbsp; Because his father was not human, Jesus was born sinless since He was not in the line of Adam, through whom all people are born sinners.&nbsp; Unlike Adam, Jesus lived a perfect life.&nbsp; Hebrews 4:15 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Peter 2 says, &ldquo;21 For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps, 22 who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tJesus knows all things.&nbsp; Prior to His death and resurrection, He told the Pharisees to destroy the temple of His body and in three days He would raise it up (John 2:19).&nbsp; He knew men&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; Luke 5 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;21 The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, &ldquo;Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?&rdquo; 22 But Jesus, aware of their reasonings, answered and said to them, &ldquo;Why are you reasoning in your hearts?&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tLuke 6 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;7 The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He healed on the Sabbath, so that they might find reason to accuse Him.&nbsp; 8 But He knew what they were thinking, and He said to the man with the withered hand, &ldquo;Get up and come forward!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he got up and came forward.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tSince He created all things, Jesus had power over all things.&nbsp; He controls nature.&nbsp; In Mark 4 we read,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;36 Leaving the crowd, they took Him along with them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him. 37 And there arose a fierce gale of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling up. 38 Jesus Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke Him and said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?&rdquo; 39 And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, &ldquo;Hush, be still.&rdquo; And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tDeuteronomy 32:39 tells us,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;&lsquo;See now that I, I am He, And there is no god besides Me; It is I who put to death and give life. I have wounded and it is I who heal, And there is no one who can deliver from My hand.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tOnly God can give life and put to death, yet Jesus demonstrated this same ability.&nbsp; When Lazarus was sick, Jesus tarried before coming to see him, to ensure he would be dead when He got to him, knowing He would bring him back to life.&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;17 So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days&hellip;.41 So they removed the stone.&nbsp; Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, &ldquo;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.&nbsp; 42 I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; 43 When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lazarus, come forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; 44 The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.&nbsp; Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Unbind him, and let him go.&rdquo;&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tJesus is also omnipresent.&nbsp; Prior to His resurrection, He did not exhibit this power; He claimed it later.&nbsp; Speaking of God, Psalm 139 tells us,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;7 Where can I go from Your Spirit?&nbsp; Or where can I flee from Your presence?&nbsp; 8 If I ascend to heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there.&nbsp; 9 If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, 10 Even there Your hand will lead me, And Your right hand will lay hold of me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tMatthew 18 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;19 &ldquo;Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven.&nbsp; 20 For where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst.&rdquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tMatthew 28 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;&hellip;20 teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tOnly God can be in more than one place at the same time.</p>\n<h4>\n\t<br />\n\tJesus&rsquo; Resurrection Testifies to His Deity<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tJesus predicted His death and His resurrection.&nbsp; In Matthew 26, He says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;31 Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;You will all fall away because of Me this night, for it is written, &lsquo;I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.&rsquo;&nbsp; 32 But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.&rdquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tAs we saw above, only God knows the future, and only God has the power to put to death and to give life.&nbsp; Yet again, Jesus claims this power for Himself.&nbsp; John 10 says, &ldquo;17 For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it again.&nbsp; 18 No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own initiative.&nbsp; I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again.&nbsp; This commandment I received from My Father.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThat Jesus lived and was crucified is a matter of historical record.&nbsp; Even the Jews could not come up with a credible explanation for Jesus&rsquo; resurrection.&nbsp; This is recorded in Matthew 28:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;11 Now while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.&nbsp; 12 And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 13 and said, &ldquo;You are to say, &lsquo;His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.&rsquo;&nbsp; 14 And if this should come to the governor&rsquo;s ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; 15 And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIf Jesus died and stayed dead, surely his scared disciples would not have had the courage to steal His body from Roman soldiers.&nbsp; Surely the Jews would have been able to find a body.&nbsp; They Jews did not even try to find a false cadaver to counter the fact that Jesus rose from the dead; instead, they came up with the story above.</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps one reason why the Jews stuck to their story is that Jesus&rsquo; resurrection was testified to by many witnesses.&nbsp; 1 Corinthians 15 says,</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.&nbsp; 6 After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep; 7 then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles; 8 and last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tOnly God can put to death and give life.</p>\n<h4>\n\t<br />\n\tConclusion<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tGiven the evidence, it&rsquo;s difficult to dismiss the Deity of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; He claimed deity for Himself.&nbsp; His disciples testified to His deity.&nbsp; His life testified to the fact that He was no mere human, but was indeed God.&nbsp; The only logical conclusion is that Jesus is indeed God.&nbsp; This is a comfort for the Christian, and a warning for the unbeliever.&nbsp; We rejoice with the apostle:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!&nbsp; How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!&nbsp; 34 For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who became His counselor?&nbsp; 35 Or who has first given to Him that it might be paid back to him again?&nbsp; 36 For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.&nbsp; To Him be the glory forever.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo; (Romans 11)</h5>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<strong><em>Q. What is happening in Luke 9:27-36? Who are the two men talking with Christ? Were they resurrected?&#8232;</em></strong><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The scene in Luke 9 with Christ, Moses and Elijah is not related in any way to resurrection or even glorification. Here&#39;s the story again:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLuke 9:27 &ldquo;But I say to you truthfully,&nbsp; there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;<br />\n\tLuke 9:28&nbsp; Some eight days after these sayings, He took along&nbsp; Peter and John and James, and&nbsp; went up on the mountain&nbsp; to pray.<br />\n\tLuke 9:29 And while He was&nbsp; praying, the appearance of His face&nbsp; became different, and His clothing became white and&nbsp; gleaming.<br />\n\tLuke 9:30 And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah,<br />\n\tLuke 9:31 who, appearing in&nbsp; glory, were speaking of His&nbsp; departure which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.<br />\n\tLuke 9:32 Now Peter and his companions&nbsp; had been overcome with sleep; but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him.<br />\n\tLuke 9:33 And as&nbsp; these were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, &ldquo; Master, it is good for us to be here;&nbsp; let us make three&nbsp; tabernacles: one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp; not realizing what he was saying.<br />\n\tLuke 9:34 While he was saying this, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.<br />\n\tLuke 9:35 Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &ldquo; This is My Son, My Chosen One; listen to Him!&rdquo;<br />\n\tLuke 9:36 And when the voice&nbsp; had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And&nbsp; they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tNotice that immediately after the Father spoke in v.35, then Jesus is found alone. A moment earlier, two other men were seen standing beside Jesus. Furthermore, notice that the apostles were able to identify these two men as Elijah and Moses even though no one had mentioned their names. Remember, the Apostles could not have known who these men were by appearance, since no paintings or photos of these men existed.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, these two men were not standing in this moment in physical bodies. They were not \"resurrected\" people, much less resurrected Moses or Elijah. Moses and Elijah will not receive new bodies until the resurrection of the Old Testament saints at the end of Tribulation (see Daniel 12:1-2). Furthermore, the rapid appearance and disappearance of these \"men\" suggest they were either visions only or perhaps even angels presenting themselves as Elijah and Moses. Remember, angels commonly appear in the form of men (see Genesis 18).</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, consider the purpose of this moment in the Gospels. Jesus is showing Himself in His future, glorified form, which is the form He will have in the Kingdom. He was giving the Apostles a vision of the future Kingdom, in keeping with His promise from Luke 9:27. So the entire scene is structured as a vision of the future, with Jesus in His future form and Elijah and Moses also reprinted in their future form.<br />\n\tSo these men are not shown in a resurrected, glorified form. This scene is a \"coming attractions\" vision granted to the disciples to give them an understanding of the Kingdom to come. The visions of Elijah and Moses were likely not even these two men in reality but merely images given to the disciples to make a point (similar to the way John experienced visions of future events in Revelation).</p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding the people raised from the dead at the resurrection of Jesus, they were raised in the same way that Lazarus was raised from the dead. These men returned to life in their original bodies, not into new, resurrected, glorified bodies. The purpose in their raising was to witness to the resurrection of the Messiah. Presumably, they lived for a time and then eventually died again (like Lazarus). Again, this situation has no relationship to the resurrection of the Rapture or Tribulation.<br />\n\tRegarding the saints seen in the throne room of Revelation 7, the elders represent the Church saints as we explained earlier. The fact that the full compliment of elders (24) are present in Heaven along with the Seven Spirits of God in Revelation 4 leads us to conclude that the entire church has been raptured into new bodies and is also present in the throne room prior to the start of Tribulation.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy the time we reach Revelation 7, the Tribulation has begun on earth, and of course the Church saints are still in Heaven awaiting Christ&#39;s return. As Tribulation takes place, saints are martyred and enter into Heaven in spirit form only. They do not receive new bodies until the end of Tribulation (see Daniel 12:11-12).<br />\n\t<br />\n\tSo while they are in Heaven, they can be seen and share the company of the Church Saints, but they do not have new bodies yet. They live in Heaven in the same way Church saints who die today live in Heaven prior to the Rapture: in spirit form only. We see both the Church and the martyred saints of Tribulation represented in Heaven. The church saints are represented by their elders, while the martyred saints are seen in spirit form under the altar in Revelation 6 and again at the end of chapter 7.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<strong><em>Q. What is the significance of the \"daylight\" mentioned in John chapter 11? Why does John refer to daylight as 12 hours?</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tA. In John 11, Jesus says:</p>\n<h5>\n\tJohn 11:7 Then after this He said to the disciples, &ldquo; Let us go to Judea again.&rdquo;<br />\n\tJohn 11:8 The disciples said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking&nbsp; to stone You, and are You going there again?&rdquo;<br />\n\tJohn 11:9 Jesus answered, &ldquo; Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.<br />\n\tJohn 11:10 &ldquo;But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&rdquo;<br />\n\tJohn 11:11 This He said, and after that He&nbsp; said to them, &ldquo;Our&nbsp; friend Lazarus&nbsp; has fallen asleep; but I go, so that I may awaken him out of sleep.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tWe need to note the details of this parable carefully to understand Jesus&#39; teaching. FIrst, He makes a comparison between someone walking in the day by the light of the sun. That person will walk confidently because his path is illuminated by the sun. The man&#39;s walking ability hasn&#39;t improved, but because he has the benefit of the sun&#39;s light, he can walk without fear.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, if that man walks at night without the presence of the sun, then he does have reason to worry. The path will be dark, and he will likely stumble and harm himself. Notice Jesus says that the man doesn&#39;t have the light inside himself. He can&#39;t produce light by himself. He depends on the light of the sun to make his walk successful. If he proceeds without the sun, he risks harm.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow let&#39;s apply that parable to the situation of Lazarus and the disciples&#39; concern about Jesus going to Jerusalem. The disciples say they are worried for Jesus. They say if He goes to Jerusalem, He may be killed, but Jesus knows their hearts. Jesus knows they are worried for themselves as much as they are for Him. They are His disciples, and therefore they risk persecution as well. So, they try to convince Jesus not to go.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus tells the parable to explain why they have nothing to fear. If they go to Jerusalem with Jesus (Who is pictured by the sun), then they will have nothing to fear. Like the sun protects us from stumbling, Jesus will protect them from stumbling. If they were to go without Him (i.e., to walk in the dark), then they would have reason to fear the consequences.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus&#39; mention of \"12 hours\" of light refers to the limited time Jesus will accompany these men in the flesh. After a time, Jesus knew He would leave the earth and then the daylight will come to an end and a night will fall upon the earth. We can see this same principle reflected in another part of the Gospels:</p>\n<h5>\n\tJohn 9:4 &ldquo;We must work the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day; night is coming when no one can work.<br />\n\tJohn 9:5 &ldquo;While I am in the world, I am&nbsp; the Light of the world.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 9:14&nbsp; Then the disciples of John&nbsp; came to Him, asking, &ldquo;Why do we and&nbsp; the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?&rdquo;<br />\n\tMatt. 9:15 And Jesus said to them, &ldquo;The&nbsp; attendants of the bridegroom cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tJesus compares His time on the earth to \"day\" and the time following His death and resurrection to \"night,\" when the world will wait for the return of the Light of the world. So as long as Jesus was in the world, He was the Light of the world, and while we await His return, the world remains in a period of spiritual darkness. Though the Gospel is being proclaimed and the light of God&#39;s grace is shining in hearts of believers, nevertheless the world persists in a state of spiritual darkness awaiting Jesus&#39; return.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Jesus uses the daylight (or daytime) as a picture of His physical presence in the world, and His notes that there are only \"12 hours\" of daylight to emphasize that His presence on earth was to be for a limited time. Just as the daytime only last so long (12 hours) and then night comes, so was Jesus&#39; time on Earth. He was present for a time, and then He left for a time.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the time Jesus was on earth (i.e., while it was \"day\"), then the disciples would benefit from His protection over them. They could walk with Him and enjoy Him and not fear. But when Jesus&#39; time on earth was gone, then His disciples would mourn and darkness would come and they must be careful (<em>see Luke 22:35-37</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in summary, Jesus was telling the disciples that as long as Jesus was with them, they were to walk in His light, following Him without fear, knowing He was leading them in security while He did the work of the Father. Only after Jesus left the earth would they have reason to fear.</p>"

In his <a href=\"/bible-studies/the-gospel-of-john\">Gospel, John</a> records three Passovers. These three Passovers occur in the three years of Jesus&#39; earthly ministry. John alone recorded the three separate Passover celebrations. John mentions the first in John 2, the second Passover in 6:4 and the third one in 11:55; 12:1; 13:1; 18:28, 39; and 19:14. This third Passover was the one that occurred on the night before Jesus died, and it is the one recorded by all four Gospel writers in conjunction with the Last Supper and the death of Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>The first Passover is only recorded in John&#39;s Gospel, and it may have been the Passover of April 18, AD&nbsp;29, the first year of&nbsp;Jesus&#39; public ministry. Jesus always celebrated the Passover because He was a Jew who obeyed the Mosaic Law (Deut. 16:1-8), in keeping with His mission to fulfill the Law.</p>\n\n<p>In his account of that first Passover, John records Jesus running out the money changers:</p>\n\n<h5>John 2:12&nbsp; After this He went down to&nbsp; Capernaum, He and His&nbsp; mother and His&nbsp; brothers and His&nbsp; disciples; and they stayed there a few days.<br />\nJohn 2:13&nbsp; The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus&nbsp; went up to Jerusalem.<br />\nJohn 2:14&nbsp; And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated at their tables.<br />\nJohn 2:15 And He made a scourge of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables;<br />\nJohn 2:16 and to those who were selling&nbsp; the doves He said, &ldquo;Take these things away; stop making&nbsp; My Father&rsquo;s house a&nbsp; place of business.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 2:17 His&nbsp; disciples remembered that it was written, &ldquo; ZEAL FOR YOUR HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Compare this account to <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_luke\">Luke&#39;s account</a> of Jesus&#39;s doing the same thing two years later:</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 19:45&nbsp; Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling,<br />\nLuke 19:46 saying to them, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo; AND MY HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER,&rsquo;&nbsp; but you have made it a ROBBERS&rsquo;&nbsp; DEN.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>We know this incident is different than the first for two reasons. First, Jesus&#39; words are different in Luke&#39;s account than in the first incident recorded in John 2. Secondly, John&#39;s Gospel records his incident in Jesus&#39; first visit to Jerusalem on Passover, while Luke records it during Jesus&#39; third Passover visit.</p>\n\n<p>We should have no problem with the thought that Jesus repeated His actions in the temple, and therefore two different Gospel writers record it in two different moments. If seeing money changers in the temple grounds angered Jesus once, it stands to reason it always make Him angry.</p>"

Why do some Christian teachers and pastors become prideful in their knowledge and how does this affect their ministry?</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tA. Pride is often at the root of many of our sinful actions. It causes us to think of ourselves as better than others. Our sinful nature is one of pride and arrogance and we are warned against this throughout scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough Christian pastors, teachers and theologians are knowledgeable of things of God, they are still susceptible to the same temptations and sins as everyone else. Sometimes, great knowledge and talent can increase the temptation to become arrogant. The parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector in Luke 18:9-14 is a great example of Bible scholars in that day who viewed themselves as better than others because of the knowledge they possessed. God warned against this.</p>\n<h5>\n\tLuke 18:9-14 - To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: &ldquo;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: &lsquo;God, I thank you that I am not like other people&mdash;robbers, evildoers, adulterers&mdash;or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&rsquo;</h5>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, &lsquo;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&rsquo;<br />\n\t&ldquo;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tPride hardens the mind and causes us to reject the wisdom of God. Worldly knowledge without Godly wisdom can often lead us to sinful motives and thoughts and cause us to think of ourselves as better than others. However, as followers of Christ, we are called to live a life of humility, just as Christ did.</p>\n<p>\n\tPhil. 2:3 &ndash; Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others better than yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interest of others.&rdquo;</p>"

Chastisement is the word musar in Hebrew and it means to discipline. You can see an example of its in the following scriptures:</p>\n<h5>\n\tHos. 5:2 The revolters have gone deep in depravity,<br />\n\tBut I will chastise all of them.</h5>\n<h5>\n\tJer. 31:18 &ldquo;I have surely heard Ephraim grieving,<br />\n\t&lsquo;You have&nbsp; chastised me, and I was chastised,<br />\n\tLike an untrained&nbsp; calf;<br />\n\t&nbsp; Bring me back that I may be restored,<br />\n\tFor You are the LORD my God.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe concept of chastisement carries with it the purpose of restoration. Chastisement is the process of discipling rebellion until it ends and obedience is restored, such as a parent discipling a child for its own good. This is the way the Lord works with His children, according to Hebrews 10.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are many examples of chastisement in the Bible. The Lord chastises Jacob while in service to Laban. Joseph chastises his brothers in Egypt. The Lord chastises David for his sin with Bathsheba.&nbsp; Jesus chastised Peter at times. Paul chastised the church in Corinth.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe most powerful example of chastisement in the Bible is the way the Lord chastises the nation of Israel over the course of its history. The Lord&#39;s discipline eventually leads Israel back to faithfulness at the end of the age.</p>"

The baptism John performed in the days prior to Jesus&#39; ministry was a baptism of repentance.</p>\n<h5>\n\tMark 1:4 John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.<br />\n\tMark 1:5 And all the country of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</h5>\n<p>\n\tJohn&#39;s baptism was a call in keeping with the words of the prophet Isaiah:</p>\n<h5>\n\tIs. 40:3&nbsp;&nbsp; A voice is calling,<br />\n\t&ldquo; Clear the way for the LORD in the wilderness;<br />\n\tMake smooth in the desert a highway for our God.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Isaiah, John&#39;s call for repentance within Israel was intended to prepare hearts for the Messiah&#39;s arrival. His baptism was a call for repentance unto salvation (i.e., capital \"R\" as Pastor Armstrong teaches), but forgiveness for sins is made possible only through faith in Christ. Salvation has never been offered through the sacrifices of the OT Law:</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 10:4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</h5>\n<p>\n\tNo man has ever been forgiven of sins through the sacrifices of the Law. Only faith in God&#39;s provision of a Messiah brought forgiveness of sins and salvation. As Paul taught:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 3:19&nbsp; Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are&nbsp; under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and&nbsp; all the world may become accountable to God;<br />\n\tRom. 3:20 because&nbsp; by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.<br />\n\tRom. 3:21 But now apart&nbsp; from the Law&nbsp; the righteousness of God has been manifested, being&nbsp; witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,<br />\n\tRom. 3:22 even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tTherefore, those who came to John in the wilderness for baptism were receiving forgiveness of sins because they were trusting in God&#39;s promise of a Messiah. They received water baptism as a sign of their repentance and their faith in God&#39;s promised Anointed One. Their faith saved them, not their baptism.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, men and women are saved in the same way. We have faith in God&#39;s Anointed One, Jesus Christ, our Messiah, and because of our faith we receive water baptism to symbolize our repentance hearts and our new life through faith in Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow did the people in John&#39;s day understand these things? In the same way we understand them today: by studying God&#39;s word. The Jewish scriptures (i.e., the OT) testifies to the sin of every man, the requirement for repentance, the need to appeal for God&#39;s mercy and forgiveness, and the atonement God would provide through the Messiah. In John&#39;s day, the promise of a Messiah had yet to be fulfilled, while in our day, the promise has been fulfilled. In both cases, however, faith in God&#39;s provision was the means of forgiveness and salvation.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven John himself was an OT saint saved by his faith in the coming Messiah, and when Jesus began his ministry, John sought to confirm the Messiah&#39;s arrival:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLuke 7:18&nbsp; The disciples of John reported to him about all these things.<br />\n\tLuke 7:19 Summoning&nbsp; two of his disciples, John sent them to&nbsp; the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Are You the&nbsp; Expected One, or do we look for someone else?&rdquo;<br />\n\tLuke 7:20 When the men came to Him, they said, &ldquo;John the Baptist has sent us to You, to ask, &lsquo;Are You the&nbsp; Expected One, or do we look for someone else?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />\n\tLuke 7:21 At that&nbsp; very time He&nbsp; cured many people of diseases and&nbsp; afflictions and evil spirits; and He gave sight to many who were blind.<br />\n\tLuke 7:22 And He answered and said to them, &ldquo;Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the&nbsp; BLIND RECEIVE SIGHT, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the&nbsp; POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tSo those who responded to John&#39;s call of repentance were those who had faith in God&#39;s promise, and they wished to demonstrate their faith by receiving the baptism John offered.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe recommend our Romans and Exodus studies if you are interested in learning more about the relationship between grace and law in scripture.

Jesus is not talking about literal sheep or shepherds, nor is He talking about literal thieves stealing things. He is speaking about the Kingdom of God and how Jesus protects believers from all things, including from those who make false claims and attempt to deceive Christ&#39;s followers.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, Jesus says that He is the door, the one way by which we may enter into eternal life. Before Jesus came, there were others who came claiming to be the Messiah, but these false messiahs were merely \"thieves\" trying to steal Christ&#39;s glory. Because they were not truly the Messiah, God&#39;s children (i.e., the sheep) did not hear them.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo notice that the thief in this passage is not the Devil. In this analogy, Jesus says that the earlier false messiahs were the thieves. Certainly, these false prophets were working under Satan&#39;s direction, but it is incorrect to say that the thief in John 10:10 is the Devil. In fact, it is the one who falsely claims to be Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, notice that this is not a passage talking about when people die or how people die or if the Devil can cause someone to die or any of those things. This passage is not talking about living or dying at all. To take this passage and use it to support the notion that Satan is taking the lives of children is grossly improper, completely inaccurate, and a woefully ignorant use of scripture. To repeat,: Jesus was not talking about anyone dying.</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead, Jesus was talking about salvation. He was explaining that when the real Messiah arrived on earth, the people appointed to salvation heard His voice and followed Him into eternal life. They followed Him because God&#39;s people will always know the truth about God. Others have come into the world trying to deceive people into following them as if they were Christ (these were the thieves), but they could not steal Jesus&#39; sheep. His sheep know Him and will follow Him.</p>"

Furthermore, Paul says plainly:</p>\n<h5>\n\tCol. 3:9&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices</h5>\n<p>\n\tAnd James says:</p>\n<h5>\n\tJames 3:2 For we all stumble in many ways.

The same sin can be committed through our written words. Therefore, if a Christian is misrepresenting themselves through written words for any purpose, they are sinning by deception or lying.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile we cannot anticipate all the repercussions of lying, we know the Lord will hold us accountable at the Judgment Seat of Christ. This judgment will not threaten our salvation, as Paul teaches in 1Corinthians 3, but it will assign eternal reward, and that reward can be jeopardized by our failure to serve the Lord well.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you would like to read more about this area of scripture, we recommend the following article:<br />\n\t<em>\"<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/can_someone_continue_in_sin_and_still_be_saved/\" target=\"_blank\">Can someone continue in sin and still be saved?</a>\"</em></p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. My spouse is an unbeliever. I often struggle over our differences, but I remain committed to our marriage hoping the Lord will bring my spouse to faith one day. In the meantime, what does the Bible say about how I should approach my marriage? How do I live my faith while honoring my marriage?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Living with an unbelieving spouse is a challenge. Often it means a marriage with different goals, driven by your faith and your spouse&#39;s ignorance of biblical truth. These challenges can be very difficult and cause significant stress in a marriage (in addition to the \"normal\" stresses every marriage encounters). Nevertheless, the believer is called to live in union with their spouse despite these differences, and the Bible offers copious advice to the believer for how to approach the situation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>First, Paul addresses this very topic in 1Corinthians. The church in Corinth asked him how to handle marriages between believers and unbelievers, and in his response, Paul emphasizes the importance of remaining committed to an unbelieving spouse and the necessity of living in peace:</p>\n\n<h5>1 Corinthians 7: 12 -16 - To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. 13 And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. 14 For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. 15 But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. 16 How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>By no means is this a simple task. Rather, living with an unbelieving spouse requires complete dependence on the Lord and His wisdom. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you face the daily challenge of living with a mate who doesn&rsquo;t share your deepest spiritual commitments: &#8232;</p>\n\n<p>1. Commit yourself to praying for God&rsquo;s word to penetrate your spouse&#39;s heart and that God will use you as an instrument in your spouse&#39;s understanding of God.</p>\n\n<h5>Philippians 4:6-7- Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\n2. Be patient and show grace to your spouse.</p>\n\n<h5>Colossians 4:5-6 - Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. 6 Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\n3. Be the hands and feet of Christ in your marriage. Commit yourself to serving your spouse out of love and respect.</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:10 - For we are God&rsquo;s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.<br />\n<br />\nGalatians 5:13 - You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>Philippians 4:8-9 - Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable&mdash;if anything is excellent or praiseworthy&mdash;think about such things. 9 Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me&mdash;put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>1 Peter 3: 1-6 - Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, 2 when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. 3 Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. 4 Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God&rsquo;s sight. 5 For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands, 6 like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>4. Check your heart and motives toward your spouse.</p>\n\n<p>Second to God, are you putting your spouse and marriage first? Is your relationship with Christ making you a more enjoyable person to live with &ndash; or just a more religious one? These are important questions because our eagerness to study the Bible, serve the Lord and minister to others can come at the expense of someone else. This does not mean we are to stop seeking God&rsquo;s truth. But, we are called be aware and sensitive to the needs of others, especially our spouse.</p>\n\n<h5>Phil. 2:3-4 Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, 4 not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Are you showing gentleness and respect to your spouse?</p>\n\n<h5>1 Peter 3:15-17 But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, 16 keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. 17 For it is better, if it is God&rsquo;s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>5. Remember that God is the one who is at work in you and in your spouse.</p>\n\n<h5>Phil. 2:13 for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>6. Refrain from being judgmental of your spouse&#39;s reasons for questioning the Bible or your relationship with God.</p>\n\n<p>Matthew 7:1 says we are not to judge others. Matthew is not talking about judging which actions are righteous and unrighteous, but rather the heart of people&rsquo;s actions. Instead of judging, try to understand what it is that holds your spouse back and then pray for God to remove those barriers.<br />\n<br />\nPray for God to take your spouse on a spiritual journey that you are very much a part of. As we just read in 1Corinthians 7, how are we to know if we will save our spouse? God tells us to find a way to live in peace for His glory.</p>"

The Bible places no&nbsp;requirements for age on marriage. Since the Bible is silent on this concern, all believers have liberty in this area. Any man may marry any woman of any age so long as both are old enough to enter into marriage (by law and custom) and both have consented to the marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Some cultures hold that women may not marry younger men, but this is not God&#39;s requirement nor is it found in scripture. This is a man-made cultural requirement only. Some even misuse and misinterpret&nbsp;scripture to mislead both men and women on this issue. For example, some teach that since Adam was created first then the man in every marriage must always be older than his wife, but this is not proper interpretation of scripture.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible never suggests that because Adam was created first that the man in every marriage should be older. This is a ridiculous and illogical conclusion. If we hold that our marriages must mimic Adam and Woman&#39;s marriage in every respect, then by the same logic&nbsp;we must could conclude that a man should only marry a woman created from his own rib! Clearly, this is faulty logic.</p>\n\n<p>Proper interpretation of scripture must distinguish between prescription and description. The creation story of Man and Woman is descriptive. It describes how these two came into being, however this story is not prescriptive. It does not prescribe how all marriages will begin.

If so, then she was demonstrating the truth that Peter taught:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Pet. 2:20 For if, after they have&nbsp; escaped the defilements of the world by&nbsp; the knowledge of the&nbsp; Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again&nbsp; entangled in them and are overcome,&nbsp; the last state has become worse for them than the first.<br />\n\t2Pet. 2:21&nbsp; For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from&nbsp; the holy commandment&nbsp; handed on to them.<br />\n\t2Pet. 2:22&nbsp; It has happened to them according to the true proverb, &ldquo; A DOG RETURNS TO ITS OWN VOMIT,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;A sow, after washing, returns to wallowing in the mire.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn the first example, the Bible teaches that believers can - and do - stray from the Lord. In their disobedience, their life can resemble the life of an unbeliever. These children of God may even deny the Lord, much as Peter denied Christ during His trial. These denials are, in fact, lies just as Peter&#39;s denials were lies. Though it may be hard to accept, a true believer may claim to be otherwise, may sin in egregious ways and make every effort to distance themselves from Christ in this life.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as Paul wrote:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 8:38 For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,<br />\n\tRom. 8:39 nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from&nbsp; the love of God, which is&nbsp; in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn the second example, the Bible teaches that people can portray themselves as Christians in a convincing way, even to themselves. These portrayals include confessions of faith, the appearance of godly living, and even a degree of Biblical knowledge and piety. The Pharisees of Christ&#39;s day are the best example of this kind of counterfeit religious observance.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, such impostors were never truly born again as one of God&#39;s children. The missing ingredient was saving faith. The Bible says that saving faith is a gift of God, not something men acquire for themselves:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 2:8 For&nbsp; by grace you have been saved&nbsp; through faith; and&nbsp; that not of yourselves, it is&nbsp; the gift of God;<br />\n\tEph. 2:9&nbsp; not as a result of works, so that&nbsp; no one may boast.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThis is the \"gift of salvation\" you mentioned. Saving faith itself is a gift, and once it comes to a person, they confess and believe are are saved forever. The gift comes with the power of the Holy Spirit, Who indwells the person permanently as a down payment on the eternal inheritance God has granted to the believer:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Cor. 1:21 Now He who&nbsp; establishes us with you in Christ and&nbsp; anointed us is God,<br />\n\t2Cor. 1:22 who also&nbsp; sealed us and&nbsp; gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a&nbsp; pledge.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 4:30&nbsp; Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,&nbsp; by whom you were&nbsp; sealed for the day of redemption.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, while we cannot say what happens to someone upon death, we can caution anyone from arriving at a doctrinal understanding through an analysis of any one person&#39;s life. Since unbelievers can act like believers and believers can act like unbelievers, we cannot rely on such observations to form conclusions about the truth of salvation.</p>"

The Biblical model for raising leadership in the church is provided in numerous places in the New Testament, but perhaps the clearest example is provided in Paul&#39;s letter to Timothy:</p>\n<h5>\n\tTitus 1:5&nbsp; For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPaul tells Timothy (a man Paul himself elevated into leadership) to appoint elders in churches. By Paul&#39;s example, we see clearly that existing church leaders can and should install other leaders over congregations. These appointments should be done in recognition of the Spirit&#39;s call and anointing, as Paul acknowledged in Timothy:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Tim. 4:5 &nbsp;But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, we never hear in scripture of leaders being elected in any church body, though that practice is common in churches today. The absence of such an example in the Bible doesn&#39;t necessarily invalidate the use of congregational elections, but it should lead to doubts concerning its legitimacy. Certainly, the Lord can (and does) work through many styles of church government, including congregational styles, but given the absence of congregational election in scripture, we caution against its use.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe should remember that the condemned, apostate church of the Last Days, as represented by the church of Laodicea in Revelation 3, is said to be a church where the people rule over the church. The last days church is apostate, in part, because of its democratic style of governance, where the \"sheep\" rule over the shepherd demanding that the shepherd tickle ears. The congregational style of governance makes possible such corruption on a wide scale, bringing about the great falling away Paul predicts in his letters. (For more on this teaching, please consult our <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/\">Revelation</a></strong> study.)</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, we believe that new church leadership should be selected from among men called and anointed by the Holy Spirit and ordained by existing elders. These men may assume ministry opportunities as the Lord directs.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor more teaching on this topic of church leadership, we recommend the following resources:</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/presbuteros_episkopos_diakonos/\"><strong>Presbuteros, Episkopos, Diakonos</strong></a></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/pastor_accountability/\">Pastor Accountability</a></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/restoring_gods_people/\"><strong>Restoring God&#39;s People - A Study in Ezra &amp; Nehemiah</strong></a></p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. I never celebrated Easter or Christmas growing up as I was taught these holidays have pagan origins that have nothing to do with Christ. I am getting married this year and my fiance celebrates both holidays. How should we approach this issue?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. We&#39;ll begin by expanding on what we wrote&nbsp;in our&nbsp;<a href=\"/devotionals/should-i-celebrate-halloween\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; font-weight: bold; \">article on Halloween</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>In Col 2:16-17, Paul tells the believers in Colossae they should let no one be their \"judge\" concerning festivals. The word for judge in the Greek is&nbsp;<em style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">krino</em>, which in this context carries a negative connotation (<em style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">i.e</em>., to condemn). For comparison, see the same word used in Luke 6:36; John 3:17, 5:22, 7:51; and Acts 13:27.</p>\n\n<p>So, Paul instructs that we should not allow anyone to condemn us simply because we choose to observe or not observe a festival that honors the Lord in some way. Paul says such things are meaningless with respect to our righteousness. We cannot be made more righteous by avoiding festivals nor are we unrighteous because we join in them.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"Christmas\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/christmas-tree-inside-the-house.jpg\" style=\"margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 5px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; \" width=\"504\" /></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, your choice to observe or forgo these celebrations has no bearing on your standing before God, because liberty in Christ permits us to act as we feel led when it comes to trivial matters like these.</p>\n\n<p>Paul explains that these festivals are meaningless because in verse 2:17 he calls these things \"shadows\", which means they are merely abstract representations of Christ intended to remind us of Him and His work. Once the substance appeared (<em style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">i.e</em>., Christ was revealed in teh flesh), the shadows God had appointed for men to observe no longer had any significance or meaning by themselves. This is why Christians are not obligated to observe the Jewish festivals in the Mosaic Law.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Christmas, we know the holiday had pagan origins, yet today those origins have been set aside and the holiday marks Christ&#39;s birth. Knowing the intent of the holiday is now to honor Christ, we can choose to observe Christmas if we wish. Similarly, the Easter holiday marks His death and resurrection, so we can observe that holiday for its intended purpose. On the other hand, we are not required to do so and may freely ignore these events if we wish.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the holidays simply have no bearing on our obedient relationship with Christ. We are free to ignore Christmas and Easter or to celebrate them as we wish without fear of condemnation in either case. Again, a Christian has liberty to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in his or her own walk concerning meaningless issues, without regard for how other Christians choose to act under similar circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your relationship with your future wife, perhaps a useful question to consider in prayer with her is&nbsp;<em style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">why</em>&nbsp;you would or would not chose to celebrate a given holiday? As I mentioned in the earlier article on Halloween, there could be good reasons to go either way. For example, by abstaining from the holidays you might believe you could improve your witness to certain unbelievers who have misunderstood the holiday.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason to refrain from celebrating the holidays might be to accommodate a friend or family member who is struggling with the celebration in some way. Since the holiday is meaningless with respect to your own righteousness, you might forgo the event out of love for that person. On the other hand, we could determine that observing the holiday (in an appropriate way) would be a useful witness tool for neighbors or it could it be useful for teaching our children about the Lord.</p>\n\n<p>So, here&#39;s my suggestion: take each year as they come. Just because you choose to celebrate Christmas one year doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t choose to ignore it the next year. The same goes for Easter or any other event you have reservations about. Christians are supposed to be led by the Spirit and not by rules written on stone in every aspect of our lives, so why feel the need to set a single, unchanging rule for your family? Instead, allow the Holy Spirit the opportunity to guide you in this decision as with any other.</p>\n\n<p>Pray with your future wife over what the Lord wants you to do as a family with each holiday. Be open-minded. Test your assumptions to be sure your flesh is not the thing drawing you toward a holiday or repelling you from it. Finally, do what God tells you, for to do otherwise is sin (Romans 14:23)!</p>\n\n<p>In fact, we&nbsp;can&#39;t think of a better way to express your Christian witness than being willing to move freely between observing and abstaining from holidays on the basis of what&#39;s best for your family and most effective as a Christian witness. By doing so, you will be demonstrating the power and freedom that comes with liberty in Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Not only might your unbelieving friends experience the love of Christ, but even your Christian friends could learn something about what freedom in Christ is all about. Another thing to con- sider is your views about a given holiday could change over time, leading to a change in what you want to do. So, be Spirit-led, not rule-driven.</p>\n\n<p>As a postscript to this discussion, remember that the husband in a marriage has the responsibility, according to scripture, to provide spiritual leadership in the home. Therefore, if you and your fiance remain in disagreement over this issue come the next holiday, then it falls to you to decide the issue and then for the family to support your decision. However, the husband is to honor and cherish his wife, placing her needs above his own (Ephesians 5:25), so be sure to give greater consideration to her needs and desires than to your own.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<strong><em>Q. How does God discipline His children and what does this look like?</em></strong><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Simply put, the Lord&#39;s discipline can take virtually any form. The particular form discipline may take is less important than the lesson it teaches us. Anytime the Lord brings discipline into our lives, He will also bring Spirit-given insight to ensure we understand the lesson. As we seek the Lord in prayer and through study of His word, we will receive the Spirit&#39;s counsel and come to understand the Lord&#39;s purpose in the trial.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, when Paul was afflicted by the Lord, he sought to understand his affliction and the Lord answered him:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Cor. 12:7 Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me &mdash; to keep me from exalting myself!<br />\n\t2Cor. 12:8 Concerning this I implored the Lord&nbsp; three times that it might leave me.<br />\n\t2Cor. 12:9 And He has said to me, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is perfected in weakness.&rdquo; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast&nbsp; about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tNotice that Paul was afflicted first, then he implored the Lord to remove the trial, and finally the Lord responded with understand so Paul could learn the lesson. In Paul&#39;s case, the Lord was concerned about Paul&#39;s pride. Since Paul was granted such extraordinary revelation, the Lord chose to afflict Paul as a reminder that he needed the Lord&#39;s strength to succeed. This is the Lord&#39;s purpose in bringing discipline in any form.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as the Lord chastises us, we can expect He will also \"connect the dots\" for us so that we may understand and appreciate the purpose in the trial. Then it falls to us to receive that discipline, learn the lesson and profit from it.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<b><i>Q. You teach that Daniel 9:25 gives us a timeline for Christ&#39;s Second Coming that begins with the rebuilding of Jerusalem&#39;s wall, but others say this verse teaches the timeline begins with a re-establishment of Israel&#39;s justice system. How do I know which interpretation is correct</i></b><b><i>?</i></b><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. First, let&#39;s look at Daniel 9:25:</p>\n<h5>\n\tDan. 9:25 &ldquo;So you are to know and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe issue in question is when do we begin counting the \"seven weeks and sixty-two weeks?\" The verse says we should begin the timeline when something is rebuilt, specifically Jerusalem and its wall and plaza. As you say, some teach that it is not the wall that begins the timeline but the re-establishment of the Jewish courts of justice operating in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe question centers around a single Hebrew word in Daniel 9:25. The Hebrew word used for wall (or moat) is <em>charuts</em>, which can be translated in one of three ways depending on context. First, it can mean a judgment or decision, as used in Joel 3:12-14.</p>\n<h5>\n\tJoel 3:12 Let the nations be aroused<br />\n\tAnd come up to the&nbsp; valley of&nbsp; Jehoshaphat,<br />\n\tFor there I will sit to&nbsp; judge<br />\n\tAll the surrounding nations.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tJoel 3:13&nbsp; Put in the sickle, for the&nbsp; harvest is ripe.<br />\n\tCome,&nbsp; tread, for the&nbsp; wine press is full;<br />\n\tThe vats overflow, for their&nbsp; wickedness is great.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, it can mean gold, as in the last word used in Psalm 68:13:</p>\n<h5>\n\tPsa. 68:13&nbsp; When you lie down among the sheepfolds,<br />\n\tYou are like the wings of a dove covered with silver,<br />\n\tAnd its pinions with glistening gold.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tLastly, it can mean a wall or barrier (like a moat) as it has been translated in Daniel 9:25 by all English Bibles.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhich one of these three possible translations should be used for Daniel 9:25? We can answer the question by trying each option in the context of the verse and checking the result. What is the context of Daniela 9:25? Clearly, the overall context of Daniel 9:25 is speaking of a construction project. Jerusalem is being rebuilt, and several features of the city are described. I</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that context in mind, we see that it (i.e., Jerusalem) will be rebuilt with a plaza (i.e., an open space) and a <em>charuts</em>. So whatever charuts means, it must refer to something that is built in the same sense (and timeframe) as the rest of Jerusalem. Now let&#39;s consider each of the three possible meanings of this Hebrew word in that context.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, Jerusalem will be rebuilt with plaza and gold. This is logically possible, but historically we know that Jerusalem was not, in fact, built with gold. It was built with stone and wood, like any other city of that day. So the word can&#39;t mean gold.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, Jerusalem will be rebuilt with plaza and decision (or judgment). This statement makes no grammatical nor logical sense. The word must describe the building of the city itself. Notice that the first word is plaza, which describes a physical feature of the city, and therefore the second word would logically also pertain to a physical feature of the building. Interpreting the word to mean judgment or decision does not follow naurally from the context.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, we can interpret the word as wall (or moat or barrier), and in doing so we arrive at a conclusion that is accurate to the context and accurate to history. You can learn much more about this prophecy in Daniel and how to accurately interpret the prophecy in chapter 9 by listening to our Revelation series, especially Lesson 5C, found here:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/revelation_2011_lesson_5c/\">Revelation - Lesson 5C</a></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Note: The accompanying visual aids in Lesson 5C are also very helpful in understanding the teaching.</em></p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<strong><em>Q. What is the context of Ezekiel 36:25? Was Ezekiel speaking of water baptism?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tA. In the case of Ezekiel 36:25, it is important to understand exactly what Ezekiel was describing and whether it relates to baptism.&nbsp; Was Ezekiel speaking of water baptism or of something else?</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider the context of that quote:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEzek. 36:22 &ldquo;Therefore say to the house of Israel, &lsquo;Thus says the Lord GOD, &ldquo;It is&nbsp; not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.<br />\n\tEzek. 36:23 &ldquo;I will&nbsp; vindicate the holiness of My great name which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst. Then the&nbsp; nations will know that I am the LORD,&rdquo; declares the Lord GOD, &ldquo;when I prove Myself holy among you in their sight.<br />\n\tEzek. 36:24 &ldquo;For I will&nbsp; take you from the nations, gather you from all the lands and bring you into your own land.<br />\n\tEzek. 36:25 &ldquo;Then I will&nbsp; sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your&nbsp; filthiness and from all your&nbsp; idols.<br />\n\tEzek. 36:26 &ldquo;Moreover, I will give you a&nbsp; new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the&nbsp; heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.<br />\n\tEzek. 36:27 &ldquo;I will&nbsp; put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn this chapter, Ezekiel records the Lord&#39;s words spoken to the nation of Israel. The Lord said He was prepared to act to bring Israel back to Himself in a future day. In that future day, the Lord says He will regather Israel from among the nations where they have been scattered, which is a reference to the current regathering that is taking place in Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext, the Lord says He will vindicate His name among the nations of the world, so that the world will come to know that the God of Israel is the true, living God, holy in all His ways. Once the nation of Israel in in the land, the Lord will accomplish three things for Israel. First, He will sprinkle them with clean water, so that they will no longer have any sin nor ever again turn from the Lord to worship idols. Secondly, He will give each Jew a \"new heart\" and \"new spirit\" so they will have hearts to have faith in the Lord forever. Finally, He will put His Spirit within them so they will obey Him and walk in His commandments forever.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we consider these statements, notice that each refers to spiritual outcomes. The sprinkling of water describes the removal of sin, the new heart symbolizes coming to faith, and the placing of God&#39;s Spirit refers to an obedient walk. The Lord is speaking about the way He will bring salvation to the nation of Israel in the last days of Tribulation, immediately before the Millennial Kingdom. (You can learn more about this event in our Isaiah or Revelation studies on our website.) So Ezekiel 36:25 is a spiritual statement describing Israel&#39;s justification by faith resulting in the removal of Israel&#39;s sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy our analysis of the context, it becomes immediately clear that Ezekiel was NOT prescribing a method for Christian baptism. In fact, he was not speaking of baptism at all.&nbsp; The mere fact that God used the term \"sprinkling water\" poetically to refer to removing Israel&#39;s sin does not permit us to twist the meaning of the passage to explain how believers perform water baptism.&nbsp; As we demonstrated, Ezekiel was speaking solely about God&#39;s plan of salvation for Israel, and in that context he used the term \"sprinkling\" in an entirely different (and unrelated) context. So, Ezekiel&#39;s teaching has nothing to say whatsoever about the proper method for Christian baptism.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, other texts found in the New Testament DO offer clear instruction on the manner and purpose of baptism. For example, Paul taught:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 6:1&nbsp; What shall we say then? Are we to&nbsp; continue in sin so that grace may increase?<br />\n\tRom. 6:2&nbsp; May it never be! How shall we who&nbsp; died to sin still live in it?<br />\n\tRom. 6:3 Or do you not know that all of us who have been&nbsp; baptized into&nbsp; Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?<br />\n\tRom. 6:4 Therefore we have been&nbsp; buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was&nbsp; raised from the dead through the&nbsp; glory of the Father, so we too might walk in&nbsp; newness of life.<br />\n\tRom. 6:5 For&nbsp; if we have become&nbsp; united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be&nbsp; in the likeness of His resurrection,<br />\n\tRom. 6:6 knowing this, that our&nbsp; old&nbsp; self was&nbsp; crucified with Him, in order that our&nbsp; body of sin might be&nbsp; done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin;<br />\n\tRom. 6:7 for&nbsp; he who has died is&nbsp; freed from sin.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tCol. 2:12 having been&nbsp; buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also&nbsp; raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who&nbsp; raised Him from the dead.<br />\n\tCol. 2:13 When you were&nbsp; dead&nbsp; in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He&nbsp; made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe New Testament teaches that the manner of Christian baptism follows naturally from it&#39;s intended purpose. Since water baptism is intended to depict our belief in Christ&#39;s death and resurrection, the manner of baptism was designed to fit that purpose. Therefore, we are \"buried\" (i.e., immersed into a body of water) and we are \"raised\" (i.e., lifted out of water) to mimic Christ&#39;s death and resurrection.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe early church practiced immersion as the only form of baptism. This is why in the Bible whenever we see the manner of baptism described, we always see new converts in a body of water (e.g., Matthew 3:6; Matthew 3:16; Acts 8:36). Never once is infant baptism or baptism by springing of water ever depicted, described or endorsed by scripture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tImmersion was the only method of baptism in the church until the Catholic church corrupted the practice by inventing \"baptism\" for infants. By distorting the Bible&#39;s teaching on original sin, the Catholic church began claiming it possessed the power to save children from Hell through infant baptism (which is a corrupt and unbiblical claim). The Catholic church first began to practice infant baptism in 416 AD, and later in 1311 AD, the Catholic church substituted pouring water on the child&#39;s forehead for full immersion. (These dates can be found in the Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume V.)</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the Catholic church is ultimately responsible for instituting this meaningless and unbiblical substitute for true believer baptism, sadly, some Reformation churches (i.e., Lutherans, Presbyterians, etc.) chose to continue this practice even after breaking free from Rome. Today, many Christian families perform this ritual on their children completely unaware they are repeating the sins of Rome while accomplishing nothing spiritually.&nbsp;Only a believer can make the decision to be baptized - baptism can&#39;t be done to us - so an infant baptism is no baptism at all. It is merely a public bath.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<strong><em>Q. I have been very moved by Pastor Armstrong&#39;s teaching, but I rarely experience the same impact when listening to my pastor preaching on Sundays. Why is there such a difference between his teaching and my pastor&#39;s preaching?&nbsp;</em></strong><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. There is no clear biblical distinction between preaching and teaching, but we can offer some observations based on our experience. First, teaching can be defined as expositing (or explaining) the meaning of scripture, while preaching combines Bible teaching with a specific call to obey the word of God. Proper preaching is dependent on sound teaching, for how can we obey what do not understand? Therefore, all sound preaching must include Bible teaching, though not all teaching must turn to preaching.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe choice of whether to \"teach\" or \"preach\" will depend on the speaker&#39;s purpose and the setting. For example, Pastor Armstrong usually performs teaching when addressing a Bible study class, since the classroom environment lends itself to didactic instruction and dialog, while an exhortation to react in a specific way isn&#39;t necessary or appropriate to the moment.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless even in such a teaching situation, the Holy Spirit remains constantly active in the hearts of believers to take the word of God as it is taught and use it to convict the hearer of sin and compel obedience to God&#39;s word.</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 4:12 For&nbsp; the word of God is living and&nbsp; active and sharper than any two-edged&nbsp; sword, and piercing as far as the division of&nbsp; soul and&nbsp; spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</h5>\n<h5>\n\t2Tim. 3:16&nbsp; All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for&nbsp; training in righteousness;&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn a different setting, Pastor Armstrong will consciously seek to exhort his listeners to think carefully about the teaching of scripture and consider a particular response. In this case, he preaches the message to encourage a specific response, which he feels properly reflects the teaching of the text. These moments are traditionally reserved for gatherings of the body intended for worship and exhortation&nbsp; (i.e., Sunday services, devotionals, conference sessions, etc.).</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce again, the proper preaching of the word depends first on proper teaching. If a speaker fails to teach a passage correctly (or to even address scripture at all), then their preaching will carry no authority nor propensity to move hearts. We suspect this is may be the issue you have encountered in your years listening to ineffective \"preaching\" in your church. If your pastor&#39;s preaching is not rooted in proper examination and teaching of God&#39;s word, then it is merely speech giving.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Is the act of prayer spiritual?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. As the Bible teaches us, prayer offers Christians the opportunity to speak directly to God in the name of Jesus Christ with the help of the Holy Spirit as they enter into communion with the Lord. This is a spiritual act of worship glorifying God and a privilege offered to Christians. On the other hand, merely assuming a posture of prayer and \"going through the motions\" is not - by itself - a spiritual act.</p>\n<p>\n\tPrayer is a spiritual process and goes beyond just words, and the Holy Spirit plays an essential role in our prayer life. It is an act of worship from the heart according to the will of God, and it depends upon the Holy Spirit directlng our thoughts and guiding our words, whether spoken or thought. As Paul taught:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 8:26 &nbsp;In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words;<br />\n\tRom. 8:27 &nbsp;and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He&nbsp; intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, our prayer is spiritually meaningful and effective because we have a relationship with Christ, Who serves as our High Priest to intercede on our behalf, which is why we pray in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 4:14 &nbsp;Therefore, since we have a great&nbsp; high priest who has&nbsp; passed through the heavens, Jesus&nbsp; the Son of God, let us hold fast our&nbsp; confession.<br />\n\tHeb. 4:15 For we do not have&nbsp; a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been&nbsp; tempted in all things as we are, yet&nbsp; without sin.<br />\n\tHeb. 4:16 Therefore let us&nbsp; draw near with&nbsp; confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tSo prayer is the unique privilege of God&#39;s people, and it is a spiritual act for us. For those who lack a personal relationship with the Father through His Son, prayer is not spiritual; it is merely posing. The Bible says that the Father only hears the prayers of His children, and He does not incline His ear to the prayers of an unrighteous (i.e., &nbsp;unbelieving) man.</p>"

Does this mean all Christians should observe the feasts?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nIn Acts 27:9, we read:</p>\n\n<h6>Acts 27:9 &nbsp;When considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, since even the fast was already over, Paul began to admonish them<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>In this verse Luke was referring to the fast that accompanies Yom Kippur or the Day of Atonement, which occurs in early Autumn. His reason for mentioning the fast was to draw attention to the time of year, since sailing on the Mediterranean Sea in the Fall can be especially dangerous due to unpredictable weather.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Luke&rsquo;s mention of the fast in this way does not necessarily mean Paul was observing the fast himself, since Luke uses the term merely as a point of reference on the Jewish calendar. Nevertheless, for argument&#39;s sake&nbsp;let&#39;s&nbsp;assume Paul did, indeed, observe the Jewish feasts from time to time, including observing the fast associated with Yom Kippur. Does Paul&rsquo;s choice to observe the feasts become a rule for all Christians?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The answer is no. As we seek to interpret the Bible, we must make a distinction between what is &ldquo;descriptive&rdquo; verses what is &ldquo;prescriptive.\" &nbsp;Many details in scripture are merely a description of events or people, but these descriptions are not intended by God to be a prescription for our choices and decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>For example, the Bible describes Abraham lying about his wife Sarah, and later taking his son to the top of a mountain to sacrifice him in obedience to God. These details are descriptive of Abraham&rsquo;s life, but they are not prescriptive for the church today. Obviously, all Christians are not expected to follow Abraham&rsquo;s example and lie about our wives &ndash; much less to sacrifice our children to God! Clearly, these scenes in the Bible are descriptions &ndash; not prescriptions!</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, Paul may have chosen to observe the Jewish feasts at times or even to visit the temple to present alms (Acts 24:17-18), but these accounts of Paul&rsquo;s life are given to us as descriptions, not prescriptions. Paul was acting in the liberty available to all Christians. As Christians, we have the liberty to celebrate the Jewish feasts if we desire and even to observe other aspects of Jewish culture and practice - so long as we don&rsquo;t hold that our choices must become requirements for all Christians.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Paul chose to observe certain aspects of Jewish life for a variety of good reasons, including to silence his Jewish critics and out of an appreciation for how these feasts pointed to Christ. Paul&#39;s choices were described in scripture, but these descriptions of Paul&rsquo;s choices do not trump the clear prescription given to Christians elsewhere in the Bible concerning Jewish law:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 7:6&nbsp;But now we have been&nbsp;released from the&nbsp;Law, having&nbsp;died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in&nbsp;newness of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Spirit and not in oldness of the letter.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Gal. 5:18&nbsp;But if you are&nbsp;led by the Spirit,&nbsp;you are not under the&nbsp;Law.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<p><br />\nAs Christians, we are not bound to observe Jewish law, though we may voluntarily choose to observe certain aspects (like the feasts) if we wish. This is the Bible&rsquo;s prescription to believers concerning these matters.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">So the Bible&rsquo;s description of Paul&rsquo;s choices does not become a prescription for all believers. We go elsewhere in the Bible to find the prescription.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For more teaching concerning a Christian&#39;s relationship to the Law of Moses, please read <a href=\"/devotionals/on_law_and_liberty_part_1\">On Law and Liberty</a>.

When you state that the present age corresponds to the church of Laodicea, are you keeping in mind that although this is the case in this country and the western world, there are many places, closed to westerners, where the Gospel and Christ&#39;s church is thriving much as it did in the New Testament period? Perhaps, as time passes, apostasy will creep in those areas as well. But it hasn&#39;t yet.</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tA. First, Pastor Armstrong&#39;s interpretation of the letters to the churches in the book of Revelation holds that each letter defines the nature of a period of church history. The seven letters reflect seven sequential periods of church history, and according to this view, the church of our day is the fulfillment of the seventh and final period of history prior to the return of Christ for the Church.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe seventh period of chruch history is a time of apostasy, according to the seventh letter and according to Paul. Paul says in the last days, those who gather as the church consist largely of unbelievers or very weak believers who lack solid understanding of the faith and Gospel. The church will follow after false teachers and will not sit for sound doctrine, according to Paul.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Pastor Armstrong taught, the seven periods of church history each reflect their respective church letter in an accurate yet general sense. In all periods of history, the church has always included exceptions to the rule. For example, the first century church was described as having a strong love for Christ and intolerance for false teachers, according to the letter to Ephesus, which represents the nature of the first century period. Nevertheless the first century also included churches that embraced false teachers, like the church in Galatia.</p>\n<p>\n\tThough the first century church was generally patterned on the letter to Ephesus, we could still find the occasional church that did not fit the pattern. Likewise, the church today is moving strongly in the direction of the Laodicean church, yet we can still find exceptions. Today we can find strong churches in various places, but they are the exceptions that prove the rule. The vast majority of churches are not strong Bible-teaching churches. On the contrary, more and more churches are following after false teaching and fads, mirroring the description of Laodicea.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso, we would challenge your assertion that the pattern of Laodicea is not limited to the Western church only. While the gospel is spreading faster in developing countries, particularly in the Far East, Asia and the Middle East, these area are not immune to the Laodicea trend.&nbsp; Sadly, churches in every region are falling for prosperity gospel teaching, word faith movement and other faddish unbiblical trends, which often get their start in Western churches.</p>\n<p>\n\tPastor Armstrong and VBVM Board members frequently travel and minister in developing regions of the world, and they report that churches on every continent are rapidly succumbing to false teaching, replacing strong orthodox biblical understanding and practice. Our age is, indeed, the Laodicean period, reminding us the Lord&#39;s return is closer than ever.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. I hear people talk about how God speaks to them, and they make it sound like He is speaking audibly to them. What is this small still voice that people are talking about that I am suppose to hear? I know that God talks to us through His word, and the Holy Spirit will guide us, but are there any other ways that He will communicate with us? I have meditated on His word, and listened intently after praying, but nothing happens. Am I doing something wrong?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. First, God is capable speak to man in dramatic, supernatural ways. He spoke to Abraham by voice and by angels, He spoke to Joseph in dreams, and He spoke to the Israelites from thunder. In Numbers 22:28, God spoke to Balaam through a donkey, and in the desert God spoke through fire on the mountain and to Moses through a burning bush.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches us that the Lord can communicate through a variety of means, including through an audible voice at times, but more often the Lord speaks through nonverbal means. The Bible teaches us that since Jesus has appeared, God no longer speaks to us apart from communicating through Jesus Christ:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 1:1&nbsp; God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,<br />\nHeb. 1:2&nbsp;&nbsp; in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So how does the Father speak to us through His Son? First and foremost, God speaks to us through the Bible, which is the Word, the written revelation of Himself in Christ:</p>\n\n<h5>John 1:1&nbsp;&nbsp; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The Lord uses His word to communicate timeless spiritual truths to us, and as we submit ourselves to all that scripture teaches, we will inevitably grow closer in our walk with the Lord. Though the Bible may not speak in specific terms about every issue we face in our daily lives, the word of God transcends daily life and speaks to principles of godliness, holiness, obedience, and love that regulate our thinking and actions under all circumstances. As Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and&nbsp; gave Himself up for her,<br />\nEph. 5:26&nbsp; so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the&nbsp; washing of water with the word,<br />\nEph. 5:27 that He might&nbsp; present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be&nbsp; holy and blameless.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>If we you are endeavoring to hear from God but you are not regularly and consistently studying in His word, then you may be missing what the Lord has already provided to you in His word. God will rarely give us a \"personal word\" much less a burning bush when the answers we seek have already been provided through Christ&#39;s word. This is why Paul reminds us to seek the scripture for all our needs:</p>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 3:16&nbsp; All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;<br />\n2Tim. 3:17 so that&nbsp; the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Secondly, God can speak to us through the example of Jesus living as a man. Men heard God in the form of Jesus and saw His heart and understood more of who He was. By observing the examples Jesus provided, we gain a better appreciation for the Lord&#39;s desire for how we live our lives. As John tells us:</p>\n\n<h5>John 1:18&nbsp; No one has seen God at any time;&nbsp; the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Thirdly, God speaks to us through nature and His Creation. We can &ldquo;hear&rdquo; God&rsquo;s voice through the details of His creation and better understand His infinite power and divine plan. The more we understand about God&#39;s greatness and power the more we will see our own unworthiness and weaknesses, which will help contend with pride. As Paul wrote:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 1:20 For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen,&nbsp; being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Fourth, God speaks to us through other people. We can &ldquo;hear&rdquo; God&rsquo;s voice through the counsel and teaching and prayers of other believers. Throughout the New Testament, the Lord uses His disciples to share His message of truth. By this community of workers, we can gain a clearer understanding of Christ&#39;s will for our lives. As Paul commanded:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 4:11 And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as&nbsp; evangelists, and some as pastors and&nbsp; teachers,<br />\nEph. 4:12&nbsp; for the equipping of the&nbsp; saints for the work of service, to the building up of&nbsp; the body of Christ;<br />\nEph. 4:13 until we all attain to&nbsp; the unity of the faith, and of the&nbsp;&nbsp; knowledge of the Son of God, to a&nbsp; mature man, to the measure of the stature&nbsp; which belongs to the&nbsp; fullness of Christ.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In a personal way, we can sense the Lord&#39;s leading in our prayer life. The Bible talks about the importance of prayer and fasting to clear our minds and prepare our hearts for God&rsquo;s voice. Often, the Lord&#39;s direction can come in the form of prayer requests we never expected to make but they came to mind as we prayed:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:26&nbsp; In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for&nbsp; we do not know how to pray as we should, but&nbsp; the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words;<br />\nRom. 8:27 and&nbsp; He who searches the hearts knows what&nbsp; the mind of the Spirit is, because He&nbsp; intercedes for the&nbsp; saints according to the will of God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>These moments of personal revelation are made possible by the Spirit. God&rsquo;s Spirit was with God in the very beginning waiting to breath life into His creation, and now the Spirit serves as an advocate for believers and gives them direction.</p>\n\n<h5>John 14:16 &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever;<br />\nJohn 14:17 that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you.</h5>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:16&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you not know that you are a&nbsp; temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Finally, the Lord can speak to us through our circumstances. The Lord is sovereign over all that transpires in our life. Every event comes under His hand and His control, so we must recognize that everything that happens is according to His will. As you witness the events of life pass by, do you stop to consider what God is telling you?</p>\n\n<p>Consider the example of the Prodigal Son in Luke 16. After leaving his home and taking his inheritance in a shameful act of selfishness, he enters a downward spiral of sin and debauchery. As he bottoms out eating the food of pigs, the man comes to his senses, repents and returns to the father. The circumstances of his life trigger an awareness that he should change his ways.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we can learn many things about God&#39;s will by observing our circumstances carefully and making wise, biblically-informed conclusions about what we see. For example, are you suffering from the consequences of sin? Perhaps the Lord is speaking to you about the need to repent. Has the Lord brought you through a sickness or financial trial? What did you learn as you persevered through the trial? Did you receive a financial windfall? How does the Lord want you to use it for His glory?</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes God speaks so loudly and clearly through circumstances, prayer, other believers or His word that we are tempted to think we heard God&#39;s voice, but even if we think we&#39;ve never heard from God, you can be sure that the Lord is not silent. Our Lord is a Lord who delights in revealing Himself to His people, reflected by the name He gave Himself in the Gospels: the Word.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Usually, our inability to hear God isn&#39;t a issue of God&#39;s silence. Instead, it&#39;s a problem of overlooking the many ways and times God does speak to us, because we&#39;re searching for something more dramatic and supernatural. Practice the routines of healthy Christian discipleship, and you will hear the Lord more and more, as He guides you into all righteousness. This is the full sense of living by faith and not by sight.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. The only time Jesus is shown kneeling in prayer is in the garden of&nbsp;Gethsemane. What is the significance of this posture?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Jesus&#39; posture in prayer is an indication of his submission to the Father&#39;s will. Kneeling is a sign of submission to authority. Men knee to acknowledge another&#39;s authority over us. For example:</p>\n<p>\n\tEven King Solomon acknowledged that he was a subject of a higher authority by kneeling:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Kings 8:54&nbsp;&nbsp; When Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and supplication to the LORD,&nbsp; he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his&nbsp; hands spread toward heaven.<br />\n\t1Kings 8:55 And he stood and&nbsp; blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying:<br />\n\t1Kings 8:56&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel,&nbsp; according to all that He&nbsp; promised;&nbsp; not one word has&nbsp; failed of all His good&nbsp; promise, which He&nbsp; promised through Moses His servant.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tAll men are called to acknowledge the Lord&#39;s rule in our lives by kneeling before Him in worship:</p>\n<h5>\n\tPsa. 95:6&nbsp; Come, let us worship and bow down,<br />\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let us&nbsp; kneel before the LORD our Maker.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tAnd so Jesus was kneeling in submission to the Father&#39;s authority. Jesus is described in Luke as kneeling when He sought the Father&#39;s permission to avoid the cross. Consider Jesus&#39; words as He prayed:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLuke 22:39&nbsp; And He came out and proceeded&nbsp; as was His custom to&nbsp; the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.<br />\n\tLuke 22:40&nbsp; When He arrived at the place, He said to them, &ldquo; Pray that you may not enter into temptation.&rdquo;<br />\n\tLuke 22:41 And He withdrew from them about a stone&rsquo;s throw, and He&nbsp; knelt down and began to pray,<br />\n\tLuke 22:42 saying, &ldquo;Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me;&nbsp; yet not My will, but Yours be done.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tNote that Jesus&#39; request to the Father was that Jesus be allowed to avoid the cross, and Jesus prayed in a posture of submission to the Father&#39;s authority. While it&#39;s likely that Jesus knelt at other times as well, this particular moment was crucial, since it demonstrated both the extent of Jesus&#39; suffering and His willingness to submit to the Father&#39;s authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus taught that we pray the Father&#39;s will be done, and in this moment we see evidence that Jesus prayed this way as well. Clearly, Jesus wished to avoid the pain of the cross, but He submitted to the will of the Father, and His kneeling demonstrated that submission.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Reading in 1Samuel 25, the story of Abigail shows her working behind her husband&#39;s back to appease David&#39;s wrath. The story appears to commend Abigail for her behavior, but I&#39;m concerned she failed to submit to her husband&#39;s authority. How do you see that story?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Before we address Abigail&#39;s situation, let&#39;s review the Bible&#39;s teaching on submission. As believers, both husbands and wives are called to submit to the Lord in all things. James says:</p>\n\n<h5>James 4:7&nbsp; Submit therefore to God.&nbsp; Resist the devil and he will flee from you.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Our first priority is to submit to the Lord in all things. His demands and instructions come first. Secondly, husbands and wives are called to submit to each other as it pleases the Lord.</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 5:21 &nbsp;and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Furthermore, we are to submit to various earthly authorities, including government and church leadership:</p>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 2:13&nbsp; Submit yourselves for the Lord&rsquo;s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority,<br />\n1Pet. 2:14 or to governors as sent&nbsp; by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice our submission should always be to the effect of doing what is right.&nbsp; Furthermore, wives submit to husbands:</p>\n\n<h5>Col. 3:18&nbsp;&nbsp; Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</h5>\n\n<h5>Eph. 5:22&nbsp; Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.<br />\nEph. 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself&nbsp; being the Savior of the body.<br />\nEph. 5:24 But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.</h5>\n\n<h5><br />\n1Pet. 3:1&nbsp; In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be&nbsp; won without a word by the behavior of their wives,<br />\nPet. 3:2 as they observe your chaste and&nbsp; respectful behavior.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Again, these commands to be submitted must be understood in light of scripture overall that calls for our behavior to be consistent with our submission to the Lord and to what is right.</p>\n\n<p>In the Bible, submission involves honoring the authority God has given another person over us, whether a husband, elder, government leaders. Obviously, there can be circumstances when an authority over us asks too much of us, as when Daniel was asked to worship a false god, and in these moments we choose to honor God by refusing the unrighteous request, just as Daniel refused to worship the king. In those moments, we place ourselves in God&#39;s hands, as Daniel did.</p>\n\n<p>So what is the right thing for a godly woman to do when her husband is engaged in ungodly behavior? This was the situation Abigail (and Sarah) experienced. In fact, 1Peter 3 uses Sarah, the wife of Abraham, as just such an example of how a woman may display godliness and submission to a husband even when he is imperfect and prone to sinful mistakes.</p>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 3:5 For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands;<br />\n1Pet. 3:6 just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear. When Peter is talking about fear, he is talking about the fear of doing what is right.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Although Abraham&rsquo;s request was sinful, Sarah put her hope and faith in the Lord and submitted to her husband anyway. Much like Abigail, she gave up of herself for the benefit of her husband, and she did so out of submission to Abraham and to protect him. Because she put her faith in the Lord in submitting to Abraham&rsquo;s request, not giving into fear, and so God protected her.</p>\n\n<p>In the same way, Abigail put her hope in the Lord and did what was necessary to protect her husband&rsquo;s life. She did not give in to her fear of doing what was right, and so God protected her from David&#39;s men and from Nabal&rsquo;s anger. Since we must all give an account to the Lord for our actions, we must be sure in our conscience that our actions are consistent with God&#39;s will and His word, and these women acted in confidence that they were serving the Lord and their husbands in the best way.</p>\n\n<p>Both Sarah and Abigail are examples of women who chose a path that honored their husbands as best possible while also honoring God&#39;s word (and in Abigail&#39;s case, also honoring an anointed king!).&nbsp; In both cases, God stepped in to rescue a righteous woman from her husband&#39;s misdeeds. The Bible never requires that a woman live in a state of \"slavery\" to her husband or tolerate physical abuse, nor does it demand that a woman violate the word of God to support her husband. It does call for men and women to honor the authorities over us by every way possible.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, should a woman be asked by her husband to do the wrong thing, she must seek the best possible way to submit to his authority without participating in his sin. If a husband demands his wife commit sin, she is right to refuse such a request to avoid the sin, but she should still look for other ways to submit and protect her husband, as Sarah did.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If a woman is subject to physical abuse, she has a right to seek protection and relief. Similarly, if a husband is abusing children, a wife is within her rights to protect the innocent. In all cases, the wife should act to support her husband and lead him into repentance and godliness if she can. In the end, the woman&#39;s decisions must be guided first by love for God, followed by love for her husband.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, having an imperfect husband is never reason for a wife to withhold her submission altogether (as Sarah demonstrated). A wife may refuse to comply with her husband&#39;s requests only when they come into direct conflict with the Lord&#39;s word. Submission to any earthly authority should always fall in line with submission to the Lord.</p>\n\n<p>So as we observe Abigail&rsquo;s actions in 1 Samuel 25, we see that her motivation was to show respect and submission to her husband while also fulfilling the role God created for her as her husband&rsquo;s &ldquo;helper,\" which God assigned to woman in Genesis 2.</p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew word for &ldquo;helper&rdquo; in Genesis 2:18, 20 is <em>ezer neged,</em> which translates &ldquo;helper against/help who protects.&rdquo; In the Old Testament, <em>ezer</em> describes aspects of God&rsquo;s character &ndash; He is our strength, our rescuer, our protector and our help. The spiritual role of a wife it to be her husband&#39;s helper, which includes working against those things which might bring him harm. This is what Abigail did in the story of 1Samuel 25.</p>\n\n<p>Also, it is important to understand how significant honor was in ancient Eastern culture. David&#39;s men had performed a service for Nabal, yet Nabal failed to recognize and compensate David for his work. &nbsp;Such a failure could bring dire consequences in that culture.</p>\n\n<p>In 1Samuel 25, David&#39;s men had provided protection and hospitality to Nabal&#39;s shepherds, which was a blessing to Nabal (1 Sam. 25:14-16), but Nabal did not return the gesture. Instead, he acted in foolishness and pride, which could have resulted in his death and the death of his household by David&#39;s hand (1 Sam. 25:17, 34).</p>\n\n<p>After learning about her husband&#39;s mistake, Abigail took action to protect the family and her husband, which was in keeping with her responsibility as a helper to her husband. Abigail fulfilled her God-given role as his wife by attempting to compensate for her husband&rsquo;s foolishness. She also fulfilled her cultural role of providing hospitality to David and his men. (1 Sam. 25:25). Furthermore, she acted without directly violating any of her husband&#39;s commands.</p>\n\n<p>In Proverbs 31:12 we learn that a wife of noble character brings her husband good, not harm all the days of her life. Abigail was such a woman. She was an intelligent woman (1 Sam. 25:3), who was submitting to the Lord while trying to honor and protect her husband without sharing in his sin. Abigail was also honest with her husband (1 Sam. 25:37-38), and God protected her. In the end, she also honored and submitted to Israel&#39;s anointed king, thus saving David from the sin of avenging himself through murdering Nabal&rsquo;s household (1 Sam. 25:33-34). The Bible commends Abigail for her actions.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, we know the Lord takes her husband&#39;s life, but Abigail did not cause Nabal&rsquo;s death. She knew Nabal was wrong, but she left room for God to be his Judge. God decided to avenge his servant David by killing Nabal (1 Sam. 25:22), and He did so because of Nabal own sin, not because of Abigail, for she acted in a godly manner and submitter herself to the Lord.</p>\n\n<p>Abigail did her best to serve the Lord and to honor her husband. In this case, these roles conflicted to a degree. Her desire to be a godly woman by honoring David&#39;s men was at odds with her husband&#39;s sinful decision to spurn David&#39;s men. Like Sarah, Abigail had a difficult decision to make, but she put God&#39;s desires first. Still, eash woman accomolished this goal in different ways. While Sarah remained silent and allowed her husband&#39;s plan to go forward, Abigail took action to stop her husband&#39;s folly. In both cases, however, these women acted to obey God and to protect their husbands. They took opposite actions but obtained similar outcomes for similar reasons.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, submission to earthly authorities is an important command in scripture, but it is not the highest command in the Bible. Submission to God and personal holiness are the highest call of every believer, both man and woman. When our submission to earthly authorities puts our obedience to God at risk, we must choose God over man. Abigail efforts to honor and protect her husband - including taking actions contrary to her husband&#39;s desire - were praised in scripture because they were done in obecdience to God, out of love and respect for her husband and in honor of the Lord&#39;s His anointed servant, David. Throughout, she acted with restraint and honesty, making every effort to demonstrate submission with godliness.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, every believer must balance these principles like Abigail &ndash; by relying on the guidance of scripture and the Holy Spirit.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"grammarly-disable-indicator\">&nbsp;</div>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. I have been invited to attend the wedding of atheists who are making a civil union before a judge. Previously, they have been living together in sin. I do not approve of their lifestyle, and though they are my friends, I am concerned about doing the wrong thing by attending the reception. What should I do?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. First, there is nothing immoral or wrong with atheists marrying. Remember, marriage is an institution God created for all humanity. It is not a \"Christian\" institution, since marriage originated in the Garden and&nbsp;predates both the fall of Man and&nbsp;the appearance of Christ. S<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">o long as a couple meets the biblical requirements for marriage (i.e., one man and one woman </span><a href=\"/bible-answers/can-a-believer-divorce-or-remarry\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">who are not already married</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">), then the marriage is appropriate, and therefore&nbsp;a Christian may attend the event without fear of sinning.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, this couple&#39;s choice to marry is an <em><strong>improvement</strong></em> over their current circumstances. Currently, they are living in an immoral relationship (i.e., fornication), which a Christian can&#39;t condone, but once the couple marries,&nbsp;they will have corrected this error. At that point, you will have much to celebrate, since the sin you disapprove will have been eliminated! Therefore, attending the wedding isn&#39;t an endorsement of their&nbsp;sinful lifestylel; on the contrary, it&nbsp;celebrates&nbsp;the end of a sinful lifestyle.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly,&nbsp;all Christians are called to be \"in the world\" but not \"of the world:\"</p>\n\n<h5>John 17:14 &ldquo;I have given them Your word; and&nbsp; the world has hated them, because&nbsp; they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<br />\nJohn 17:15 &ldquo;I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one.<br />\nJohn 17:16 &ldquo; They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Being \"of this world\" means following the unbelieving world&#39;s values, beliefs, and conduct. Christians are not to share in these things. Instead, we are to follow Christ&#39;s word and reflect it by our words and actions.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Jesus specifically says the Church was to remain in the world for a time. While we are here, the Christian is an ambassador for Christ, Paul says.</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 5:20 &nbsp;Therefore, we are&nbsp; ambassadors for Christ,&nbsp; as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be&nbsp; reconciled to God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Just as our nation&#39;s ambassadors are commissioned to live on foreign soil for a time so they can represent our nation in that place, so are Christians called to live for a time in a world that is not our eternal home so we can represent Christ&#39;s kingdom to unbelievers.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Christ expects us to represent Him in a loving way. We are not sent to act as judges and critics (as the Pharisees were) nor are we seeking to shame unbelievers for their sins. Rather, we know it is the kindness of God that bring men to repentance, and so we come to represent the Father&#39;s love and kindness in the face of Christ. Like any good ambassador, we want to represent the mercy and grace of our King by reflecting the light of Christ, and in so doing, we hope to attract the unbeliever to Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus lived this example for us in the Gospels. Jesus never sinned, yet He made Himself available to sinners on a regular basis. He ate with sinners, the Gospels tell us. He counseled prostitutes. He stayed in the homes of tax collector and other evil men. He was willing to associated Himself with sinners in this way, because Jesus was sent to heal the sick, and as He said, healthy people don&#39;t need the services of a doctor.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Christians aren&#39;t called to restrict our associations to only sinless people - if this were the case, we could have no friends at all! Instead, we are called to live in and among the unbelieving world as witnesses to Christ. To do this, we <u>must</u> associate ourselves with immoral men. In fact, Paul commands us to do this very thing:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 5:9&nbsp; I wrote you in my letter&nbsp; not to associate with immoral people;<br />\n1Cor. 5:10 I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world, or with the covetous and swindlers, or with&nbsp; idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world.<br />\n1Cor. 5:11 But&nbsp; actually, I wrote to you not to associate&nbsp; with any so-called&nbsp; brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or&nbsp; an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler &mdash; not even to eat with such a one.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Ironically, Paul says the only immoral people we are NOT supposed to associate with are immoral <em>Christians</em>!&nbsp; On the other hand, we are supposed to live among immoral unbelievers, for there is no other way to exist in this fallen world. In fact, Paul says the only way to keep yourself entirely free from from immoral people would be to leave the world altogether. Clearly, this is not our calling.</p>\n\n<p>So in your situation, you should spend as much time as possible around your unbelieving friends, including celebrating their marriage with them. Attend the reception without expressing judgment or seeking to cause them shame. As you celebrate with them, be a witness to Christ. You are Christ&#39;s representative to the wedding, and how much better is it that Christ would be represented in that moment than not at all!</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, you will not be sinning by your attendance, since there is nothing about your attendance that constitutes sin. And you are not \"condoning\" their sinful choices simply by spending time with them, any more than we endorse the lifestyle of a sinful person by attending their birthday party or visiting them in the hospital. Again, if we tried to limit our associations to only sinless people, we couldn&#39;t even associate with ourselves!</p>\n\n<p>More over, imagine how your friends will react when they see loving, sincere Christians enjoying their celebration with them without passing judgment? Undoubtedly, in the past they have experienced the judgmental attitude of pious Christians, who have withheld fellowship and kindness to make a point. What a breath of fresh air it will be for your friends to experience your fellowship and lack of judgment! Perhaps it will lead them to wonder why you are different, and this will lead to a conversation about Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, we are on the earth to serve Christ as ambassadors so we can introduce people to His kingdom. Let&#39;s work in purity and love endeavoring to make as many introductions as we can.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. In teaching through Romans 3:25, you make a distinction between \"though faith\" and &#39;by faith,\" but I didn&#39;t understand the explanation. When Paul teaches we have salvation \"though faith,\" rather than by faith, is Paul saying that faith is a passage way?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA. First, the Bible teaches that no man, by is own will or intellect, will ever choose to accept the Gospel and be saved.</p>\n\n<h5>Psa. 53:1&nbsp; The fool has said in his heart, &ldquo;There is no God,&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no one who does good.<br />\nPsa. 53:2 &nbsp;God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To see if there is&nbsp; anyone who&nbsp; understands,<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Who&nbsp; seeks after God.<br />\nPsa. 53:3&nbsp; Every one of them has turned aside; together they have become corrupt;<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no one who does good, not even one.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNo (natural) man seeks for God or understands His ways of righteousness, according to scripture. Not one. Paul explains further:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:5 For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on&nbsp; the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit,&nbsp; the things of the Spirit.<br />\nRom. 8:6&nbsp; For the mind set on the flesh is&nbsp; death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace,<br />\nRom. 8:7 because the mind set on the flesh is&nbsp; hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so,<br />\nRom. 8:8 and those who are&nbsp; in the flesh cannot please God.<br />\nWe hope this information will be helpful to you, and may the Lord bless your devotion to His holy word.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNo (natural) man will ever set his mind upon the Spirit or the commandments of God. A man&#39;s mind is not even able to do so, Paul says. Therefore, no man can find God through his own intellect, for his natural fallen state precludes such a search or discovery. Simply put, men will not and cannot find God on their own.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, a natural man is set against God, and he instinctively views God as an enemy. No amount of persuasion can overcome the sinful nature and its opposition to God. Our rejection of God is so complete that the Bible compares it to a state of death, as if we are a corpse, spiritually speaking.</p>\n\n<p>Paul explains this further in Ephesians:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:1&nbsp; And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,<br />\nEph. 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the&nbsp; course of&nbsp; this world, according to&nbsp; the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in&nbsp; the sons of disobedience.<br />\nEph. 2:3 Among them we too all&nbsp; formerly lived in&nbsp; the lusts of our flesh,&nbsp; indulging the desires of the flesh and of the&nbsp; mind, and were&nbsp; by nature&nbsp; children of wrath,&nbsp; even as the rest.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nPaul says it wasn&#39;t our sin that made us enemies of God; rather, it was our nature that brought us under His wrath. Our sinful behaviors are just eternal symptoms of this underlying spiritual problem. As the saying goes, we are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are born sinners.</p>\n\n<p>In chapter 4, Paul contrasts the new state of every believer with his prior state as a natural man. Notice how Paul describes the state of an unbeliever:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 4:17&nbsp;&nbsp; So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the&nbsp; futility of their mind,<br />\nEph. 4:18 being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;<br />\nEph. 4:19 and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nOur former state prior to salvation was one in which we were \"dead\" to the gospel and we walked according to the \"futility\" of our minds. We were darkened in our understanding and excluded from the life of God because of an ignorance and hardness of heart that could not be penetrated apart from God&#39;s grace.</p>\n\n<p>Paul sums up this problem simply in one verse in 1Corinthians:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 2:14&nbsp; But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nWe could describe salvation as a \"Catch 22.\"&nbsp; Paul says the message of the Gospel saves men, but it can only be understood by being spiritually appraised. In other words, you have to be saved already to understand the Gospel, since the message of God can only be understood by a living, born-again spirit. Notice Paul says a natural man \"does not accept\" the things of the Spirit. It is literally impossible for an unbeliever to believe the Gospel of their own will.</p>\n\n<p>So how can anyone be saved????&nbsp; The answer is God MUST act first to overcome our natural, unbelieving state by giving us a living spirit capable of belief in the Gospel. God MUST become the author of our faith, for faith can come no other way, according to scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Paul explains this process at numerous points in the NT, but perhaps the best is found in Ephesian 2:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of&nbsp; His great love with which He loved us,<br />\nEph. 2:5 even when we were&nbsp; dead&nbsp; in our transgressions, made us alive together&nbsp; with Christ ( by grace you have been saved),<br />\nEph. 2:6 and&nbsp; raised us up with Him, and&nbsp; seated us with Him in&nbsp; the heavenly places in&nbsp; Christ Jesus,<br />\nEph. 2:7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing&nbsp; riches of His grace in&nbsp; kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.<br />\nEph. 2:8 For&nbsp; by grace you have been saved&nbsp; through faith; and&nbsp; that not of yourselves, it is&nbsp; the gift of God;<br />\nEph. 2:9&nbsp; not as a result of works, so that&nbsp; no one may boast.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice Paul says that while we were still in that state of deadness, the Lord initiated the salvation process. By the Spirit, He gave us new life (made us born again by Spirit), through the gift of faith by which we believed the gospel. As Paul says in Romans 2:4, it is the kindness of God that brings us to repentance.</p>\n\n<p>So in summary, God acted first to bring us new life by His Spirit, then as a result of that new spiritual birth, we gained the ability to have faith and believe the message of the Gospel.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning Evangelism</p>\n\n<p>We now turn to understanding what the Bible says concerning the role of the evangelist. First, we notice in the verses we read above that salvation comes BY grace and THROUGH faith, according to Ephesian 2:8.</p>\n\n<p>Paul&#39;s connecting words are important. Salvation is not BY faith. It is BY grace. God&#39;s grace is what saves us, not our faith. If it were our faith that produced salvation, then we could take credit for our own salvation. Paul teaches that faith is a gift given to us, so therefore salvation is BY God&#39;s grace and manifested to us THROUGH our faith. Simply put, our evidence that God&#39;s grace has come to us is our faith in the Gospel, which is the means God has chosen for His children to display His grace to the word. As Paul said in Romans 3:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 3:21&nbsp; But now apart&nbsp; from the Law&nbsp; the righteousness of God has been manifested, being&nbsp; witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,<br />\nRom. 3:22 even the&nbsp; righteousness of God through&nbsp; faith&nbsp; in Jesus Christ for&nbsp; all those&nbsp; who believe; for&nbsp; there is no distinction;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nFaith is the way by which God&#39;s grace is manifested in us.</p>\n\n<p>Paul says this in 1Corinthians:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 1:18&nbsp; For the word of the cross is&nbsp; foolishness to&nbsp; those who&nbsp; are perishing, but to us who&nbsp; are being saved it is&nbsp; the power of God.<br />\n1Cor. 1:19 For it is written,<br />\n&ldquo; I WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE,<br />\nAND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER I WILL SET ASIDE.&rdquo;<br />\n1Cor. 1:20&nbsp; Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of&nbsp; this age? Has not God&nbsp; made foolish the wisdom of&nbsp; the world?<br />\n1Cor. 1:21 For since in the wisdom of God&nbsp; the world through its wisdom did not come to know God,&nbsp; God was well-pleased through the&nbsp; foolishness of the&nbsp; message preached to&nbsp; save those who believe.<br />\n1Cor. 1:22 For indeed&nbsp; Jews ask for&nbsp; signs and Greeks search for wisdom;<br />\n1Cor. 1:23 but we preach&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ crucified,&nbsp; to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles&nbsp; foolishness,<br />\n1Cor. 1:24 but to those who are&nbsp; the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ&nbsp; the power of God and&nbsp; the wisdom of God.<br />\n1Cor. 1:25 Because the&nbsp; foolishness of God is wiser than men, and&nbsp; the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br />\n1Cor. 1:26 &para; For&nbsp; consider your&nbsp; calling, brethren, that there were&nbsp; not many wise according to&nbsp; the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;<br />\n1Cor. 1:27 but&nbsp; God has chosen the foolish things of&nbsp; the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of&nbsp; the world to shame the things which are strong,<br />\n1Cor. 1:28 and the base things of&nbsp; the world and the despised God has chosen,&nbsp; the things that are not, so that He may&nbsp; nullify the things that are,<br />\n1Cor. 1:29 so that&nbsp; no&nbsp; man may boast before God.<br />\n1Cor. 1:30 But&nbsp; by His doing you are in&nbsp; Christ Jesus, who became to us&nbsp; wisdom from God,&nbsp; and&nbsp; righteousness and&nbsp; sanctification, and&nbsp; redemption,<br />\n1Cor. 1:31 so that, just as it is written, &ldquo; LET HIM WHO BOASTS, BOAST IN THE LORD.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nNotice in vs.23-24 Paul says he came to Corinth preaching a foolish message that was guaranteed to be rejected by Jew and Gentile alike, since natural men perceive the Gospel as foolishness. This is exactly as God intended. God intentionally chose a foolish-sounding message (i.e., the message of the cross) as the required content of saving faith, and He did so to shame the so-called wisdom of the world. Then God elected the weak and the ignominious of the world to believe this message, so that in eternity they would serve as witnesses against the so-called wise, strong and noble of the world.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, notice in v.30 Paul says we are \"in Christ Jesus\" by His (Christ&#39;s) doing. None of us became believers because of our own acceptance or agreement with a foolish message. We became believers because the Lord made us so.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, sending men like Paul to preach and persuade men of the truth of the Gospel is a part of God&#39;s plan to grow the church, just as Paul went to Corinth to preach a foolish message, but did God REQUIRE Paul&#39;s participation in order to bring faith to Corinth? Self-evidently not, since even Paul himself came to faith without another man preaching the Gospel to him (see Acts 9). Therefore, we conclude that though the Lord doe not NEED men to contribute to the work of salvation, nevertheless the Lord desires to work through me to accomplish His purposes. So we are commanded to go.</p>\n\n<p>Not surprisingly, it was Paul who taught that the persuasive efforts of an evangelist rest upon God for a positive outcome:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 5:11&nbsp; Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are&nbsp; made manifest also in your consciences.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nPaul says he worked diligently to persuade men because of his fear of the Lord, but still he hoped that his presentation would be \"made manifest\" to his listeners&#39; consciences. This is the relationship between evangelists and the Lord. We are the workers in the field, we plant, we water, but the Lord causes the growth, as Paul wrote:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 3:5&nbsp; What then is Apollos? And what is Paul?&nbsp; Servants through whom you believed, even&nbsp; as the Lord gave opportunity to each one.<br />\n1Cor. 3:6&nbsp; I planted,&nbsp; Apollos watered, but&nbsp; God was causing the growth.<br />\n1Cor. 3:7 So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth.<br />\n1Cor. 3:8 Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will&nbsp; receive his own&nbsp; reward according to his own labor.<br />\n1Cor. 3:9 For we are God&rsquo;s&nbsp; fellow workers; you are God&rsquo;s field, God&rsquo;s building.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nSo men must act to preach the word and spread the gospel as a matter of personal obedience, but God gives this command not because it is necessary to create faith. On the contrary, only God can bring saving faith. Instead, we are commanded to obey so we may enjoy the fruits of obedience, which is eternal reward. Salvation comes by God&#39;s Spirit with our without our obedience.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning Personal Confession</p>\n\n<p>Paul also wrote:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 10:9&nbsp; that&nbsp; if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and&nbsp; believe in your heart that&nbsp; God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;<br />\nRom. 10:10 for with the heart a person believes,&nbsp; resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses,&nbsp; resulting in salvation.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nSimilarly, Jesus commanded men to repent and believe:</p>\n\n<h5>Mark 1:14&nbsp; Now after John had been&nbsp; taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,<br />\nMark 1:15 and saying, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand;&nbsp; repent and believe in the gospel.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\nClearly, the scriptures anticipate a specific, personal response from each believer when confronted with the Gospel. Men are to repent, believe, and confess their belief. Furthermore, believers are to enter into the water to receive baptism. All of these steps are expected. Paul says in Romans 10 that a man is made righteous by belief in the heart, but then he goes further to declare that when he confesses this belief with his mouth, the result is salvation.</p>\n\n<p>Since we know that salvation is not dependent on a man&#39;s work, how do we reconcile these statements? Paul is speaking about the personal impact of salvation on the individual. As God brings faith to a heart, righteousness is imputed and the person is born again. At this moment, the person has become a believer, but without the step of making a personal confession, their salvation will not be apparent to the individual. They have not demonstrated their faith outwardly.</p>\n\n<p>In the same way that believers are commanded to be water baptized, likewise the confession of faith is the first act of a believer following belief in the heart. Self-evidently, a confession of faith can only come from a believer, and that believer is already saved by faith in the heart even before they open their lips to confess. Like baptism, confession is an act of obedience by a believer who is called to respond to God&#39;s grace.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, why are Christians sent to the world with an appeal for the world to \"trust in Jesus?\" Because this is the manner by which the Lord has chosen to invite his elect into the family of God. When the message is delivered to one who has been called by the Spirit, the hearer will respond and believe. This call and response pattern is God&#39;s chosen method. Regardless of the method the Lord chooses, the source of faith and salvation is always the Spirit.</p>"

We have no evidence from scripture that John the Baptist was ever baptized. Christ commanded water baptism as an ordinance for the Church as the means of believers testifying to their personal repentance and acceptance of the Gospel. Prior to Christ&#39;s command, however, water baptism was not a requirement of Jewish life. Men were not routinely water baptized. Instead, Jews received ritual washings only under certain circumstances as prescribed in the Law of Moses.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn the Baptist lived and died prior to Christ&#39;s sacrifice on the cross, so he was not part of the Church. He was considered the final Old Testament prophet prior to the appearance of Christ.&nbsp;He delivered a call to repentance and invited Jews wishing to demonstrate a repentant heart to receive water baptism in keeping with the tradition of Jewish washings.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, John the Baptist likely was never baptized himself, at least not in the sense of how it is now practiced in the New Testament church, nor was baptism a required for him since he was not a participant in the Church.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q.&nbsp;Is the Apocrypha inspired scripture?</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tA. The term apocrypha has several meanings. From its Greek root, it means hidden, or&nbsp;concealed. However, it also referred to a book whose origin was unknown. Over time,&nbsp;this term came to be used to describe any book that was non-canonical. Today, due to the apocryphal books included in the Catholic Bible, most Protestants understand this term to refer to those books in the Catholic Bible that are not in the Protestant Bible.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the Catholic church believes it is infallible, and since they state that the Council of Trent issued infallible decrees, and since at the Council of Trent the Catholic church &ldquo;infallibly&rdquo; declared the apocryphal books to be canonical (i.e., God breathed Scripture), it is worth looking at these books and the reasons why the Jews and Protestants do not include them in their OT canon.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt Trent (Session IV), the Catholic church explicitly named the books of both the OT and NT: &ldquo;It [the Council] has thought it proper, moreover, to insert in this decree a list of the sacred books, lest a doubt might arise in the mind of someone as to which are the books received by this council.&rdquo; Going even further, the Council of Trent pronounced that those who do not accept the apocryphal books as Scripture are accursed:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;If anyone does not accept as sacred and canonical the aforesaid books in their entirety and with all their parts, as they have been accustomed to be read in the Catholic Church and as they are contained in the old Latin Vulgate Edition, and knowingly and deliberately rejects the aforesaid traditions, let him be anathema.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIf one believes the Catholic church is infallible, then it would be very important to follow their decree so as not to be anathematized (i.e., accursed). As we examine the apocryphal books, however, we&rsquo;ll see that the Catholic church is not only not infallible, they are in gross error to include the apocryphal books.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore we examine these books, it&rsquo;s important to point out how we received the apocryphal books. The original OT canon was Jewish, and contained the twenty two books (the same thirty nine in today&rsquo;s Protestant Bible). This canon was known as the Palestinian canon. When the Hebrew OT was translated into Greek (the Septuagint) in Alexandria, Egypt, included in the canon were fifteen books known as the Apocrypha. These were likely included due to the tradition of many churches viewing these books as &ldquo;useful&rdquo;, but not canonical, as we will see. It should also be noted that not all of these books were accepted by the Council of Trent. Per Vlach:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;Of the fifteen books mentioned in the Alexandrian list, twelve were accepted and incorporated into the Roman Catholic Bible. Only 1 and 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh were not included. Though twelve of these works are included in the Catholic Douay Bible, only seven additional books are listed in the table of contents. The reason is that Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah were combined into one book; the additions of Esther were added to the book of Esther; the Prayer of Azariah was inserted between the Hebrew Daniel 3:23 and 24; Susanna was placed at the end of the book of Daniel (ch. 13); and Bel and the Dragon was attached to Daniel as chapter 14.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tVlach also provides a very useful summary of each of these fifteen books, as shown below.</p>\n<p>\n\t1. The First Book of Esdras (150&mdash;100 B.C.) (not included in Catholic Bible) &ndash; This work begins with a description of the Passover celebration under King Josiah and relates Jewish history down to the reading of the Law in the time of Ezra. It reproduces with little change 2 Chronicles 35:1&mdash;36:21, the book of Ezra and Nehemiah 7:73&mdash;8:13a. It also includes the story of three young men, in the court of Darius, who held a contest to determine the strongest thing in the world. 1 Esdras has legendary accounts which cannot be supported by Ezra, Nehemiah or 2 Chronicles.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t2. The Second Book of Esdras (c. A.D. 100) (not included in Catholic Bible) Differs from the other fifteen books in that it is an apocalypse. It has seven revelations (3:1&mdash;14:48) in which the prophet is instructed by the angel Uriel concerning the great mysteries of the moral world. It reflects the Jewish despair following the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t3. Tobit (c. 200&mdash;150 B.C.) The Book of Tobit describes the doings of Tobit, a man from the tribe of Naphtali, who was exiled to Ninevah where he zealously continued to observe the Mosaic Law. This book is known for its sound moral teaching and promotion of Jewish piety. It is also known for its mysticism and promotion of astrology and the teaching of Zoroastrianism (The Bible Almanac, eds. Packer, Tenney and White, p. 501).<br />\n\t<br />\n\t4. Judith (c. 150 B.C.) Judith is a fictitious story of a Jewish woman who delivers her people. It reflects the patriotic mood and religious devotion of the Jews after the Maccabean rebellion.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t5. The Additions to the Book of Esther (140-130 B.C.) 107 verses added to the book of Esther that were lacking in the original Hebrew form of the book.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t6. The Wisdom of Solomon (c. 30 B.C.) This work was composed in Greek by an Alexandrian Jew who impersonated King Solomon.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t7. Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach (c. 180 B.C.) This book is the longest and one of the most highly esteemed of the apocryphal books. The author was a Jewish sage named Joshua (Jesus, in Greek) who taught young men at an academy in Jerusalem. Around 180 B.C. he turned his classroom lectures into two books. This work contains numerous maxims formulated in about 1,600 couplets and grouped according to topic (marriage, wealth, the law, etc.).<br />\n\t<br />\n\t8. Baruch (c. 150-50 B.C.) This book claims to have been written in Babylon by a companion and recorder of Jeremiah (Jer. 32:12; 36:4). It is mostly a collection of sentences from Jeremiah, Daniel, Isaiah and Job. Most scholars are agreed that it is a composite work put together by two or more authors around the first century B.C.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t9. The Letter of Jeremiah (c. 300-100 B.C.) This letter claims to be written by the prophet Jeremiah at the time of the deportation to Babylon. In it he warns the people about idolatry.</p>\n<p>\n\t10. The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men (2nd&mdash; 1st century B.C.) This section is introduced to Daniel in the Catholic Bible after Daniel 3:23 and supposedly gives more details of the fiery furnace incident.</p>\n<p>\n\t11. Susanna (Daniel 13 in the Catholic Bible) (2nd &mdash; 1st century B.C.) In this account, Daniel comes to the rescue of the virtuous Susanna who was wrongly accused of adultery.</p>\n<p>\n\t12. Bel and the Dragon (Daniel 14 in the Catholic Bible) (c. 100 B.C.) Bel and the Dragon is made up of two stories. The first (vv. 1-22) tells of a great statue of Bel (the Babylonian god Marduk). Supposedly this statue of Bel would eat large quantities of food showing that he was a living god who deserved worship. Daniel, though, proved it was the priests of Bel who were eating the food. As a result, the king put the priests to death and allowed Daniel to destroy Bel and its temple. In the second story (vv. 23-42), Daniel, in defiance of the king, refuses to worship a great dragon. Daniel, instead, asks permission to slay the dragon without &ldquo;sword or club&rdquo; (v. 26). Given permission, Daniel feeds the dragon lumps of indigestible pitch, fat and hair so that the dragon bursts open (v. 27).</p>\n<p>\n\t13. The Prayer of Manasseh (2nd or 1st century B.C.) (Not in Catholic Bible) This work is a short penitential psalm written by someone who read in 2 Chronicles 33:11-19 that Manasseh, the wicked king of Judah, composed a prayer asking God&rsquo;s forgiveness for his many sins.</p>\n<p>\n\t14. The First Book of the Maccabees (c. 110 B.C.) &ldquo;The First Book of Maccabees is a generally reliable historical account of the fortunes of Jewish people between 175 and 134 B.C., relating particularly to their struggle with Antiochus IV Epiphanes and his successors. . . . The name of the author, a patriotic Jew at Jerusalem is unknown&rdquo; (Metzger, p. 169). The book derives its name from Maccabeus, the surname of a Jew who led the Jews in revolt against Syrian oppression.</p>\n<p>\n\t15. The Second Book of the Maccabees (c. 110-70 B.C.) This book is not a continuation of 1 Maccabees but an independent work partially covering the period of 175-161 B.C. This book is not as historically reliable as 1 Maccabees.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhy Christians Reject the Apocrypha<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>\n\tWhy do Christians reject the Apocryphal books as canonical?&nbsp;There are at least eight good reasons why Christians reject the apocryphal books as being included in the OT canon. These include history and evidence from some of the books themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, no apocryphal books were written by a prophet. All of the OT Scriptures were written by prophets, while none of the apocryphal books were; therefore, the apocryphal books are not canonical. Scripture attests to this view in that the OT is referred to as the Scriptures of the prophets. Specific references include (with emphases added):</p>\n<h5>\n\tSo we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts. (2 Peter 1:19)</h5>\n<h5>\n\t<br />\n\tBut now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith; (Romans 16:26)</h5>\n<h5>\n\t<br />\n\tAs He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old. (Luke 1:70)</h5>\n<h5>\n\t<br />\n\tBut Abraham said, &#39;They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.&rdquo; (Luke<br />\n\t16:29)</h5>\n<h5>\n\t<br />\n\tThen beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He explained to them the<br />\n\tthings concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.&rdquo; (Luke 24:27)</h5>\n<h5>\n\t<br />\n\tGod, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in<br />\n\tmany ways (Hebrews 1:1)</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tMore Scripture could be quoted, but clearly, the prophets are equivalent to the OT, as God spoke His word solely through prophets. Furthermore, it is generally agreed (especially among the Jews) that Malachi was the last prophet before John the Baptist. Yet most of the writers of the apocrypha lived after Malachi. In addition, the apocrypha was not written in Hebrew as was all of the OT (most were written in Greek). If inspired, it would only make sense that the writers would write in the language of Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond, the apocryphal books were not accepted by the Jews as part of the OT. If these books were part of the canonical OT, then surely Jesus would have criticized the Jews for excluding them from Scripture, yet He never does.</p>\n<p>\n\tThird, Jesus and the apostles never quote from the apocryphal books. The OT testifies of Christ, and He gives testimony to the validity of the OT by quoting from many of its books. The apostles, likewise, quote from the OT. Yet they never quote from any of the apocryphal books.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy does Jude quote the Book of Enoch then? This book was not one of the apocryphal books of which we&rsquo;re speaking; rather, it was part of the Pseudepigrapha, which were a set of supposed scripture that were universally rejected as false writing. Nevertheless, Jude mentions the book because it was well known in his day, and evidently it contained some useful information despite not begin inspired scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust because Jude quotes this book does not mean Enoch is inspired. If that logic were true, then we&rsquo;d have to say that heathen writings are also inspired. This is because Paul quotes from certain heathen poets, such as Aratus (Acts 17:28), Menander (1 Corinthians 15:33), and Epimenides (Titus 1:12). Just because Scripture quotes a truthful source does not make that source automatically inspired Scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tFourth, many Jewish scholars and early church fathers rejected the apocryphal books as canonical. Jewish writers such as Philo and Josephus, and the rabbis at the Council of Jamnia all rejected the apocryphal books as canonical. Most of the early church also rejected them, including Origen, Athanasius, Hilary, Cyril, Epiphanius, Ruffinus, and Jerome. Interestingly, cardinal Cajetan, the man the Catholic church sent to debate Luther, also rejected these books as canonical. In his commentary of the history of the OT, he writes the following:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&ldquo;Here we close our commentaries on the historical books of the old Testament. For the rest (that is, Judith, Tobit, and the books of Maccabees) are counted by St Jerome out of the canonical books, and are placed amongst the Apocrypha, along with Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus, as is plain from the Prologus Galeatus. Nor be thou disturbed, like a raw scholar, if thou shouldest find any where, either in the sacred councils or&nbsp;the sacred doctors, these books reckoned as canonical. For the words as well of councils as of doctors are to be reduced to the correction of Jerome. Now, according to his judgment, in the epistle to the bishops Chromatius and Heliodorus, these books (and any other like books in the canon of the bible) are not canonical, that is, not in the nature of a rule for confirming matters of faith. Yet, they may be called canonical, that is, in the nature of a rule for the edification of the faithful, as being received and authorized in the canon of the bible for that purpose. By the help of this distinction thou mayest see thy way clearly through that which Augustine says, and what is written in the provincial council of Carthage.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThis is interesting because not only is cardinal Cajetan a Catholic, he also provides evidence for how some viewed the apocryphal books as canonical, the most famous of which is Augustine. There is other evidence from Augustine that corroborate this view, meaning when he said the apocrypha was canonical, he did not mean it in the sense of being inspired. Rather, it was meant in the sense of being useful for edification.</p>\n<p>\n\tIndeed, Athanasius, after naming the twenty two Hebrew OT books (thirty nine in Protestant Bibles), says &ldquo;But, besides these, there are also other non-canonical books of the old Testament, which are only read to the catechumens.&rdquo;, and then he names the apocryphal books. This is why Jerome included those books in the Latin Vulgate, which he translated.</p>\n<p>\n\tFifth, some apocryphal books contain many historical and geographical inaccuracies. As we have shown in our prior study on the inspiration of Scripture, the Bible does not contain such inaccuracies. These errors prove the books that contain them are non- canonical. Some of the errors are shown below:</p>\n<p>\n\t- There are several inconsistencies in the additions to Esther, one of which in chapter 6 mentions Ptolemy and Cleopatra. Both lived after the times of Mordecai, so including these two later historical figures clearly shows this addition was written well after Esther was completed. In addition, the added chapters were written in Greek, not Hebrew.<br />\n\t<br />\n\t- In the book of Judith, Holofernes is incorrectly described as the general of &ldquo;Nebuchadnezzar who ruled over the Assyrians in the great city of Ninevah&rdquo; (1:1). In truth, Holofernes was a Persian general, and Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tSixth, the apocryphal books often contradict Scripture. Examples include:</p>\n<p>\n\t- The Book of Tobit teaches magic (Tobit 6:4,6-8). The Bible clearly condemns magical practices such as this (consider Deuteronomy 18:10-12; Leviticus 19:26,31; Jeremiah 27:9; Malachi 3:5).</p>\n<p>\n\t- 2 Maccabees 12:43-45 states: &ldquo;He also took up a collection ... and sent it to Jerusalem to provide for a sin offering. ... For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen asleep would arise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead ... Therefore he made atonement for the dead, that they might be delivered from their sin.&rdquo; This teaches prayers for the dead, as well as salvation by works, both of which contradict Scripture. Hebrews 9:27 makes clear that judgment&nbsp;comes after death, while numerous Scriptures clearly show that salvation is solely by faith in Christ alone.</p>\n<p>\n\t- The Book of Tobit 12:9 states: &ldquo;For almsgiving delivers from death, and it will purge away every sin.&rdquo; This clearly contradicts Scripture (e.g., Leviticus 17:11, Titus 3:5, Romans 4 and 5, etc.).<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tSeventh, the apocryphal books were never accepted by the church until the Council of Trent. Roughly 1,500 years after these books were written, the Catholic church decided to &ldquo;officially&rdquo; recognize the apocrypha as Scripture. As we&rsquo;ve seen above, these books were not accepted as canonical Scripture by either the Jews or the early Christian church. It is clear that the Catholic church adopted these books as canonical in opposition to Protestantism, as some of the apocrypha (falsely) supported Catholicism&rsquo;s teaching regarding salvation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, no apocryphal book makes the claim that it is the word of God. While most OT books do claim to be God&rsquo;s word, none of the apocrypha claim this status.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile some of the apocryphal books are useful, especially from a historical perspective, it&rsquo;s clear they are not inspired, and therefore do not belong in the OT canon. We encourage believers to read these books, however, so they can judge for themselves as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou may also be interested in another article on <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/how_do_we_know_the_bible_is_accurate/\">why we can trust the BIble</a>.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. I know from your studies that the Bible teaches God is sovereign in the salvation of humanity, but where do free will teachers find Biblical support for their views?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. \"Free will\" theology is the view that faith in the Gospel is a matter of personal choice unrelated to the work of God in the heart. Free will believes that nothing is required to cause faith in the Gospel other than a person&#39;s choice to believe.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the teaching of the Bible. Apart from Adam and Woman (and Christ), no human being has been born with a truly free will. On the contrary, Paul says all men since Adam are born ensalved to sin and cannot choose nor please God by their fallen nature. At the moment the Lord acts to bring&nbsp;faith, the person is born again by the Spirit and is made&nbsp;a slave to Christ.&nbsp;[For helpful background on what the Bible teaches concerning saving faith, please read <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/wrestling_with_god/\"><strong>Wrestling With God</strong></a>.]</p>\n\n<p>Our prideful nature assumes (and prefers to believe) that we played a part, however small, in our own salvation. We point to our decision to believe in the Gospel as the moment we \"chose\" Christ, yet the Bible says plainly that He chose us:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 1:3 &nbsp;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Eph. 1:4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Eph. 1:5 He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Eph. 1:6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The false teaching that salvation is a product of man&#39;s&nbsp;\"free\" will is nothing new within the Church. Even in Paul&#39;s day men were confused and misled over the origins of their faith and the manner of salvation.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Paul&#39;s first letter to the church in Corinth begins with a teaching on the sovereignty of God in choosing believers from among the lessor classes of society to shame the strong and powerful. Paul wrote this chapter to dispell the myth in Corinth that men were coming to faith in the Lord because of their associations with the \"right\" teacher (i.e., Paul vs. Apollos), which was a type of free will heresy:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 1:26 &nbsp;For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;<br />\n1Cor. 1:27 but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of&nbsp; the world to shame the things which are strong,<br />\n1Cor. 1:28 and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the things that are,<br />\n1Cor. 1:29 so that no man may boast before God.<br />\n1Cor. 1:30 But&nbsp; by His doing you are in&nbsp; Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and&nbsp; sanctification, and redemption,<br />\n1Cor. 1:31 so that, just as it is written, &ldquo;LET HIM WHO BOASTS, BOAST IN THE LORD.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Notice Paul says in v.30 that the believers in Corinth were \"in Christ Jesus\" (i.e., they were believers) not because of Paul&#39;s doing or even their own free will, but by \"His doing\" they were believers. It was Christ&#39;s doing that caused the men in Corinth to accept the Gospel. Their faith was not a result of each man&#39;s own will; it came as a matter of God&#39;s will.</p>\n\n<p>Paul taught this same principle in Romans, when he&nbsp;says:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 9:16 &nbsp;So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>In the context of Romans 9, Paul is talking about how men receive God&#39;s mercy. Paul says God&#39;s mercy doesn&#39;t depend on a man&#39;s will, nor does it depend on how a man \"runs,\" which refers to his life&#39;s works. Rather, it depends entirely on God, the One Who extends mercy according to His will.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Paul taught the church in Corinth that men are not naturally reception to the Gospel message:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 1:18 &nbsp;For the word of the cross is foolishness to&nbsp; those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Men do not accept the Gospel by their will because our fallen nature is spiritually opposed to God and therefore can never seek for God:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 3:10 as it is written,<br />\n&ldquo; THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;<br />\nRom. 3:11 THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS,<br />\nTHERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;<br />\nRom. 3:12 ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS;<br />\nTHERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD,<br />\nTHERE IS NOT EVEN ONE.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Since men lack the capacity to seek God and accept the Gospel, God must initiate faith in the heart to bring men to Himself, as Paul explains in Ephesians:</p>\n\n<h6>Eph. 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;<br />\nEph. 2:9&nbsp; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.<br />\nEph. 2:10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>We can only assume this false doctrine (like all false teashing) originated with Satan, since \"free will\" salvation is a teaching that mirrors the first lie told in the Garden. Just as Woman and Adam were called to \"be like God\" and to determine the course of their own future independent of God&#39;s will, likewise the enemy is determined to corrupt the Church with a message of self-reliance and independence from God, even in the matter of grace and salvation.</p>\n\n<p>Many Biblical references are cited by those advocating free will salvation, but these citations are always taken out of context, misinterpreted and misapplied. We could show many examples, but let&#39;s examine one of the most common. John 3:16 is commonly cited as \"proof\" of free will salvation and the opportunity for every person to believe if they choose:</p>\n\n<h6>John 3:16&nbsp; &ldquo;For God so&nbsp; loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>To the ears of a free will advocate, Jesus seems to be saying that salvation is equally possible for every person, but this interpretation does not fit Jesus&#39; words, especially in the context of John 3 overall. In 3:16 Jesus declares that the means of salvation is belief in Him, and the outcome of belief is eternal life, so that anyone who takes the step of belief will be saved.</p>\n\n<p>Free will teachers have made the (false) assumption that Jesus was defining who could be saved (i.e., everyone has equal opportunity to believe), but in reality Jesus was speaking only about the <em>manner</em> of salvation (i.e., salvation is by faith in Christ). Jesus&#39; statement has nothing to teach regarding who <em>might</em> be inclined toward saving faith.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In fact if we simply read a little further in the same chapter, we can see clearly Jesus teaching that saving faith is a consequence of God&#39;s choice not man&#39;s will. Two verses later, Jesus states that if saving faith is evident in a person&#39;s heart, it is evidence that God has chosen to open the heart and appoint the person to faith. But when faith does not come, it is evidence that the person has been judged by God already:</p>\n\n<h6>John 3:17 &ldquo;For God&nbsp; did not send the Son into the world&nbsp; to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.<br />\nJohn 3:18 &ldquo; He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Notice that Jesus expands on His comments in John 3:16 by reminding us that those who do not accept the opportunity to believe and be saved are showing evidence that they have been \"judged already\" by God. According to Jesus, the inclination to believe (or not believe) was a reflection of the Father&#39;s sovereign will for that individual.</p>\n\n<p>We could point to numerous other scripture references commonly cited to support free will teaching and uncover in a similar fashion how each is misapplied and misinterpreted out of context to support a free will viewpoint, but time does not permit such an exhaustive examination. We trust the Holy Spirit will reveal the truth of these matters to you in the course of your personal studies.</p>\n\n<p>To fully appreciate this difficult topic, we highly recommend you listen to our <strong><a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans Bible study</a></strong>, where Paul deals with these issues in detail.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Since the Law of Moses requires Jews to sacrifice in a tabernacle or temple, how do devout Jews satisify requirement today without a temple? Do their hearts condemn them?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Every unbelieving Jew remains under the Old Covenant and the Law it contains, including the requirement to observe the rites and sacrifices in the temple. Obviously, this requirement poses a serious dilemma for any Jew who wishes to remain orthodox and obedient to the Law. WIthout a temple, the Jewish people are prevented from observing the sacrifices as required by the Law. Therefore, they are forced to live in a consant state of disobedience to the Old Covenant.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis situation has persisted since the destruction of the temple in AD 70, and there is no solution for their problem except to have faith in Messiah and come out from under the Law. Therefore they live in a perpetual state of frustration and concern over their plight. Perhaps a pious Jew finds some consolation in knowing their disobedience is involuntary, having been prevented from obeying by circumstances beyond their control.</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, this situation was exactly what the Lord intended when He called for the destruction of the temple in Matthew 24:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLuke 21:20 &nbsp;&ldquo;But when you see Jerusalem&nbsp; surrounded by armies, then&nbsp; recognize that her desolation is near.<br />\n\tLuke 21:21 &ldquo;Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those who are in the midst of&nbsp; the city must leave, and&nbsp; those who are in the country must not enter&nbsp; the city;<br />\n\tLuke 21:22 &nbsp;because these are&nbsp; days of vengeance, so that all things which are written will be fulfilled.<br />\n\tLuke 21:23 &nbsp;&ldquo;Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days; for&nbsp; there will be great distress upon the&nbsp; land and wrath to this people;<br />\n\tLuke 21:24 &nbsp;and they will fall by&nbsp; the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations; and&nbsp; Jerusalem will be&nbsp; trampled under foot by the Gentiles until&nbsp; the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe destruction of the temple and the elimination of any opportunity to partiicpate in the sacrificial system was a situation the Lord Himself instituted to send a message regarding the Old Covenant. As the writer of Hebrews taught:</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 8:13&nbsp; When He said, &ldquo;A new covenant,&rdquo; He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 9:8&nbsp; The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing,<br />\n\tHeb. 9:9 which is a symbol for the present time.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe Old Covenant earned its name because a new and better covenant was intended to replace it. The OT Law established the existence of the temple, and so for as long as the temple existed, the writer says, it was an indication to saints that the new had not yet come. But once the new covenant had been given, the Old Covenant and the temple it established were eliminated to show that they were no longer needed.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, the Lord worked through the Romans to destroy the temple after Christ&#39;s arrival. He does not want the Jew to continue seeking the Lord in a temple and through a Law that were fulfilled in Christ and no longer needed. Their collective frustration in trying to observe a Law absent a temple is part of God&#39;s plan to frustrated the nation of Israel during this time of hardening, as Paul wrote:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 11:7&nbsp; What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened;<br />\n\t<br />\n\tRom. 11:11&nbsp; I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>"

Should a woman with a husband who is abusive to her or her children not stand in opposition to his behavior?&nbsp; Should she submit to her husband if it means participating in his ungodly behavior?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The Bible teaches that the man is the head of the woman in terms of spiritual authority, as Paul writes:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Cor. 11:3 &nbsp;But I want you to understand that&nbsp; Christ is the&nbsp; head of every man, and&nbsp; the man is the head of a woman, and God is the&nbsp; head of&nbsp; Christ.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tTherefore, scripture teaches that a woman is under the spiritual authority of her husband (or her father prior to marriage). The Bible uses Sarah, the wife of Abraham, as an example to all women for how a woman may display godliness and submission to a husband even when he is imperfect and prone to sinful mistakes.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeter writes:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Pet. 3:1&nbsp; In the same way, you wives,&nbsp; be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be&nbsp; won without a word by the behavior of their wives,<br />\n\t1Pet. 3:2 as they observe your chaste and&nbsp; respectful behavior.<br />\n\t1Pet. 3:3&nbsp; Your adornment must not be merely external &mdash; braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses;<br />\n\t1Pet. 3:4 but let it be&nbsp; the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.<br />\n\t1Pet. 3:5 For in this way in former times the holy women also,&nbsp; who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands;<br />\n\t1Pet. 3:6 just as Sarah obeyed Abraham,&nbsp; calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right&nbsp;&nbsp; without being frightened by any fear.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tPeter&#39;s main point is that a woman should remain obedient to her husband&#39;s authority even when he disobeys the word of the Lord. She does so in the hope that her obedience might win her husband over to the truth. In the story of Abraham and Sarah, we learn that she was asked (twice) to conceal her true identity to support her husband&#39;s wishes. In the first occasion, we read:</p>\n<h5>\n\tGen. 12:10&nbsp; Now there was&nbsp; a famine in the land; so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was&nbsp; severe in the land.<br />\n\tGen. 12:11 It came about when he&nbsp; came near to Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, &ldquo;See now, I know that you are a&nbsp;&nbsp; beautiful woman;<br />\n\tGen. 12:12&nbsp; and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, &lsquo;This is his wife&rsquo;; and they will kill me, but they will let you live.<br />\n\tGen. 12:13 &ldquo;Please say that you are&nbsp; my sister so that it may go well with me because of you, and that&nbsp;&nbsp; I may live on account of you.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tAbraham&#39;s plan was sinful, yet Sarah submitted to his authority without ever sinning herself, but neither did she object to her husband&#39;s request. Instead, she trusted in the Lord and waited for Him to resolve the problem on her behalf. As Peter noted, Sarah never spoke a word (v.1), and therefore she never participated in Abraham&#39;s sin, but nevertheless she still submitted to Abraham&#39;s authority in the best way possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tSarah&#39;s example is a reminder to women that God is capable of rescuing a righteous woman from her husband&#39;s misdeeds. On the other hand, the Bible never requires that a woman live in a state of \"slavery\" to her husband or tolerate physical abuse abuse, nor does it demand that a woman violate the word of God to support her husband (nor does Pastor Armstrong teach that such things are required).</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, should a woman be asked by her husband to do the wrong thing, she must seek the best possible way to submit to his authority without participating in his sin. If a husband demands his wife commit sin, she is right to refuse such a request to the extent necessary to avoid the sin. Furthermore, if a woman is subject to physical abuse, she has a right to seek protection and relief. Similarly, if a husband is abusing children, a wife is within her rights to protect the innocent.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the end, the woman&#39;s decisions must be guided first by love for God, followed by love for her husband. Still, having an imperfect husband is never reason for a wife to withhold her submission (as Sarah demonstrated), but a wife may refuse to comply when her husband&#39;s requests come into conflict with the Lord&#39;s word.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. In Matthew 5:18, Jesus said that the Law will not pass away until all is accomplished. In light of your teaching that the Law no longer has authority over the believer, what did Jesus mean?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. First, we assume you are following our Exodus study online, but we want you listen to two recent lessons (<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/exodus/exodus_lesson_20a/\">Lessons 20A &amp; 20B</a></strong>), if you haven&#39;t already.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize his teaching in this lesson, Pastor Armstrong explained that all men, both Gentile and Jew, must meet the strict demands of God&#39;s Law if they are to enter into the Lord&#39;s presence. That standard is perfection (i.e., to keep the whole Law perfectly). Since no man can meet this standard apart from Christ, every man stands condemned for their sin.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus lived a sinless life under the Law to satisfy the Law&#39;s requirements. When Jesus said the Law cannot pass away until all is accomplished, He was speaking about His role in accomplishing the Law on our behalf. Jesus died to pay&nbsp;the price required for sin under Law, though He had no sin of His own to pay. Now by our faith in His work, we are credited with Christ&#39;s perfect accomplishment of the Law. In this way, every believer is considered to have accomplished the Law on the basis of faith in Christ&#39;s work.</p>\n\n<p>That is the full meaning Jesus&#39; words when He told the Pharisees that the Law will not pass away until everything it requires has been accomplished. The Law exists to condemn men&#39;s sin, so until a person \"keeps\" the Law perfectly, the Law remains in effect to condemn him. Therefore, the Law can only \"pass away\" after it has been accomplished (or kept) perfectly. The only way a person can meet this standard is by faith in Jesus Christ&#39;s work.</p>\n\n<p>At the time Jesus spoke these words, the Pharisees were claiming that Jesus taught men to ignore (or break) the Law, but Jesus denied their accusations. He said if someone was teaching that God&#39;s Law can be freely broken, they were not fit for (i.e., \"they were least\") in the kingdom. Obviously, the truth must be the opposite. Jesus was teaching that the requirements of the Law MUST be met, BUT we can&#39;t meet them in our own ability.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s what Jesus meant when He said that our righteousness must <em>exceed</em> the Pharisees. The Pharisees were scrupulous at keeping the law (that is, breaking fewer laws than most). They were considered the highest example of righteousness in that culture. These men were incredibly pious, yet they even they&nbsp;failed to keep the Law perfectly, which is the requirement for anyone wishing to be approved by God through law-keeping.</p>\n\n<p>So when Jesus said our righteousness must <em>exceed</em> the Pharisees, He was condemning the Pharisees (since even their extreme efforts to keep the Law weren&#39;t good enough), and He was declaring to us that attempting to be righteous through keeping law is a futile effort.&nbsp;The Law demands perfection, so if someone wants to enter Heaven by works of law, they must meet an impossible standard.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when we attempt to \"keep\" the law in response to Matthew 5:18 (which is merely&nbsp;breaking&nbsp;<em>fewer</em>&nbsp;laws), we are actually doing the <em>opposite</em> of what Jesus was teaching. Jesus was speaking of Himself when He declared that all written in the Law must be accomplished. Jesus is the One Who accomplishes it all on our behalf,&nbsp;first in His perfect life, then in His sacrificial death on the cross and finally in fulfilling all prophecy concerning Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, the solution to this dilemma is not attempting to keep the Law ourselves (which will never produce&nbsp;righteousness), but rather we are credited with accomplishing all that the Law requires by faith in&nbsp;Jesus&#39; work done on our behalf.</p>"

Is this correct?</em></strong><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. While we understand your perspective, you have underestimated God&#39;s role in controlling the suffering in our lives. You believe that God does not bring suffering to people, but this is not the teaching of Scripture. On the contrary, the Bible teaches that God is in control of all suffering in the world, both the suffering brought upon us as tests and trials as well as the suffering that comes from the consequences of sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, the Scriptures make clear that all things in life - even negative experiences - fall under the sovereignty of God. He is the One Who brings all things into being.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord says:</p>\n<h5>\n\tIs. 45:5 &ldquo;I am the LORD, and there is no other;<br />\n\t&nbsp; Besides Me there is no God.<br />\n\tI will gird you, though you have not known Me;<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIs. 45:6 That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun<br />\n\tThat there is no one besides Me.<br />\n\tI am the LORD, and there is no other,<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIs. 45:7 The One forming light and creating darkness,<br />\n\tCausing&nbsp; well-being and creating calamity;<br />\n\tI am the LORD who does all these.</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tNotice that God Himself declares in His word that He is the One causing calamity in the world. While it is true that Satan is often the instrument that God uses to bring about trials and tests, nevertheless the Lord controls Satan and determines the outcome of his activities.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tYou cited the example of Job to argue that God wasn&#39;t responsible for Job&#39;s suffering, but we encourage you to take a second look at the details in that story. For example, did you notice how Job&#39;s name entered the conversation between the Lord and Satan? In Job 1 we read:</p>\n<h5>\n\tJob 1:6&nbsp; Now there was a day when the&nbsp; sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and&nbsp; Satan also came among them.<br />\n\tJob 1:7 The LORD said to Satan, &ldquo;From where do you come?&rdquo; Then Satan answered the LORD and said, &ldquo; From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.&rdquo;<br />\n\tJob 1:8 The LORD said to Satan, &ldquo;Have you&nbsp; considered&nbsp; My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth,&nbsp; a blameless and upright man,&nbsp; fearing God and turning away from evil.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tDid you notice in v.8 that it was the Lord Who introduced the name of Job? God put Job on Satan&#39;s mind, thereby leading Satan to bring calamity upon Job. Had the Lord not mentioned Job&#39;s name, Satan would never have targeted Job for torment. Furthermore, God initially restricted Satan to only taking Job&#39;s possessions, but later God expanded Satan&#39;s opportunity to inflict pain and suffering upon Job himself.</p>\n<p>\n\tClearly, the story of Job teaches that it is the Lord Who brings calamity, and He used Satan as His instrument to bring suffering to Job - even though Job was a righteous man! This is the message of James 1. Christian will face trials brought by the Lord for our benefit, and we must face those experiences with joy knowing these events lead to our spiritual growth and maturity (James 1:3).</p>\n<p>\n\tThough we may have been conditioned by the world to view all suffering as bad, the Bible teaches the truth that suffering is not bad when it is designed to produce sanctification, just as it did for Christ. Therefore, we must prepare for and accept suffering brought for the purpose of creating holiness.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, the Bible teaches that the Lord brings upon us the negative consequences of our sin (and even upon other family members) as a way of teaching the error of sin to unbelievers and for disciplining His children.&nbsp; Consider these verses:</p>\n<h5>\n\tNum. 14:18 &lsquo; The LORD is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but&nbsp; He will by no means clear the guilty,&nbsp; visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children&nbsp; to the third and the fourth generations.&rsquo;&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 12:5 and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons,<br />\n\t&ldquo; MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD,<br />\n\tNOR&nbsp; FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM;<br />\n\tHeb. 12:6&nbsp; FOR THOSE&nbsp; WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES,<br />\n\tAND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&rdquo;<br />\n\tHeb. 12:7 It is for discipline that you endure;&nbsp; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?<br />\n\tHeb. 12:8 But if you are without discipline,&nbsp; of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.<br />\n\tHeb. 12:9 Furthermore, we had&nbsp; earthly fathers to discipline us, and we&nbsp; respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to&nbsp; the Father of&nbsp; spirits, and&nbsp; live?<br />\n\tHeb. 12:10 For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good,&nbsp; so that we may share His holiness.<br />\n\tHeb. 12:11 All discipline&nbsp; for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the&nbsp; peaceful fruit of righteousness.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIn Numbers, Moses says that the Lord will \"visit\" the sins of one generation into later generations. The word for \"visit\" is paqad in Hebrew. This word literally means to \"appoint\" indicating that the Lord is actively bringing about this outcome. When a father or a mother makes sinful choices (like pursuing addictive behaviors), then the Lord may appoint the consequences of their sin to later generations. We see evidence of this pattern in the world around us as the sinful choices of fathers and mothers often bring hardship and suffering to their children. The Bible says these consequences are under God&#39;s control.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, the letter to the Hebrews teaches how the Lord responds to sin of believers.&nbsp; The writer says the Lord brings \"discipline\" to His sons. In this context, discipline refers to the suffering we experience as a result of our disobedience to God. In v.6 the Lord says He \"scourges\" every son. The word for scourge refers to a whipping, or as we would say today, a spanking.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, you mentioned that you would never bring negative consequences to your children when they sin, but the Bible teaches in Hebrews 12:9 that good earthly fathers <strong>should</strong> bring discipline (i.e., negative consequences) to their children when they disobey. In fact, Hebrews 12:8 that if we fail to bring discipline against our children, we treat them as if they weren&#39;t our children at all! We treat them like they belong to someone else (i.e., illegitimate children). Since our Father in Heaven is perfect, He will always do the good and loving thing: He will bring negative consequences to us for our sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, the Bible teaches that God is sovereign over all that happens in His creation, and though He is never the author of sin, nevertheless He does bring calamity, trials and consequences for sin to both unbelievers and believers in order to accomplish His good purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are interested in learning more about what the Bible says about God&#39;s sovereignty, we recommend you listen to our series on the sovereignty of God called <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_sovereignty_of_god/\">Thy Will Above Thy Name</a></strong>.</p>"

Every time the BIble discusses the holding place for the spirits of unbelievers, it speaks of a place \"in the earth\" and \"below\" us. For example, consider this OT reference to the place of the ungodly after death (called Sheol in the OT):</p>\n<h5>\n\tNum. 16:30 &ldquo;But&nbsp; if the LORD&nbsp; brings about an entirely new thing and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that is theirs, and they&nbsp; descend alive into&nbsp; Sheol, then you will understand that these men have spurned the LORD.&rdquo;<br />\n\tNum. 16:31&nbsp; As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split open;<br />\n\tNum. 16:32 and&nbsp; the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and&nbsp; all the men who belonged to Korah with their possessions.<br />\n\tNum. 16:33 So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to&nbsp; Sheol; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tNotice these men were sent to Hell, and they went \"down\" and the earth \"closed over them.\" These are clear indications that Hell is below our feet. Likewise, every other reference to death and the afterlife in the Old Testament indicates that the holding place for the dead is below our feet in the earth.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the New Testament, Jesus was said to go down when He went into the grave:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 4:7&nbsp; But&nbsp; to each one of us&nbsp; grace was given&nbsp; according to the measure of Christ&rsquo;s gift.<br />\n\tEph. 4:8 Therefore&nbsp; it says,<br />\n\t&ldquo; WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH,<br />\n\tHE&nbsp; LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES,<br />\n\tAND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.&rdquo;<br />\n\tEph. 4:9 (Now this expression, &ldquo;He&nbsp; ascended,&rdquo; what&nbsp; does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?<br />\n\tEph. 4:10 He who descended is Himself also He who ascended&nbsp; far above all the heavens, so that He might&nbsp; fill all things.)</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus descended into the lower parts of the earth, Paul says.</p>\n<p>\n\tRemember, scientists might dispute our Biblical view, but in reality they have no idea what exists in the center of the earth. We&#39;ve never penetrated more than a few miles into the Earth&#39;s crust. Based on the word of God, Hell (or Hades) is below our feet.</p>"

In your Genesis teaching, you taught that the Nephilim in chapter 6 all died in the Flood, but the ten spies&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>claimed to see&nbsp;Nephilim in the land after the Exodus. How could the spies have seen Nephilim in Canaan if they all died in the flood?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA. The report of the ten spies was not a truthful report. Scripture confirms that the unfaithful spies delivered lies to Moses and the people, because they were afraid they would die in trying to take the land as God directed. We read of their lies in Numbers 13:</p>\n\n<h5>Num. 13:31 But the men who had gone up with him said, &ldquo; We are not able to go up against the people, for they are too strong for us.&rdquo;<br />\nNum. 13:32 So they gave out to the sons of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, &ldquo;The land through which we have gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its&nbsp; inhabitants; and&nbsp; all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size.<br />\nNum. 13:33 &ldquo;There also we saw the&nbsp; Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and&nbsp; we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In v.32 scripture says the sons of Israel give a \"bad report.\" The word for bad in Hebrew is <em>dibbah</em>, which literally translates as defamation or slander. You can find the same Hebrew word used Psalms 31:13 and in Proverbs 10:18. Slander is a lie intended to harm, and this is what the spies delivered.&nbsp;Therefore, Scripture testifies that the spies were slandering (lying) when they reported what they saw in the land.</p>\n\n<p>We can also see that their report was untrue by comparing their report to what we know Joshua found when the nation of Israel finally entered the land forty years later. When Joshua enters the land, the land of Canaan did not devour the nation of Israel as the spies reported it would. Furthermore, the men of Canaan were not giants in size, as the spies reported, nor were Nephilim found in the land.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the report of Nephilim was not a truthful report. It was a lie designed to convince the Israelites to remain outside the land. For this lie and their unbelief, the spies along with that generation of Israel were condemned to die in the desert.</p>\n\n<p>You may also be interested in the following question:&nbsp;<a href=\"/bible-answers/how_did_fallen_angels_and_humans_produce_nephilim\">How did fallen angels and humans produce Nephilim?</a></p>"

You teach that the reference to Lucifer in Isaiah 14:12 is speaking of Satan, but the word \"Lucifer\" is the latin word for \"morning star.\" 2 Peter calls Jesus the Morning Star, so isn&#39;t Isaiah 14 talking about Jesus and not Satan?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. While it is true that the word \"lucifer\" means \"morning star\" in Latin, this does not mean that every mention of a morning star in Scripture is a reference to Christ. Remember, Scripture tells us that Satan comes as an \"angel of light,\" and therefore at times he passes himself off as the Morning Star, that is Christ. Scripture acknowledges this pattern by assigning Satan the messianic term \"morning star\" in a mocking manner.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause the phrase \"morning star\" (or lucifer) is used both as a description of Christ and of Satan, we must rely on the context of each use to help us determine the meaning. The rules for proper interpretation of scripture require that the context drive our understanding of the meaning of a single word; a single word doesn not drive our understanding of the context.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Isaiah 14:12, we read:</p>\n<h5>\n\tIs. 14:12 &ldquo;How you have&nbsp; fallen from heaven,<br />\n\tO star of the morning, son of the dawn!<br />\n\tYou have been cut down to the earth,<br />\n\tYou who have weakened the nations!<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn the Latin Vulgate translation, the word for \"star of the morning\" in Isaiah 14:12 is the word \"lucifer.\" Who is Isaiah describing in v.12? To answer that question, we must consider the entire context of Isaiah 14. As we look at that chapter, we find abundant evidence that the entire chapter is describing Satan&#39;s fall.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, Isaiah 14 also calls this individual the \"king of Babylon\" (v.4), which is a reference to Satan and never Christ. Furthermore, this person is welcomed into Sheol to lie on a bed of maggots (v.11), which is not something prepared for Christ. Also, in v.14 Lucifer is accused of weakening the nations (not something Christ did), and in v.20 he is accused of slaying his people (not something Christ did). Simply put, it is impossible to conclude from the context of Isaiah 14 that Lucifer is a reference to Christ. We must conclude it refers to Satan.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn summary, we must guide our understanding of the word lucifer by the context in which it appears. In Isaiah 14, the context clearly shows this word used to describe Satan. On the othe hand, 2Peter is clearly using the term to describe Christ, as you pointed out. There is nothing surprising nor troubling about the Bible using the same word to refer to two different people or concepts.&nbsp;</p>"

The Biblical record provides only a glimpse of Noah&#39;s activities in the days leading up the flood, and most of the narrative in Genesis is focused on his work in building the ark. Nevetheless, we can make a reasonable assumption that Noah preached about the coming flood to his neighbors and community during the 100 years required to complete the ark.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, we know from Genesis 6 that Noah was a blameless man, which means he lived a godly lifestyle before others. Furthermore, 2Peter 2 tells us Noah was a preacher of righteousness:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Pet. 2:5 and did not spare&nbsp; the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tKnowing that Noah was a preacher proclaiming God&#39;s truth in some form to the people of his day and given his godly character, we can assume Noah preached about the approaching flood and the need to repent.&nbsp;Furthermore, offering the world such a warning would be in keeping with God&#39;s character, since God typically gives opportunity for repentance prior to His judgments.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf Noah did warn the world, the world obviously chose to ignore his warnings, because the Bible teaches that the world was taken by surprise when the flood came. The fact that the world was caught off guard by the flood does not prove that Noah never preached concerning the coming judgment. It only tells us that the world paid no attention to the warnings.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, men have heard warnings from many prophets over the ages, yet they usually ignore the warnings and are caught off guard by the judgment that follows. The entire history of the nation of Israel testifies to this truth.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, Matthew 24 goes on to record Jesus Himself warning our world of another coming judgment, His Second Coming. Nevertheless, Jesus says the world will be caught off guard when He returns:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 24:37 &ldquo;For&nbsp; the&nbsp; coming of the Son of Man will be&nbsp; just like the days of Noah.<br />\n\tMatt. 24:38 &ldquo;For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking,&nbsp; marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that&nbsp; Noah entered the ark,<br />\n\tMatt. 24:39 and they did not&nbsp; understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the&nbsp; coming of the Son of Man be.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tNotice, the world will be surprised by the Second Coming despite the Bible&#39;s many warnings (often repeated by preachers throughout the centuries) that this event will lead to judgment for the ungodly. If Jesus&#39; warnings will be ignored before His Second Coming, then certainly Noah&#39;s warnings could have been ignored by his world before the flood.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Does the Bible teach a doctrine of \"covering\" (that one must be \"covered\" by a spiritual authority higher up in the spiritual chain of command in order to be protected, blessed, etc.)? I see no such doctrine in Scripture.</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The Bible does not teach a specific \"covering\" doctrine, at least not in the way you described it. Rather, the Bible teaches that all men and women are under authority, both in the church and in society, and therefore Christians are expected to obey and respect all authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpecifically, the body of Christ should honor the leaders in their life. For example, Hebrews says:</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 13:17&nbsp;&nbsp; Obey your leaders and submit to them, for&nbsp; they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account.&nbsp; Let them do this with joy and not&nbsp; with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, Paul admonishes the church to submit to human institutions of authority in Romans 13:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 13:1&nbsp; Every person is to be in&nbsp; subjection to the governing authorities. For&nbsp; there is no authority except&nbsp; from God, and those which exist are established by God.<br />\n\tRom. 13:2 Therefore&nbsp; whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn both cases, the writers connect our obedience with spiritual profit. The Hebrews writer says if we make it difficult for our leaders to fulfill their responsibilities, we will be the losers. Our leaders&#39; skills in teaching and counseling us will ultimately lead to a better outcome on our judgment day in eternity. On the other hand, if we resist authority in the church, we may fall into a state of rebellion and sin, leading to an unprofitable outcome on the day of our judgment (<em>see 1Cor 3</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, Paul says that if we make a habit of resisting human government, we are likely to feel the sting of human justice, since those who oppose human government are opposing God Himself.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn general, godliness in life will bring a blessing while ungodliness results in consequences, including potentially divine judgment. Nevertheless, we are concerned anytime men promise \"blessing\" to those who adhere to their rules. That kind of thinking eventually leads to cults. The Bible&#39;s command that we submit to human authority is not intended to set the rule of men above the law of God.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, Christians must submit to the authority of the Spirit and God&#39;s Word. These trump all earthly authority in matters of righteousness and godliness. When the expectations of the Spirit and the Word conflict with the demands of men, we must obey God and endure the consequences that follow (just like Jesus did).</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I lead a small bible study group, and I noticed some students struggle to understanding Scripture. Is there anything I can do to help them understand more easily?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Teaching the Bible is honorable and challenging work, and we commend you for your dedication to this important ministry. Obviously, it&#39;s difficult for us to address exactly what may be holding some of your students back in their understanding of scripture, but before you blame yourself for their difficulty, remember not all students learn at the same rate for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, here are some questions to consider in evaluating your situation:</p>\n<p>\n\t1. All all participants believers? Do you know that each person in your group has, in fact, come to faith in the Gospel? As you mentioned, the Holy Spirit is our Teacher, therefore only believers are capable of understanding scripture, since only believers have the Holy Spirit working in their hearts.&nbsp; Paul taught this when he said:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Cor. 2:12 Now we&nbsp; have received, not the spirit of&nbsp; the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God,<br />\n\t1Cor. 2:13 which things we also speak,&nbsp; not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.<br />\n\t1Cor. 2:14&nbsp; But a natural man&nbsp; does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are&nbsp; foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually&nbsp; appraised.<br />\n\t1Cor. 2:15 But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one.<br />\n\t1Cor. 2:16 For&nbsp; WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT HIM? But&nbsp; we have the mind of Christ.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIf someone is struggling to understand scripture, it may be a sign that this person has attached himself to the church as a club or social event, but he has never personally come to faith in Jesus as his Savior. You can rule out this cause through some simple questions or by asking the individual to give their testimony, and then listen carefully to hear what they say. If they don&#39;t have a testimony of faith in Christ, then you should work to explain the truth of Jesus to them and then encourage them to be baptized (by immersion, as a response to their faith).</p>\n<p>\n\t2. In many places today, the Church has abandoned the practice of teaching the BIble systematically, so many Christians are weak in their scholarship of scripture and their Biblical knowledge. As a result, many find it difficult to understand basic Bible concepts. The writer of Hebrews warns that this weakening is a result of failing to pursue Biblical maturity:</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 5:11&nbsp; Concerning&nbsp; him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.<br />\n\tHeb. 5:12 For though&nbsp; by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the&nbsp; oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.<br />\n\tHeb. 5:13 For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of righteousness, for he is an&nbsp; infant.<br />\n\tHeb. 5:14 But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have their senses&nbsp; trained to&nbsp; discern good and evil.<br />\n\tHeb. 6:1&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp; leaving&nbsp; the&nbsp; elementary teaching about the&nbsp; Christ, let us press on to&nbsp;&nbsp; maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from&nbsp; dead works and of faith toward God,<br />\n\tHeb. 6:2 of&nbsp; instruction about washings and&nbsp; laying on of hands, and the&nbsp; resurrection of the dead and&nbsp; eternal judgment.<br />\n\tHeb. 6:3 And this we will do, if God permits.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIf you believe your students&#39; difficulty is due to lack of experience, then you should focus on teaching \"milk,\" which are the basic principles of scripture outlined in vs.1-2.&nbsp; Once these principles have been addressed, then the student will be in a better position to learn the more difficult concepts.</p>\n<p>\n\t3. Timing is everything. Not everything we study will be made clear to us in the first reading. The Spirit won&#39;t necessarily reveal the same thing to each student in your class, so your students should be told that it&#39;s OK to remain unclear on something, despite your best efforts to communicate the text&#39;s meaning. We all must be content to wait on the Spirit and allow Him to reveal what He chooses.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I have been a Christian for several years, but I struggle with sexual sin. I have tried to discipline myself, but I fall easily. I can&#39;t seem to rise above this sin in my life. Why does Scripture tells us to walk before God in holiness when it seems impossible to do so? Paul often tells the church to live a life of purity, but I can&#39;t find a way to \"white-knuckle\" my way through my temptations. How do we rise above these problems?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Unfortunately, sin in the life of every Christian is a reality. Scripture reflects this reality clearly, especially in Paul&#39;s letter to the Romans:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 7:14&nbsp; For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin.<br />\n\tRom. 7:15 &nbsp;For what I am doing,&nbsp; I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.<br />\n\tRom. 7:16 &nbsp;But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with&nbsp; the Law, confessing that the Law is good.<br />\n\tRom. 7:17 &nbsp;So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.<br />\n\tRom. 7:18 &nbsp;For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.<br />\n\tRom. 7:19 &nbsp;For&nbsp; the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.<br />\n\tRom. 7:20 &nbsp;But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.<br />\n\tRom. 7:21 &nbsp;I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good.<br />\n\tRom. 7:22 &nbsp;For I joyfully concur with the law of God&nbsp; in&nbsp; the inner man,<br />\n\tRom. 7:23 &nbsp;but I see a different law in&nbsp; the members of my body, waging war against the&nbsp; law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members.<br />\n\tRom. 7:24 &nbsp;Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death?<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tObviously, Paul himself understood what it was like to sin (repeatedly) and yet feel remorse and regret over it. Paul explains that our physical bodies (i.e., our flesh) cannot be salvaged. It is corrupt and will forever seek to rebel against God&#39;s law. This is the sin that is within each of us, and it is at war with our new spirit, which wants to obey God and follow Him.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul asks in v.24 how will we ever be set free from this sinful body, so that we might once and forever do away with our sinfulness and follow God perfectly? The answer comes in the next verse:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 7:25&nbsp; Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tChrist Himself will do away with our bodies on the day of our resurrection, when we receive a new eternal body without sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tYour struggle with sin is not unique and not new. Every Christian faces it, though not all admit it. God declares in His word that we should strive to walk before Him and be blameless, that is to be seen as Christ&#39;s righteousness in the eyes of the world. This we do by faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the source of our righteousness, and having come to faith, we gain confidence that the Lord will complete this good work in us over time:</p>\n<h5>\n\tPhil. 1:6 &nbsp;For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until&nbsp; the day of Christ Jesus.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, God&#39;s call to holiness is an encouraging call that understands our weaknesses but demands that we strive against sin. If you think you have tried hard enough already to resist temptation, the writer of Hebrews reminds us that we haven&#39;t tried as hard as our Master did:</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 12:3&nbsp; For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.<br />\n\tHeb. 12:4&nbsp; You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin;<br />\n\tHeb. 12:5 &nbsp;and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons,<br />\n\t&ldquo; MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD,<br />\n\tNOR&nbsp; FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM;<br />\n\tHeb. 12:6&nbsp; FOR THOSE&nbsp; WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES,<br />\n\tAND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&rdquo;<br />\n\tHeb. 12:7 &nbsp;It is for discipline that you endure;&nbsp; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?<br />\n\tHeb. 12:8 &nbsp;But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.<br />\n\tHeb. 12:9 &nbsp;Furthermore, we had&nbsp; earthly fathers to discipline us, and we&nbsp; respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and&nbsp; live?<br />\n\tHeb. 12:10 &nbsp;For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.<br />\n\tHeb. 12:11 &nbsp;All discipline&nbsp; for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.<br />\n\tHeb. 12:12&nbsp; Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble,<br />\n\tHeb. 12:13 &nbsp;and&nbsp; make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather&nbsp; be healed.<br />\n\tHeb. 12:14 &nbsp;Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe writer exhorts us to not lose heart or grow weary thinking we&#39;ve tried hard enough already. The writer says that unless we have worked as hard in the face of sin and temptation as Jesus did in sweating drops of blood while He prayed in the garden on the Mount of Olives, then we can&#39;t say we&#39;ve tried hard enough.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus was faced with a real temptation to disobey the Father&#39;s desire to die on the cross, yet Jesus resisted that temptation to the point of sweating blood. Still, Jesus did not give into that temptation. Now that Jesus lives in us, we gain His power to resist temptation if only we yield to Him rather than working in our own limited strength.&nbsp;The writer goes on to tell us that when we fail in the face of our temptations, the Father will respond in love by disciplining us, but His discipline will eventually lead to peaceful fruit of righteousness.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as you struggle with temptations for sexual acts or other sin, recognize that you are a child of God by faith and your sin will not separate you from God.&nbsp;Secondly, your Lord faced temptation too, yet He persevered, so He has the ability to ensure you withstand the trails (though you will not be perfect in your present body). Finally, you can expect consequences for your sin in the form of God&#39;s discipline, which will bring you into conformance with His will over time.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, we are not supposed to engage in these battles alone. \"White-knucking\" is not the solution to facing the power of sin, since it doesn&#39;t work, as you discovered. Instead, find a close, trusting relationship with another brother in the church who will stand with you in these temptations and trials. Establish a system of communication where you can reach out to this person when temptation strikes or have him arrange to check on you daily to encourage you and ensure accountability. With the help and encouragement of this person, you may find it much easier to live in the Spirit.</p>\n<p>\n\tGod gives us others in the body to strength us. Notice in Heb 12:12-12 the writer says we are to strengthen the feet and knees of the feeble and weak. This is a reference to others in the church coming along side those with struggles to ensure everyone stands approved in the day of Christ Jesus.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

When Hebrews 4 says that Jesus, our High Priest, passed through the heavens, does this mean Jesus spent time in purgatory before He entered Heaven?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. In Hebrews 4:14, the writer says that Jesus is a high priest Who passed through the heavens. The Greek word for Heavens is <em>ouranos</em>, which can mean the air, the universe or Heaven. Given the context of Hebrews 4, the author is using the word to mean the earthly atmosphere and the universe.</p>\n\n<p>The writer is saying that our High Priest passed through the heavens as he departed this world and entered directly into the throne room of God. Notice in v.14 the writer says that Jesus passed \"through\" the heavens. Passing through means He didn&#39;t stop along the way, This confirms that the heavens were not Jesus&#39; final destination or even a temporary stopping place. The writer was emphasizing that our High Priest crossed over from the world of men to the world of God to represent us in that place.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, there is no such place as \"purgatory.\" This teaching is a false concept invented by men and in conflict with the Bible and with the true Gospel. The Catholic church invented the concept of purgatory to accommodate their theology of faith plus works.</p>\n\n<p>The Catholic heresy of purgatory supposes that we gain entry to Heaven by a combination of faith in Christ plus our righteous works. The heresy teaches that if at death&nbsp;a person has failed to obtain sufficient personal righteousness through good works, then they cannot enter Heaven. Instead, the person must be \"purged\" of remaining unrighteousness prior to entering Heaven. The place of their purging is called Purgatory.</p>\n\n<p>This concept is an invention of men and not one found in the Bible. In fact, it is completely contrary to the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches that men are saved by faith <strong>alone</strong> and not by our works:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:8 &nbsp;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;<br />\nEph. 2:9&nbsp; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>No works are required for salvation, because our works cannot produce personal righteousness or holiness:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 3:20 &nbsp;because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.<br />\nRom. 3:28&nbsp; For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Furthermore, men can claim no righteousness of our own, according to Scripture. Our righteousness is given to us by Christ:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 4:1&nbsp; What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather&nbsp; according to the flesh, has found?<br />\nRom. 4:2 &nbsp;For if Abraham was justified&nbsp; by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.<br />\nRom. 4:3 &nbsp;For what does the Scripture say? &ldquo;ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&rdquo;<br />\nRom. 4:4 &nbsp;Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.<br />\nRom. 4:5 &nbsp;But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Our faith is credited to us as Christ&#39;s righteousness, so we have no need for a righteousness of our own:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 10:10 &nbsp;for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, there is no such place as purgatory, for all who believe in Christ are made righteous and enter Heaven upon their death, while those who do not believe remain in their sin and perish eternally.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on the true, biblical view of life after death, please read the <a href=\"/bible-answers/explain_where_we_go_when_we_die\">following article</a>.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. Why is watching pornography considered a sin?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The Bible makes clear watching pornography is sinful. First, the very word pornography comes from a Greek word <em>porneia</em>, which is translated sexual immorality in our English Bibles. Believers are commanded repeatedly in the New Testament to flee from all kinds of&nbsp;sexual immorality and impurity. Consider these uses of the word <em>porneia</em> in the New Testament:</p>\n\n<h5>Gal. 5:19 &nbsp;Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: <em><strong>immorality</strong></em>, impurity, sensuality,<br />\n<br />\nEph. 5:3 &nbsp;But <em><strong>immorality</strong></em> or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;<br />\n<br />\n1Th. 4:3 &nbsp;For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you abstain from <em><strong>sexual immorality</strong></em>;<br />\n<br />\n1Cor. 6:13&nbsp; Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for <em><strong>immorality</strong></em>, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>We could go on with more examples, but as you can see the Bible makes clear that the believer is to abstain from any and all forms of sexual immorality, from which we get the word pornography.</p>\n\n<p>More specifically, watching pornography involves at least three forms of sin:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Licentiousness</strong> - The sexual acts on display in pornographic material are acts of fornication, which is the sin of sexual contact outside marriage. When we take part in this enterprise as an observer (<em>i.e</em>., as a customer of pornography), we are condoning and promoting fornication. This promoting behavior is itself the sin of licentiousness, or giving license to sin.</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 12:21 &nbsp;I am afraid that when I come again, my God may humiliate me before you, and I will grieve for many of those who previously sinned and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and licentiousness that they have practiced.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><strong>2. Lust</strong> - Pornographic materials are intended to illicit sexual arousal in our flesh, which is lust.&nbsp; Lust is any arousal of the flesh which occurs in an immoral manner, and the whole purpose of filming other people engaging in sexual acts (often grossly distorted and perverted acts) is to entice lust in the hearts of the audience.</p>\n\n<p>Lust is a sin, and anything that brings us to the point of lust is a sinfully corrupting and tempting influence. Jesus says that the commission of lust is equal to the commission of adultery. Consider the Bible&#39;s teaching:</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 5:28 but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman&nbsp; with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5>James 1:14 But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.<br />\nJames 1:15 Then&nbsp; when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when&nbsp; sin&nbsp; is accomplished, it brings forth death.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><strong>3. Sensuality</strong> - Watching pornography involves taking pleasure in observing strangers in a state of nakedness, which is the sin of sensuality or lewdness according to Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Glorying in another person&#39;s nakedness is sinful behavior, according to Scripture. Beginning in the Garden of Eden and continuing throughout the Bible, we find those who take pleasure in another&#39;s nakedness (outside of marriage) are depicted as shameful and due condemnation.&nbsp;For example, when one of Noah&#39;s sons took pleasure in seeing his father lying naked in his tent in Genesis 9, the Bible portrays the son&#39;s act as shameful and dishonoring.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, the Lord sees such conduct as reprehensible. Consider the Lord&#39;s admonishment against Israel when they engaged in lewd and immoral conduct:</p>\n\n<h5>Hab. 2:15&nbsp; &ldquo;Woe to you who make your neighbors drink,<br />\nWho mix in your venom even to make them drunk<br />\nSo as to look on their nakedness!<br />\n<br />\nHab. 2:16 &ldquo;You will be filled with disgrace rather than honor.<br />\nNow you yourself&nbsp; drink and&nbsp; expose your own nakedness.<br />\nThe&nbsp; cup in the LORD&rsquo;S right hand will come around to you,<br />\nAnd&nbsp; utter disgrace will come upon your glory.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>In summary, the act of watching pornography is immoral and sinful. It is wrong because it condones fornication and is licentiousness. It is intended to induce lust in the heart, and it exposes us to the nakedness of strangers.</p>\n\n<p>For practical advice on ending an addition to pornography, please read <a href=\"/bible-answers/how_should_a_christian_approach_their_addiction_to_pornography\">Solutions to a Pornography Addiction.</a></p>"

If someone does wrong to us but remains unrepentant and won&#39;t admit their sin, how do we show them forgiveness without encouraging them to continue sinning in the same way against us?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The Biblical expectation for forgiveness is that we forgive those who repent and seek our forgiveness:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLuke 17:3 &ldquo; Be on your guard!&nbsp; If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.<br />\n\tLuke 17:4 &ldquo;And if he sins against you&nbsp; seven times a day, and returns to you seven times, saying, &lsquo;I repent,&rsquo;&nbsp; forgive him.\"<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe Father in Heaven insists that we forgive all who seek our forgiveness, otherwise He will not show mercy to us in our sins:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 6:14 &ldquo; For if you forgive&nbsp; others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.<br />\n\tMatt. 6:15 &ldquo;But&nbsp; if you do not forgive&nbsp; others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tJesus says that if we are not inclined to forgive others when they ask us, then our Father in Heaven will not forgive us our transgressions. Jesus is not referring to the eternal forgiveness that comes to all believers at the point of faith in Christ. This forgiveness is not conditional. All believers in Jesus receive forgiveness of sins and will not suffer the Second Death reserved for unbelievers.</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead, Jesus is speaking about the Father&#39;s willingness to forgoing bringing earthly consequences upon us for the sins we commit in our life as believers. If we are so hard-hearted that we never forgive others who request our forgiveness, then when we sin on earth, the Father in Heaven will bring the consequences of our sin upon our heads to discipline us and make a point. Our incentive to be forgiving to those who ask is to remember that the Father forgave us when we asked.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat do we do for the believer who doesn&#39;t ask for forgiveness? The Biblical definition of forgiveness is a grant of mercy to the one who seeks it, so the process of forgiveness begins with the person who has committed the transgression asking for forgiveness. If that request is never made, then the offended person has no way to communicate forgiveness. You may choose to love the trangressor in spite of his sin and hold no grudge against him in your heart (which is a good and proper thing to do), but technically speaking, you cannot forgive him until he opens the door for the opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf a believer is unaware of his own sin or unwilling to admit his sin or blames others for his mistakes, then he is not seeking forgiveness and you are not able to offer it. You can&#39;t extend forgiveness to a person who doesn&#39;t seek it, but this doesn&#39;t mean you should hold a grudge or treat him with contempt. Instead, show him grace and love him despite his wrong thinking, and gently work to show him his error, preferably by teaching him from the Bible.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome personalities are prone to defensiveness and a poor ability to see themselves honestly, which makes working with them difficult under these circumstances. Nevertheless, the Lord is your hope to open their eyes. When this happens, they will ask for your forgiveness, and you shall grant it.</p>"

What did the fig tree say to Jesus that caused Jesus to answer the tree in the way He did?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The BIble you are referencing is the King James Version of the Bible, which reads:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMark 11:13 &nbsp;And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.<br />\n\tMark 11:14 &nbsp;And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, the King James Version translates the original Greek of Mark 11:14 incorrectly. In the original Greek, Mark 11:14 opens with the Greek word <em>apokrinomai</em>, which means \"to conclude for oneself\" or \"to respond.\"&nbsp; The word <em>apokrinomai</em> can mean \"a response to a question,\" but it can also describe a response to a nonverbal cue like something seen or experienced.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe King James Bible translates&nbsp;<em>apokrinomai</em> in Mark 11:14 to mean Jesus replied to a verbal cue (hence, \"Jesus answered\"), but Jesus was not replying to a question from the tree. By the context of the passage, we know Jesus was responding to what He saw when He looked at the tree, not to something Jesus heard. Therefore, the correct translation of Mark 11:14 should be \"Jesus responded...\"</p>\n<p>\n\tInterestingly, the New King James version corrects this error:</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom the NKJV:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMark 11:13 And seeing from afar a fig tree having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.<br />\n\tMark 11:14 In response Jesus said to it, &ldquo;Let no one eat fruit from you ever again.&rdquo;&nbsp; And His disciples heard it.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tSo, the fig tree in Mark 11 never spoke to Jesus, and neither was Jesus answering the tree when He spoke in v.14.&nbsp; Instead, Jesus saw that the tree had leaves but no fruit, and so He responded to what He saw in v.14.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo learn why Jesus caused the tree to wither, please read <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/why_did_jesus_cause_the_fig_tree_to_wither/\"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</p>"

Is this true?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Unfortunately, we are not experts in Puritan writing, but this is just as well, since Christians are not to search for the truth of our faith in the writings of other men, even other Christian men. Rather, we find such truth in the pages of scripture alone.</p>\n\n<p>On the authority scripture, we can assure you that salvation is not obtained by human works nor do human works \"keep\" or ensure our salvation. Paul himself rebuked the Galatian church for thinking they could maintain their salvation or become \"perfected\" by their works:</p>\n\n<h5>Gal. 3:1&nbsp; You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?<br />\nGal. 3:2 This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of&nbsp; the Law, or by hearing with faith?<br />\nGal. 3:3 Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul calls the Galatians \"foolish\" for believing that their flesh (i.e., their works) could contribute anything to a salvation that is by grace alone.</p>\n\n<p>Those who believe a Christian can \"lose\" salvation do not understand the nature of salvation itself. When a man is saved by God&#39;s grace, he is given the gift of faith, according to Eph 2:8.</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;<br />\nEph. 2:9&nbsp; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.</h5>\n\n<h5>&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>God delivers faith to the heart and prompts our confession of faith by means of His Spirit,&nbsp; Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>Gal. 4:6 Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>Rom. 8:15 For you&nbsp; have not received a spirit of slavery&nbsp; leading to fear again, but you have received&nbsp; a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, &ldquo;Abba! Father!&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Once the Spirit of God enters a man, He changes the man&#39;s nature forever, making him alive with the indwelling of God&#39;s spirit:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:1&nbsp; And you were dead&nbsp; in your trespasses and sins,<br />\nEph. 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to&nbsp; the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.<br />\nEph. 2:3 Among them we too all formerly lived in&nbsp; the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.<br />\nEph. 2:4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,<br />\nEph. 2:5 even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ ( by grace you have been saved),<br />\nEph. 2:6 and&nbsp; raised us up with Him, and&nbsp; seated us with Him in the heavenly places in&nbsp; Christ Jesus,<br />\nEph. 2:7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul says this new spirit within us is a permanent part of our being, as a pledge from God that He will complete the work He has begun:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 1:21 &nbsp;Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,<br />\n2Cor. 1:22 &nbsp;who also sealed us and&nbsp; gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a&nbsp; pledge.</h5>\n\n<h5>Phil. 1:6 &nbsp;For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, a person&#39;s nature is changed into something entirely different by the working of the Spirit, and that change can never be reversed. As Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 5:14 For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died;<br />\n2Cor. 5:15 and He died for all, so that they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf.<br />\n2Cor. 5:16&nbsp; Therefore from now on we recognize no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ&nbsp; according to the flesh, yet now we know Him in this way no longer.<br />\n2Cor. 5:17 Therefore if anyone is in Christ,&nbsp; he is a new creature;&nbsp; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice Paul says the Lord \"controls\" us and we are no longer recognized (or are known) as someone in the flesh. We are a new creature, like that butterfly that emerges from the cocoon, we can never return to our old nature.</p>\n\n<p>Our salvation is a supernatural, spiritual change, not something obtained nor maintained by the thoughts in our head nor by the works of the flesh, but by the power of God.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. In 1 Timothy 2 Paul tells Timothy that the Lord wishes all people to be saved. Doesn&#39;t this statement contradict the idea of election and predestination, which teaches that God has chosen some people for salvation while not choosing others?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The opening verses of 1Timothy 2 are often cited as evidence against the doctrine of predestination and election. The verse most commonly quoted is 1Tim 2:4, but we will include a longer passage to provide context:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Tim. 2:1 &nbsp;First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men,<br />\n\t1Tim. 2:2&nbsp; for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.<br />\n\t1Tim. 2:3 &nbsp;This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,<br />\n\t1Tim. 2:4&nbsp; who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.<br />\n\t1Tim. 2:5 &nbsp;For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,<br />\n\t1Tim. 2:6 &nbsp;who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe key to interpreting this passage properly (and all scripture, for that matter) is understanding its meaning in the context where it is found. In this case, the context clearly indicates that Paul had a different topic in mind than the one often attributed to this passage.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, notice that Paul begins in v.2 by telling Timothy that the church should pray on behalf of \"all men.\" Then in the next verse, Paul defines what he means by \"all men.\" In v.2 Paul defines \"all men\" as \"kings and all who are in authority.\" So by the context, we see Paul didn&#39;t say \"all men\" to mean all human beings. Rather, Paul referred to \"all men\" as in all types of people, whether poor or powerful.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul wanted the church to pray for the benefit of all kinds of men. Paul knew that Timothy would instruct the church to pray for the persecuted saints, but Paul also wanted the church to pray for those who were persecuting the church, including kings and all men in authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn v.2 Paul explains why he wanted the church to pray in this way. If the church prays for men in authority, it will lead to a more tranquil and quiet life for the saints. In v.4 Paul reminds the church that even these powerful men were not outside the Lord&#39;s reach, because the Lord will bring salvation even to powerful men who persecute the church when it suits His purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is great irony in this passage coming from Paul. Timothy and the entire church remembered that Paul hiumself was once a powerful man who persecuted the church. So when Paul tells the church to pray for powerful men who persecute them, he is speaking from experience, and his request would have carried additional credibility with the church for this reason.</p>\n<p>\n\tClearly, Paul was not teaching Timothy that God was prepared to bring salvation to all human beings, as your question suggested. First, if the sovereign God of the Universe wishes to save all men, He will most certainly do so, since nothing can frustrate the will of God. Yet&nbsp;we can clearly see that not \"all men\" are coming to faith, so are we to conclude that God has \"wishes\" that are not coming true? This is a false vew of God, one that is contrary to scripture and made possible by a wrong interpretation of 1Tim 2.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the context of 1Tim 2, the Lord \"wishes\" to bring salvation to His elect, regardless of their station in life. While scripture teaches the elect will be called primarily from among the poor and weak of the world (1Corinthians 1), this passage teaches us that the elect are not exclusively found among the poor. Rather, the Lord may occasionally bring faith to a powerful man in authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, we can see why Paul would ask the church to pray for the salvation of authority figures, since the salvation of a king might become a means to end persecution over the church (as happened with Paul). This is the sense of Paul&#39;s words in 1Tim 2 when he says the Lord wishes to bring \"all men\" to salvation.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, when we leave Paul&#39;s words in their proper context, we are led to a proper interpretation and avoid mistaken interpretations that create apparent contraditions with other Biblical doctrines (like election).</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are interested in learning more on this topic, we encourage you to read the following additional articles:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/does_peter_teach_that_god_is_waiting_for_everyone_to_believe/\">Does Peter teach that God is waiting for all men to believe?</a></strong><br />\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/wrestling_with_god/\">Wrestling With God</a></strong></p>"

We can see this clearly by looking at the entire context of the verse:</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 4:1 &nbsp;But&nbsp; the Spirit explicitly says that&nbsp; in later times some will&nbsp; fall away from the faith, paying attention to&nbsp; deceitful spirits and&nbsp; doctrines of demons,<br />\n1Tim. 4:2 by means of the hypocrisy of liars&nbsp; seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron,<br />\n1Tim. 4:3 men who&nbsp; forbid marriage and advocate&nbsp; abstaining from foods which&nbsp; God has created to be&nbsp; gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth.<br />\n1Tim. 4:4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is&nbsp; received with gratitude;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Clearly, Paul&#39;s intent was not to endorse the use of illegal drugs. In fact, Paul himself teaches elsewhere that illegal activity of any kind&nbsp;is a sin, both for believers and unbelievers. The Bible makes this clear in numerous places.</p>\n\n<p>First, Paul tells us in Romans 13:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 13:1&nbsp; Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except&nbsp; from God, and those which exist are established by God.<br />\nRom. 13:2 Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>All governmental authority extends from God, and when we resist the laws of our land, we resist God (i.e., we sin). The government has outlawed the use of certain drugs, including marijuana. Therefore, when a Christian uses these drugs, they commit a crime, and the Bible teaches that violating the law is a sin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Peter teaches the same thing when he says:</p>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 2:12&nbsp; Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they&nbsp; slander you as evildoers, they may&nbsp; because of your good deeds, as they observe them,&nbsp; glorify God&nbsp; in the day of&nbsp; visitation.<br />\n1Pet. 2:13&nbsp; Submit yourselves for the Lord&rsquo;s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority,<br />\n1Pet. 2:14 or to governors as sent&nbsp; by him&nbsp; for the punishment of evildoers and the&nbsp; praise of those who do right.<br />\n1Pet. 2:15 For such is the will of God that by doing right you may&nbsp; silence the ignorance of foolish men.<br />\n1Pet. 2:16 Act as&nbsp; free men, and&nbsp; do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as&nbsp; bondslaves of God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Your testimony as a Christian is compromised when you violated the law, including the drug laws.&nbsp; You are shaming the name of Christ.&nbsp; We are expected to do what is right before men so that by our excellent, law-abiding behavior the name of Christ is glorified.</p>\n\n<p>Again, Paul teaches:</p>\n\n<h5>Titus 3:1&nbsp; Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>More recently, some states have begun to legalize the use of certain drugs, including marijuana. Christians living in these states have liberty to partake of legal substances, according to the leading of the Spirit. Even as you may do so, consider whether such behavior is constructive to your witness and your walk with Christ.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Bible teaches we are not to give our bodies over to the influence of any substance, but instead we are to allow the Holy Spirit to remain in control of our bodies:</span></p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 5:18 &nbsp;And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Paul says we are not to be drunk with wine since this is a dissipation. Dissipation is the needless wasting of energy and opportunity. Instead, the Church is to be under the influence and direction of the Spirit, so we can remain productive for Christ. Paul uses the example of wine since alcohol was the common \"drug\" of his day.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of alcohol, it is possible to drink &nbsp;in moderation without losing control of one&#39;s senses, so it is not necessary to abstain from alcohol entirely to obey Paul&#39;s command in Ephesians 5:18.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">On the other hand, many drugs (including marijuana) are mind-altering even in small doses. In fact, the primary attraction of these substances is in their ability to bring altered states of consciousness, which is a direct violation of Paul&#39;s command to rely on the Spirit and nothing else.</span></p>\n\n<p>Therefore, though the use of marijuana or other drugs may one day become legal in your area, the question remains does your use of these things violate scripture? While the Bible may give us liberty to use legal substances, we must apply a higher standard in making our decision. As Paul taught:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 10:23 &nbsp;&nbsp;All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful, but not all things edify.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Therefore, we strongly encourage all Christians to resist the urge to use illegal and even legal use of mind-altering drugs, and instead seek for a closer walk with Christ in obedience and self-sacrifice.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Is the Mormon faith another form of Christianity? They teach they are the only truth, but how is that different from what you claim?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA. Though Mormons are often very upright, conscientious&nbsp;and decent&nbsp;people (and though they&nbsp;portray themselves as Christians),&nbsp;nevertheless they are <strong><em>not</em></strong> Christian according to the word of God. The Mormon faith is a false religion preaching a false gospel that cannot save men.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mormons claim they are the only true Christian&nbsp;faith, having rediscovered the true Gospel previously lost.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Groups that lay claim to \"rediscovered\" truth to the exclusion of all else are&nbsp;displaying cult-like tendencies (i.e., a desire to control the message for the faithful while limiting access to outside information to the contrary).</span></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/mormon-temple.jpg\" style=\"width: 345px; height: 315px; float: right; margin: 15px;\" /></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Mormons follow this cult pattern in the way they teach their followers&nbsp;a false and distorted view of Christ and Christianity, which they maintain was rediscovered&nbsp;millennia after being \"lost.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Mean</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">while, the Bible says </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">the true gospel was delivered \"once for all\" to the saints (Jude 3), and no new revelation will be given (Heb 1:1-3).&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the Mormons&nbsp;claim they obtained a new and better view of the Gospel through Joseph Smith, and in&nbsp;the tradition of cult thinking, they instill an \"us against the world\" mentality in their followers, which&nbsp;achieves its effect by innoculating their members to&nbsp;the real Gospel.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to the Mormon cult, the&nbsp;true Christian faith never claims to have exclusive ownership of the Gospel. True Christians certainly profess&nbsp;belief in an&nbsp;<em>exclusive</em> truth, that is the truth&nbsp;of the Gospel found in the Bible, but&nbsp;Christians do not claim an exclusive <em>ownership</em> of this truth. Rather, we acknowledge God&#39;s truth is controlled by&nbsp;the Spirit and will never be lost according by the power of Christ to preserve His Church. No&nbsp;one group \"owns\" &ndash;&nbsp;much less restores &ndash; that truth.</p>\n\n<p>Genuine Christianity&nbsp;acknowledges that anyone who professes&nbsp;faith in Christ will be saved. The true believer need not belong to a particular group or denomination, for these earthly associations do not define truth nor salvation. Truth is a Person. and the message and power of Jesus is available to anyone through the word of God&nbsp;and always has been since Jesus delivered it (see Rom 10:16)</p>\n\n<p>Mormons, on the other hand,&nbsp;have created their own \"gospel\" (which is no gospel at all), and claim that all others are apostate.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Mormon gospel&nbsp;grossly distorts the truth., claiming that&nbsp;Jesus was merely a man who became a god through good works. They also maintain&nbsp;that&nbsp;all good Mormons&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">can become gods (as Jesus did) through righteous works. Obviously, this is utterly false.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">If this story sounds familiar, it should, because this is a repetition of the same lie Satan told Eve in the garden (see Genesis 3:5). No wonder&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Mormons teach that salvation is only found through the Mormon church, because this lie is a scheme of the enemy to entrap humanity in a false gospel that cannot save.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">By contrast,&nbsp;the Bible says that salvation&nbsp;comes by faith alone in Christ alone (see Eph 2:8-9), and therefore a&nbsp;t</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">rue</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Christian&nbsp;is defined by scripture&nbsp;as&nbsp;one who trusts in Christ alone (see&nbsp;Romans 10:16). This&nbsp;definition&nbsp;was given long before Jospeh Smith and&nbsp;the Mormons</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;came along, therefore</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;we must reject any attempt on their&nbsp;part to redefine salvation in another way.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In the end, the Mormon religion is no different than any other man-made, false religion: it&nbsp;seeks to diminish&nbsp;the diety of Christ while elevating man to equality with God. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In this teaching, we can clearly see Satan&#39;s</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;fingerprints. Tthe&nbsp;Mormon church orginated from the visions of a&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">convicted</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;conman, Joseph Smith.&nbsp;In the early 1800s Smith&nbsp;claimed to have received the \"restored faith\" from an angel of light\\. This testimony&nbsp;reminds us of&nbsp;2Cor 11:14, where Paul&nbsp;warns believers that&nbsp;Satan oftem&nbsp;comes disguised&nbsp;as an angel of light to deceive the unbeliever. This is Smith&#39;s own testimony.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Simply put, Mormonism was delivered to an unbeliever by Satan, appearing as an angel of light, with the purpose&nbsp;to corrupt the minds of unbelievers.

Doesn&#39;t this apply to Christians?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. In Isaiah 65:4 the Lord, speaking through Isaiah, is addressing the nation of Israel. He declares that Israel has&nbsp;a long history of disobeying His commandments. Let&#39;s look at the passage in its proper context:</p>\n\n<h6>Is. 65:1 &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask for Me;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I permitted Myself to be found by those who did not seek Me.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I said, &lsquo;Here am I, here am I,&rsquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">To a nation which did not call on My name.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<h6>Is. 65:2 &nbsp; &ldquo;I have spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Who walk in the way which is not good, following their own thoughts,&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<h6>Is. 65:3 &nbsp; &nbsp; A people who continually&nbsp; provoke Me to My face,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on bricks;&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<h6>Is. 65:4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sit among graves and spend the night in secret places;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Who eat swine&rsquo;s flesh,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And the broth of unclean meat is in their pots.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<h6>Is. 65:5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Who say, &lsquo;Keep to yourself, do not come near me,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For I am holier than you!&rsquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">These are smoke in My nostrils,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">A fire that burns all the day.&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<h6>Is. 65:6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Behold, it is written before Me,&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I will&nbsp; not keep silent, but I will repay;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">I will even repay into their bosom,&nbsp;</span></h6>\n\n<h6>Is. 65:7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Both their own iniquities and the iniquities of their fathers together,&rdquo; says the LORD.<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&ldquo;Because they have&nbsp; burned incense on the mountains</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">And scorned Me on the hills,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In this passage, the Lord cites numerous examples of how Israel has disobeyed the instructions given to them in the covenant of Law, including Israel&#39;s disobedience in eating pork. The people of Israel were commanded in their law to never eat pork, but the nation disobeyed the Lord nonetheless. Because of their disobedience under the Law, the Lord promises to prevent them from receiving their Messiah for a time, while the Gospel goes to the Gentiles.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Old Covenant was only binding on Israel. It was intended to set Israel apart from the Gentile world, and it eventually gave the Lord just cause to withhold the Kingdom from Israel while offering salvation to the Gentiles. The Lord&nbsp;was speaking to Israel in 65:4, so His admonishment was directed to Jews alone, who were willingly violating the Old Covenant law.</span></p>\n\n<p>Today, Christian believers in Jesus Christ are saved by the grace found in the New Covenant, and as Paul taught, we are not bound by the regulations of the Law found in the Old Covenant:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 6:14 For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Rom. 7:4&nbsp; Therefore, my brethren, you also were&nbsp; made to die&nbsp; to the Law&nbsp; through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Rom. 7:6 But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in&nbsp; newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<h6>Col. 2:16 Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day &mdash;<br />\nCol. 2:17 things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Therefore, any Gentile&nbsp;and all Christians are free to consume pork or anything God has made, since the regulations of the Law do not apply to those who are not bound by that covenant. Only unbelieving Israel is bound by that covenant today.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, there is nothing inherently sinful about pork or any food. The Lord&#39;s displeasure at Israel for eating pork had nothing to do with pork itself.&nbsp;Just as the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil&nbsp;in the Garden was not inherently sinful, neither is pork inherently sinful. In both cases, the problem wasn&#39;t the food itself, for as the Paul says:</span></p>\n\n<h6>1Tim. 4:4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1Tim. 4:5 for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Rather, the problem in both cases was disobedience to God&#39;s word. Adam received an instruction from God, which he disobeyed resulting in God&#39;s judgment against him. Likewise,&nbsp;Israel received a word to abstain from pork in the covenant, yet they disobeyed,&nbsp;provoking His anger against them.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For more information on this issue, we invite you to read the following articles on the believer&#39;s relationship to the Law of Moses.</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/on_law_and_liberty_part_1/\"><strong>On Law and Liberty</strong></a></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/do_we_need_the_old_testament_law/\">Old Testament Law</a></strong></p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. Pastor Armstrong taught that God hardened the hearts of Israel and turned their ears away so that they would not believe in Christ. Does that mean that God purposely prevented those people from believing in the Gospel?&nbsp;</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">A. The Bible teaches that the nation of Israel was &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; at Christ&#39;s appearing,&nbsp;which means God did not permit them to recognize their Messiah during His first coming. The Lord did this justly, because the Old Covenant required that Israel receive this penalty for their sin under the Law. (Please consult our <a href=\"/bible-studies/revelation_2011\">Revelation</a> study for more background on how the Old Covenant gave cause for&nbsp;Israel&#39;s hardening.)&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">We see the hardened of Israel&nbsp;mentioned clearly in Romans, beginning in chapter 10:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 10:16&nbsp; However, they&nbsp;did not all heed the&nbsp;good news; for Isaiah says, &ldquo;LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\nRom. 10:17&nbsp; So faith comes from&nbsp;hearing, and hearing by&nbsp;the word&nbsp;of Christ.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 10:18&nbsp;&nbsp;But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE&nbsp;&nbsp;WORLD.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 10:19&nbsp; But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;I WILL&nbsp;MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 10:20&nbsp; And Isaiah is very bold and says,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 10:21&nbsp;But as for Israel He says, &ldquo;ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE.&rdquo;&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Paul says that not all Israel heeded the good news, just as Isaiah lamented in fortelling how no one in Israel&nbsp;would believe the report of the Messiah&rsquo;s arrival. Faith comes by hearing, but the ability to hear (and believe) comes by the word of Christ. The Lord said through Isaiah that no one in Israel would believe the Gospel when Christ came the first time.</span></p>\n\n<p>Paul knew we&nbsp;might try to \"explain away\" the fact of Israel&#39;s hardening. Perhaps we would&nbsp;assume that Israel&rsquo;s failure to believe was merely because they didn&rsquo;t hear the Gospel, but Paul disabuses us of that notion in v.18. Paul says the nation did, in fact, hear the Gospel as the word of God promised they would.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Still not willing to accept the truth of God&#39;s choice to harden Israel, perhaps we will say that Israel&rsquo;s failure to believe was because the nation didn&rsquo;t know Jesus was the Messiah, but in v.19 Paul counters that objection as well. Paul quotes from Deuteronomy,&nbsp;where Moses promised Israel that in a&nbsp;future day God would prevent them from receiving their Messiah because of their sins under the covenant. Instead, the Lord would permit Himself to be \"found\" by&nbsp;the Gentile nations instead, as a testimony against Israel of what they lost.</span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, Paul tells us that Isaiah foretold boldly how only&nbsp;the Gentiles would find the Messiah, because Israel remained disobedient and obstinate. Based on Paul&#39;s teaching in&nbsp;Romans 10, our conclusion is unavoidable: Israel was hardened and prevented from&nbsp;receiving their Messiah so that the Gentiles could have opportunity to be saved.</p>\n\n<p>Pauls reinforces this truth in chapter 11, when he teaches:</p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rom. 11:7&nbsp; What then? What&nbsp;Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but&nbsp;&nbsp;those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were&nbsp;&nbsp;hardened;&nbsp;</span><br />\nRom. 11:8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;just as it is written,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 11:9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And David says,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 11:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT,&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 11:11&nbsp;&nbsp;I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they?&nbsp;&nbsp;May it never be! But by their transgression&nbsp;&nbsp;salvation has come to the Gentiles, to&nbsp;make them jealous.&nbsp;<br />\nRom. 11:12&nbsp;Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their&nbsp;fulfillment be!</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">According to Paul, the Lord chose a remnant of&nbsp;Israel to believe the Gospel, because He has&nbsp;promised He&nbsp;will always maintain a believing remnant within Israel, but the \"rest of Israel\"&nbsp;were hardened by God.&nbsp;Nevertheless,&nbsp;God&rsquo;s decision to harden the majority of Israel was not intended to destroy Israel. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In v.10 Paul quotes the Psalms where David declared that God would be just to darken Israel&#39;s eyes forever and bend their backs forever (i.e., to prevent them from receiving the Messiah forever) because of their unbelief and disobedience under the covenant, but&nbsp;God will not reject His people forever.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Paul says in v.11 that their hardening was intended to bless Gentiles for a time, but eventually the Lord will return to Israel and bring the nation into&nbsp;faith so they may receive the glory He promised.</span></p>\n\n<p>If you are struggling to understand the Bible&#39;s teaching concerning the sovereignty of God&nbsp;in these matters, we encourage you to read the&nbsp;article&nbsp;<a href=\"/devotionals/wrestling_with_god\">Wrestling With God</a>&nbsp;on our website, which examines this issue in considerable detail.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. In Genesis it says that the lights, in the sky are for signs and seasons, and for days and years. I now the Bible speaks strongly against Astrology, but how is it that the stars are for signs, but Astrology is wrong?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. In Genesis we read:</p>\n\n<h5>Gen. 1:14&nbsp; Then God said, &ldquo;Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The Lord says the heavens were created for signs, seasons and &nbsp;counting time. Obviously, we can understand how the heavens create our seasons on earth, but the other two uses (signs and counting time) leave open the possibility for some confusion. Let&#39;s consider what the Lord meant.</p>\n\n<p>First, the sun and moon were given so we could count time. Obviously, our process of counting time has always involved counting revolutions around the sun, rotations of the earth and revolutions of the moon. It&#39;s important to note that the process of counting time is one of tracking the passage of time, not predicting future events. Clearly, mankind uses the heavens as God intended when we count the passage of time.</p>\n\n<p>Why did God want us to count time? Remember, God Himself lives outside of time, so He doesn&#39;t count time for His sake. He gave man the ability to mark the passage of time for our needs. The answer is God wanted man to track progress toward the fulfillment of His promises concerning the end of the age. Because man could count time, Israel could anticipate God&#39;s fulfillment to bring the Messiah (from Daniel 9). Because man can count time, we can know the length of Tribulation (seven years), the length of the Kingdom (1,000 years), and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Until this present age ends, man will have reason to track the passage of time so we can verify the faithfulness of God in keeping His promises. Interestingly, after this age ends, the sun and moon will depart, presumably because the tracking of years will not be necessary in the New Heavens and Earth (as described in Revelation 21 &amp; 22).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, these heavenly objects are for signs. The word \"sign\" in Scripture means omen or a warning that something promised is about to occur. God has promised in His word that certain events must take place in the future on earth, particularly events related to His Son&#39;s first and second coming to earth. God intends to use the sun, moon, and stars as signs in the sky to warn the world of the approach of these events.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, these heavenly bodies do not by themselves predict future events - the Bible itself has already given us prophecy concerning these events - the heavens simply alert us when the promised event begin to occur.</p>\n\n<p>Contrast these purposes with astrology. Astrology is a demonic-inspired means of predicting future events by the movement of the sun, moon, planets, and stars. This is divination and is evil and forbidden in Scripture:</p>\n\n<h5>Deut. 18:10 &ldquo;There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices witchcraft, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer,<br />\nDeut. 18:11 or one who casts a spell, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead.</h5>\n\n<h5>1Sam. 15:23&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For rebellion is as the sin of divination,<br />\nAnd insubordination is as iniquity and idolatry.<br />\nBecause you have rejected the word of the Lord,<br />\nHe has also rejected you from being king.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<h5>Ezek. 13:9 &ldquo;So My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will have no place in the council of My people, nor will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel, that you may know that I am the Lord God.</h5>\n\n<p>Satan is the one supplying the insight to those practicing astrology (or any other occultic practice of divination), and the only future he can predict are his future actions. Satan can tell us what he might do in the future, but he can&#39;t tell us what God will do in the future.&nbsp;Satan is limited to supplying us prophetic information about his actions and nothing more.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the predictions of astrology and other dark arts are often inaccurate. Even when astrological predictions are accurate, it is only when Satan has revealed future demonic activities. The Spirit of God will never participate in any effort by us to learn about the future outside what&#39;s already provided in God&#39;s word, so when we consult astrology, we are consulting Satan alone. We are tapping into the enemy&#39;s knowledge and seeking truth from him rather than from God&#39;s word, repeating the sin of Adam in the Garden.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, any \"prophecy\" or \"telling\" obtained through astrology or other means of divination will be at best inaccurate and worthless, or at worst it will be demonic-sourced information about the future activities of Satan. In either case, such predictions say nothing about God&#39;s purposes or plans, and seeking after them is a dangerous and ungodly practice.</p>\n\n<p>While we may watch the heavens for signs and omens confirming God&#39;s word (e.g., the sun turning black and the moon turning to blood and the stars falling from the heavens as described in Revelation 6:12), we should not turn to them for any other source of information.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I know you teach that we can&#39;t \"claim\" a Bible verse for ourselves, but what about passages like Jeremiah 29:11 or Isaiah 43 that make promises consistent with teaching in the New Testament, like Romans 8:28? Can we look upon these verses and claim them as true for us today? Isn&#39;t the Gentile Church grafted into the promises of Israel anyway?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. As we mentioned in an <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/claiming_promises_in_the_bible/\">earlier article</a></strong>, it is never proper to interpret Scripture by \"claiming\" a verse is written to us personally. The notion of claiming a verse stems from the idea that the Bible is merely a collection of sayings or words of wisdom, and that these words have magical power to compel God according to our hopes or desires. Like incantations, the words themselves are believed to hold the power, and if we appropriate them for ourselves, the power to make them true will come as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo help illustrate how this is false, consider an everyday example. Let&#39;s assume a wife mailed her husband a Valentine&#39;s Day card with the words, \"I love you.\" Unfortunately, the card was delivered by mistake to the next door neighbor&#39;s house.&nbsp;When your neighbor opened the card and read it, he immediately recognized that the card was intended for someone else.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, the neighbor decides to \"claim\" the words for himself, so the next time he sees the wife standing in her front yard, he walks up to her and leans close expecting a big kiss.&nbsp; What do you think this woman would do in response?</p>\n<p>\n\tAs silly as this example may be, this is exactly what we do to God when we take His words out of context and attempt to misdirect them for our own purposes. God&#39;s word has power, of course, but the source of that power is found in God Himself. God will ensure that His word goes forth and does not fail, as Isaiah says:</p>\n<h5>\n\tIs. 55:11 &nbsp; So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;<br />\n\tIt will not return to Me empty,<br />\n\tWithout accomplishing what I desire,<br />\n\tAnd without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tNotice where true power lies: in God&#39;s determination to see His word accomplish \"WHAT I DESIRE.\" &nbsp;This is the key point. God&#39;s word will accomplish what God wants it to accomplish.&nbsp; It does not accomplish what we desire. It only accomplishes what God desires. This is the power of God&#39;s word.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, there is no basis for us to \"claim\" a verse of Scripture and expect it will have power in our life. For example, consider the following verse from Psalm 2:</p>\n<h5>\n\tPsa. 2:8 &lsquo;Ask of Me, and I will surely give the nations as Your inheritance,<br />\n\tAnd the very ends of the earth as Your possession.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tCan we \"claim\" this verse? Can I decide that God is promising to give me the nations as an inheritance and the very earth as my possession? No, because the psalmist wasn&#39;t talking about me. Psalm 2 is addressed to Jesus. The psalmist was describing what God the Father has promised to do for His Son, Jesus. Jesus will receive the nations as an inheritance and will possess the entire earth.This verse does not apply to us, and so we can&#39;t claim that it does.</p>\n<p>\n\tProper interpretation of Scripture requires that we make careful observation of who is speaking and who is being addressed by the text. Only then can we arrive at a proper interpretation and application.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe notion of claiming Scripture for ourselves also gives rise to silly, illogical and unhelpful interpretations of Scripture. For example, how would someone \"claim\" this verse:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Tim. 4:13 When you come bring the cloak which I left at&nbsp; Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tTurning to the verses you cited, let&#39;s look at Jeremiah 29:11 in context:</p>\n<h5>\n\tJer. 29:10&nbsp; &ldquo;For thus says the LORD, &lsquo;When seventy years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill My&nbsp; good word to you, to bring you back to this place.<br />\n\tJer. 29:11 &lsquo;For I know the&nbsp; plans that I&nbsp; have for you,&rsquo; declares the LORD, &lsquo;plans for&nbsp; welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a&nbsp; hope.<br />\n\tJer. 29:12 &lsquo;Then you will&nbsp; call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will&nbsp; listen to you.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the Lord is speaking to Israel in captivity in Babylon (as v.10 demonstrates clearly). To this group of exiled Jews, the Lord then says in v.11 that He has plans for them and His plans are not to bring Israel to its end. Rather, the Lord is working in Babylon for Israel&#39;s welfare and to give them a future hope. God is speaking words of encouragement through Jeremiah to Israel in captivity so Israel will not grow discouraged in their circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, in v.12 the Lord promises Israel that one day they will call upon the Lord&#39;s name and pray to Him and He will listen to them again. This prophecy is ultimately fulfilled in the days of Tribulation when Israel is restored at the Second Coming of Christ. &nbsp;(If you are interested in learning more about this restoration of Israel, we recommend you study our <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/\"><strong>Revelation</strong></a> course.)</p>\n<p>\n\tSo can we take the message of Jeremiah 29:11 personally? Remember, God is speaking concerning a specific audience with a specific purpose here, and we must understand and respect that audience and purpose. In the case of Jeremiah 29:11, God says He has good intentions for Israel in their captivity, and He will ultimately bring about Israel&#39;s restoration at the Lord&#39;s return.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tSince we are not Israel in captivity in Babylon, we cannot interpret these verse to say anything specifically about Gentile Christians today. Nevertheless, these verses still have value for Christians in the way they can teach us concerning Israel and help us gain an appreciation for God&#39;s plan for Israel (see 2Tim 3:16), but the context doesn&#39;t allow us to interpret the verse as if speaking about us personally.</p>\n<p>\n\tA better question to ask is can we find the principles of Jeremiah 29:11 (i.e., that the Lord has good intentions for Israel and Israel can rest in that hope) expressed to Gentile Christians elsewhere in the Bible?&nbsp; In this case, the answer is yes. Other Scripture repeats this principle and applies it to Christians.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou cited one example in Romans 8:28, but we can also see it in Romans 8:31, Rom 8:38-39, Phil 1:6, Phil 4:11-16, and many more. These verses teach and support the same concept but apply them specifically to Gentile Christians. Jeremiah 29:11, however, is not a proof text to support this conclusion for Gentiles.</p>\n<p>\n\tIsaiah 43 is another good example of this same principle. The words spoken in that chapter are directed at Israel only, so we cannot appropriate them for our own purposes assuming the Lord will automatically honor our desires. Nevertheless, many (but not all) of the principles in that chapter can be found repeated for Christians elsewhere in the Bible.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we get \"lazy\" and misappropriate Scripture and make false interpretations, we risk making very wrong conclusions and teaching others to expect wrong things.&nbsp; For example, consider 2Chr 7:14:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Chr. 7:14&nbsp; and My people&nbsp; who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin and will heal their land.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tI&#39;ve seen bumper stickers featuring this verse accented with patriotic American flags. The intended interpretation is obvious: if America would heed these instructions, God has promised to heal our land.&nbsp; This is simply wrong.&nbsp; The verse is speaking only to Israel, as part of the God&#39;s covenant with Israel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tNo where in Scripture does God promise to heal any other nation under any circumstances. God does not have a covenant with the United States. Only Israel receives such a promise, which will be fulfilled at Christ&#39;s Second Coming. Bumper sticker theology should not replace proper Biblical scholarship.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, yes we are grafted into the promises of Israel, but remember the full context of Paul&#39;s analogy in Romans 11. We are the unnatural branches grafted into the natural tree.&nbsp; The promises are given to the natural (Israel), and the unnatural branches will benefit from them as well, but the benefit is purely spiritual. Through the promises of Israel, we receive opportunity for salvation and to know the Lord and learn His word. On the other hand, we do not gain the right to have all that Israel was promised.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe promises to Israel stand apart from anything the Gentiles expect to receive. Consider the analogy of the wife of the President. When he enters office, he will receive many perks and privileges that go with his office.&nbsp; His wife will also enjoy many of those same perks, but she is not the President. She can&#39;t expect to be treated like the President and she doesn&#39;t have the same privileges. She simply benefits by association.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, the Church is blessed by its connection to Israel through our faith in the promises of God, but we are not Israel and never will be Israel. Therefore, we cannot look upon promises spoken directly to that nation and assume each detail is true for Christians or us personally, unless those principles are repeated to the church specifically in other Scripture.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Recently, my pastor began allowing women to preach from the pulpit. I believe Scripture teaches against this practice.&nbsp;What should I do? Should I leave the church?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. T<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">he Bible is abundantly clear about the role of women teaching in the church. <a href=\"/resource_library/questions_and_answers/can_a_woman_teach_men_in_the_church/\">Another article</a>&nbsp;on this website provide the&nbsp;full exposition of the related scriptures, but to summarize, scripture establishes&nbsp;that the church leadership must be men, and since teaching is inherently a position of leadership, Paul also&nbsp;prohibited women teaching men in the church.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Anytime a woman is permitted to lead or teach men in violation of clear scriptural requirements,</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;we display an uwillingness to follow Biblical authority. Such a perception is damaging to the church, because it suggests we may set aside the clear instructions of scripture whenever it suits us. Taken to its inevitable end, this attitude will lead to the church walking farther and farther away from the truth of God&#39;s word in into an acceptance of the enemy&#39;s lies.</span></p>\n\n<p>Regarding your situation, we cannot advise you whether to stay at your church or seek fellowship elsewhere, because such a decision is between you and the Holy Spirit. Remaining a part of a church where women preach and teach men is not a sin on your part, since you are not accountable for others&#39; decisions.&nbsp;On the other hand, remaining in a church that does not respect the commands of scripture may eventually cause you greater concerns.</p>\n\n<p>The Lord will lead you as He desires, and in the meantime, if<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;you choose to confront your pastor, we recommend you take the following steps. First, ask your husband to take the lead in pursuing this issue with the church leadership. Ironically, you risk violating the very principle you advocate (</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">i.e</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">., male headship in the church) if you take the lead in challenging&nbsp;your pastor&#39;s decisions. Instead, your husband should provide spiritual cover for you by leading in the challenge.</span></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, conversations with the pastor should focus on his interpretation of specific Scripture.

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I am a Christian woman married to a man for 26 years who I do not love. &nbsp;I am ashamed to admit it, but I can&#39;t make myself love him. I cannot be physically intimate, which frustrates him of course. I want to obey God and serve Him, but how can I do that when I am pretending to love my husband. I feel guilty ministering to others in my situation. I know love is more than a feeling, but how do I sort this out?<br />\n\t&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tA. Your situation is one that other married Christian women also face, though few confide in others for fear of being judged. Know you are not alone in this struggle.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo begin, let&#39;s look at the scriptures that relate to the relationship of a wife to her husband:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 5:15&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp; be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise,<br />\n\tEph. 5:16&nbsp;&nbsp; making the most of your time, because the days are evil.<br />\n\tEph. 5:17 So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.<br />\n\tEph. 5:18 And&nbsp; do not get drunk with wine,&nbsp; for that is&nbsp; dissipation, but be&nbsp; filled with the Spirit,<br />\n\tEph. 5:19&nbsp; speaking to&nbsp; one another in&nbsp; psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;<br />\n\tEph. 5:20&nbsp; always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to&nbsp;&nbsp; God, even the Father;<br />\n\tEph. 5:21&nbsp;&nbsp; and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.<br />\n\tEph. 5:22&nbsp; Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.<br />\n\tEph. 5:23 For&nbsp; the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the&nbsp; head of the church, He Himself&nbsp; being the Savior of the body.<br />\n\tEph. 5:24 But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.<br />\n\tEph. 5:25&nbsp; Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her;<br />\n\tEph. 5:26&nbsp; that He might sanctify her, having&nbsp; cleansed her by the&nbsp; washing of water with&nbsp; the word,<br />\n\tEph. 5:27 that He might&nbsp; present to Himself the church&nbsp; in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she should be&nbsp; holy and blameless.<br />\n\tEph. 5:28 So husbands ought also to&nbsp; love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;<br />\n\tEph. 5:29 for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,<br />\n\tEph. 5:30 because we are members of His&nbsp; body.<br />\n\tEph. 5:31&nbsp; FOR THIS CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND SHALL CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE; AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.<br />\n\tEph. 5:32 This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.<br />\n\tEph. 5:33 Nevertheless let each individual among you also&nbsp; love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see to it that she&nbsp;&nbsp; respect her husband.</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul gives guidelines to the church on how to behave knowing the days are evil. The church needs to follow what is right, and Paul outlines for the church the specific behaviors to adopt in their relationships to ensure they are doing what is right.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn verse 21 Paul says that Christians should be subject to one another. This means giving regard for one another, and not putting our own needs above another&#39;s. Simply put, we are to love others more than we love ourselves. Then Paul moves to discussing the most intimate earthly relationship we can experience: marriage.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn verse 21 he speaks specifically to the wife. Paul says the wife is to be subject to her own husband. Paul adds \"&hellip;as we are to the Lord.\" To give an example of the marriage relationship, Paul draws a comparison to the Church&#39;s relationship to Christ. A wife is not commanded to love her husband; she is commanded to be subject to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tWives are to follow the husbands direction in every facet of life. By following her husband, the wife shows love to her husband. Remember, love is not described in Scripture as an emotion; it is an action. Paul&#39;s final verse ends by telling the wife to respect her husband. This is the purist sign of love: respect and obedience. Again, Scripture doesn&#39;t imply it will be easy to obey, but it is something we can do with the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>\n<p>\n\tMoving in the direction of obedience and subjection to our husbands can begin in small ways. We start in ways the Spirit leads. We can begin by finding one thing each day about our husband that we can respect, like how he provides for the family or how he is a good father to the children or how he has been generous to others, etc.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy looking for a small starting point in respecting her husband, a wife can move in the direction of obedience and love by rely on the Holy Spirit to give &nbsp;herstrength in this process. When our struggle to show respect or subject to his authority wanes, we should pray that the Holy Spirit will open our eyes to see something else we can respect in our husband and begin the process again.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul follows this same pattern of teaching again in the book of Colossians chapter 3.</p>\n<h5>\n\tCol. 3:12&nbsp; And so, as those who have been&nbsp; chosen of God, holy and beloved,&nbsp; put on a&nbsp; heart of compassion, kindness,&nbsp; humility, gentleness and&nbsp;&nbsp; patience;<br />\n\tCol. 3:13&nbsp; bearing with one another, and&nbsp; forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone;&nbsp; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.<br />\n\tCol. 3:14&nbsp; And beyond all these things put on love, which is&nbsp;&nbsp; the perfect bond of&nbsp; unity.<br />\n\tCol. 3:15&nbsp; And let&nbsp; the peace of Christ&nbsp; rule in your hearts, to which&nbsp; indeed you were called in one body; and&nbsp; be thankful.<br />\n\tCol. 3:16&nbsp; Let the word of&nbsp; Christ richly dwell within you,&nbsp; with all wisdom&nbsp; teaching and admonishing one another&nbsp; with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,&nbsp; singing&nbsp; with thankfulness in your hearts to God.<br />\n\tCol. 3:17&nbsp; And&nbsp; whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,&nbsp; giving thanks through Him to God the Father.<br />\n\tCol. 3:18&nbsp;&nbsp; Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.<br />\n\tCol. 3:19&nbsp; Husbands, love your wives, and do not be embittered against them.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPaul begins with the same example of how the Church should conduct itself now that we have come to faith. Then he moves to the more specific calling of individuals in the Body and what each group is called to do in Christ. In v.12 Paul gives a comprehensive description of how we are to treat one other in the faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tNotice he specifically says we should \"put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity.\" Perhaps you sensed the truth of this verse when you said you knew love is more than a feeling. The Bible affirms this view. We can&#39;t put on a feeling, but we can put on the actions that Paul listed.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are called to act in love even when we don&#39;t feel loving. This choice brings unity to the Body of Christ and to our marriages. Paul gives a precise description of Christian love in vs.12-13, then Paul moves to giving specific directions for the more intimate relationship of marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, he begins with the wife first in v.18 saying, \"Be subject to your husbands&hellip;\" with the clarifier, \"&hellip;as is fitting in the Lord.\" Paul is saying a wife should be subject to her husband without doing anything that would go against the Lord. So as long as the husband is not asking the wife to sin, then she is to be subject to the husband.</p>\n<p>\n\tNotice in both of these passages that Paul admonishes the husbands also to love their wives. More time is given to the man&#39;s responsibilities than to the wife&#39;s, in keeping with the man&#39;s greater responsibility in maintaining a strong relationship in the Church and in the family. But the wife has her role as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, 1Peter 3 gives direction to wives, but to understand chapter 3, we must drop back into 1Peter 1 briefly:&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Pet. 1:17&nbsp; And if you address as Father the One who&nbsp; impartially&nbsp; judges according to each man&rsquo;s work, conduct yourselves&nbsp; in fear during the time of your&nbsp; stay upon earth;<br />\n\t1Pet. 1:18&nbsp; knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your&nbsp; futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,<br />\n\t1Pet. 1:19&nbsp; but with precious blood, as of a&nbsp; lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPeter taught that because we call God our Father, then we must conduct ourselves in fear during our time on earth. By our fear of God, we gain the courage to do all that Peter teaches in the rest of his letter. Peter&#39;s third chapter then providing specific calls of behavior in submitting ourselves to all forms of earthly authority. Peter reminds us that these earthly forms of authority as always from God.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeter begins in chapter 3 with a discussion of slaves. It is important to note this, because when Paul moves to discussing wives in 1Peter 3:1, he says \"In the same way&hellip;\"&nbsp; Peter told the servants and slaves of that day to be subject to their masters, whether they are treated fairly or not. This kind of obedient behavior became the slave&#39;s way to stand apart from the non-believing slaves of their day.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeter uses Christ&#39;s obedience as our example to follow in the way Jesus was mistreated though innocent. He did not defend Himself; He submitted. Christ is the example of how we are to behave in subjection to authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen Peter transitions to wives by saying they are to follow the same example. They obey and respect their husbands - not because the husband is always deserving of honor but because Christ&#39;s submission teaches us to obey despite mistreatment, because it honors the Lord.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow let&#39;s look at what Peter addresses to wives specifically.</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Pet. 3:1&nbsp; In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be&nbsp; won without a word by the behavior of their wives,<br />\n\t1Pet. 3:2&nbsp; as they observe your chaste and&nbsp; respectful behavior.<br />\n\t1Pet. 3:3&nbsp; And let not your adornment be merely external &mdash; braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses;<br />\n\t1Pet. 3:4&nbsp; but let it be&nbsp; the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.<br />\n\t1Pet. 3:5&nbsp; For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands.<br />\n\t1Pet. 3:6&nbsp; Thus Sarah obeyed Abraham,&nbsp; calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right&nbsp;&nbsp; without being frightened by any fear.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAgain, wives are told to be submissive to husbands, and it does not depend on whether the husband deserves it. Peter emphasizes that a woman&#39;s beauty is determined not by what she does externally but by what is in the heart, that is a gentle and quiet spirit as we see in v.4. Peter says this is precious in the sight of God.</p>\n<p>\n\tSuch internal submission and obedience is how we please God, and the Lord will judge wives by how we met His expectations in honoring our husbands.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeter ends this section with a wonderful example from the story of Sarah. Sarah obeyed Abraham, even calling him Lord, Peter says. Keep in mind that Abraham is not portrayed in Scripture as perfect, especially in his dealing with his wife Sarah.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeter&#39;s point is that Sarah still obeyed her less-than-perfect husband, and therefore she is seen in Scripture as a woman who did what was right in the sight of God.&nbsp; Amazing!</p>\n<p>\n\tYou have a husband that is from the Lord. You want to be the wife God has called you to be in His Word, therefore you need to turn to the Holy Spirit to find the strength to submit and obey your husband, which is what you are called to do in your service to Christ and it is how you will be measured by God in your judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe cannot promise you that in the end you will come to feel love for your husband, especially the emotional, romantic love you desire. You may at least reach a point of respectful admiration or brotherly love by God&#39;s grace. In either case, love will only come because you committed to obeying the Lord by submitting to your husband and respecting his authority. In the meantime, you can rest in the knowledge that you are worshipping your Lord and pleasing Him by your obedience.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn many cases where there are intimacy problems in a marriage, the marriage is lacking in good communication. If the couple is not communicating well, problems will go unresolved, and over time they can become barriers to intimacy. If communication in the marriage has broken down, then we recommend seeking professional help from a Christian counselor skilled in working through these issues. Counseling is often little more than communication education. Perhaps your church can help guide you in this area in helping you find someone who can counsel with the scriptures as their guide.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe you can work on becoming a more obedient and submissive wife while ministering to others, but the final answer is only something that you and the Lord can know. Seek His will on that question.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur desire and prayer is that the importance of becoming the kind of a wife God has called you to be in His word will be your motivator for worship and in your family relationships. See this situation as a test God has graciously given you, and as James taught:</p>\n<h5>\n\tJames 1:2&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter&nbsp; various trials,<br />\n\tJames 1:3&nbsp; knowing that&nbsp; the testing of your faith produces&nbsp;&nbsp; endurance.<br />\n\tJames 1:4&nbsp; And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.<br />\n\tJames 1:5&nbsp; But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.</h5>"

They believe it literally means we can becomes gods, but I know that isn&#39;t correct.</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. We believe the best answer comes from Dr. Thomas Constable, who explains:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"In Psalms 82:2-7 the Psalmists says that Israel&#39;s judges were perverting justice. God called them to practice righteous justice. The essence of proper judging was making sure that the defenseless got justice. Israel&#39;s judges, who should have been the wisest of the people, were ignorant of the importance of fair judgment and the consequences of unfair judging. Consequently law and order, the foundations of life on earth, were unstable.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"In vs.6-7 God warned the unjust judges that they would suffer judgment themselves for their injustice. God had appointed them as \"gods\" (i.e., individuals with power by God&#39;s authority). He had made them His \"sons\" in the sense they were His representatives on earth (see 2 Sam. 7:14). Nevertheless because they had not behaved as God, who judges justly, they would die as mere men without honor as God&#39;s sons. They would die as all the other Israelites would. (\"Men\" and \"rulers\" (v. 7) is a merism that signifies all mortals.)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>\"Jesus&#39; accusers charged Him with blasphemy when He claimed to be the Son of God (John 10:33). In replying to their accusation Jesus quoted Psalm 82:6 to remind them that God called Israel&#39;s judges His sons. His point was that it was not inappropriate for Him to call Himself the Son of God. Jesus, of course, is God&#39;s ultimate Judge of all humankind, so it was especially appropriate for Him to call Himself the Son of God.\"</em></p>\n<h6>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.soniclight.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>(Taken from Constables Notes on Psalms, page 157)</em></a></h6>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I read in Malachi 4 that God promises to restore the hearts of children to their fathers. If I claim this promise for myself, may I believe that God will restore my relationship with my children?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. It is never appropriate to assume that any particular Biblical promise is addressed to us individually. The vast majority of Biblical promises are made to specific individual or groups (usually Israel) and are not applicable to all believers. For example, the promise in Malachi 4 was not a promise delivered to a Christian today.&nbsp; Malachi 4 is speaking concerning unbelieving Jewish people living in the time of Tribulation.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Malachi 4, we find the follow prophecy:</p>\n<p>\n\tMal. 4:5&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD.<br />\n\tMal. 4:6 &ldquo;He will restore the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, so that I will not come and smite the land with a&nbsp; curse.&rdquo;<br />\n\t<br />\n\tThe prophecy in Malachi (repeated in Luke 1:17) is a promise speaking to Israel concerning the days of Tribulation. The timing for this promise is said to be \"before the great and terrible day of the Lord.\" This phrase is a reference to the time of Tribulation, a time of retribution and judgment promised for the Jewish people and for the world. Prior to Tribulation, Malachi says the prophet Elijah will return to preach to Israel, and that preaching will result in the hearts of children returning to the fathers and the fathers to the children.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this context, the phrase \"children\" is a reference to the descendants of Israel and the phrase \"fathers\" is a reference to the Jewish patriarchs and prophets. Specifically, Malachi is promising that Elijah&#39;s return will result in Israel returning to observing the the Biblical traditions of orthodox Judaism and to following the example of the \"fathers of Israel\" in their observance of Jewish Law. Elijah&#39;s call to return to the Law will lead the nation of Israel to a revival during the first part of Tribulation.</p>\n<p>\n\tGod&#39;s purpose in this revival will be to encourage many in Israel to join in worship at the newly reconstructed Jewish temple during Tribulation.&nbsp; You can learn more about this purpose in our ongoing <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/\">Revelation study</a></strong>, specifically in Lesson 11.</p>\n<p>\n\tGod delivers promises to specific people or groups, and so we cannot \"claim\" a promise in Scripture for ourselves. The Bible never instructs us to engage in such a practice, and there is no mechanism given in Scripture by which we can redirect God&#39;s promises to ourselves and apart from His intentions. The concept of \"claiming\" promises that were originally given to other people is an invention of false teachers, and sadly it has become a part of modern Christian culture.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn reality, God&#39;s promises cannot be appropriate for our own desires. Instead, the context of Scripture must guide our interpretation and application of any Scripture, including our application of God&#39;s promises. His promises are only applicable to the audience(s) He intended by His word. Only when we find clear intent in Scripture that a promise was intended to apply to all believers universally (as when Christ promised that all believers will receive the Holy Spirit) can we then assume that the promise is ours as well. In the case of Malachi 4, however, the intended audience for God&#39;s promise was Israel during Tribulation.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, if you believe God has indicated to you personally in some manner that He intends to restore your family or heal a broken relationship, then you can trust in that assurance, for the Lord will do as He has said. If such a work of restoration does happen in your life, you should give God the glory but you should not claim that this work of God was a fulfillment of His promises in Malachi 4.</p>"

Since you raised the question of how salvation works, we want to begin our answer with a clear and concise explanation of the salvation God has made available to men. According to Scripture, salvation from the penalty for sin is made possible by our faith in the work of Christ, Who atoned for our sin by His death on the cross in our place. All that God requires as payment for our sin was accomplished by Jesus on the cross.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, our personal works play no part in our salvation.&nbsp; We can add nothing to the accomplishments of Christ on the cross, and therefore only by faith in His work may we be saved. Our faith is in the sufficiency of Christ&#39;s work and the truth of His claims to be the Son of God, and our faith takes the place of relying on our personal works of righteousness. This is the heart of the Gospel.</p>\n\n<p>If you believe that Jesus is the Lord, the Son of God, and that His death and resurrection is proof of His claims, then the Bible commands you to confess this belief and receive water baptism as a sign of your faith. Having made this confession, the Bible says you will be saved. The word of God leaves no doubt or question concerning this outcome. The moment of your faith is the moment of your salvation&hellip;by faith you have already been saved! Consider the following statements from Scripture:</p>\n\n<h5>Rom. 10:9&nbsp; that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;</h5>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:4 But God, being&nbsp; rich in mercy, because of&nbsp; His great love with which He loved us,<br />\nEph. 2:5 even when we were&nbsp; dead&nbsp; in our transgressions, made us alive together&nbsp; with Christ ( by grace you have been saved),<br />\nEph. 2:6 and&nbsp; raised us up with Him, and&nbsp; seated us with Him in&nbsp; the heavenly places in&nbsp; Christ Jesus,<br />\nEph. 2:7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing&nbsp; riches of His grace in&nbsp; kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</h5>\n\n<h5>Eph. 1:13 In&nbsp; Him, you also, after listening to&nbsp; the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation &mdash; having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,<br />\nEph. 1:14 who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of&nbsp; God&rsquo;s own possession,&nbsp; to the praise of His glory.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The Bible testifies that those who confess faith in Christ receive a downpayment on their eternal inheritance, which is the Holy Spirit taking up residence in our hearts. This downpayment is God&#39;s pledge to us that the work He has begun through our faith He promises He will bring to completion in the day of our resurrection, as Paul says:</p>\n\n<h5>Phil. 1:6 For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h4>Am I Saved?</h4>\n\n<p>Regarding your concerns of not being saved, rest assured that such doubts and feelings are normal for Christians. The enemy delights to bring doubts to our mind and to cause us to wonder if we are \"good enough.\" The irony is that we <strong><em>aren&#39;t</em></strong> good enough to be saved! We never were. We don&#39;t merit the salvation we have received, and we can never allow ourselves to think that we \"deserved\" God&#39;s grace. Grace, by definition, is not deserved or earned.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, our faith is a gift of God. It did not depend on our own resolve or determination to believe. The Bible says our belief is a gift from God, as Paul explains:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;<br />\nEph. 2:9&nbsp; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Finally, John wrote to those who have the Spirit and know the truth of the Gospel to address this very doubt of whether we are truly saved.&nbsp; He said:</p>\n\n<h5>1John 3:23 &nbsp;This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us.<br />\n1John 3:24 &nbsp;The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him.&nbsp; We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.</h5>\n\n<h5>1John 4:4 &nbsp;You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.<br />\n1John 4:5&nbsp; They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world listens to them.<br />\n1John 4:6&nbsp; We are from God; he who knows God listens to us;&nbsp; he who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.<br />\n1John 4:7 &nbsp;Beloved, let us&nbsp; love one another, for love is from God; and&nbsp; everyone who loves is born of God and&nbsp; knows God.<br />\n1John 4:8 &nbsp;The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love.</h5>\n\n<h5>1John 4:13&nbsp; By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.<br />\n1John 4:14 &nbsp;We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.<br />\n1John 4:15 &nbsp;Whoever confesses that&nbsp; Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>John wrote to assure the church that we can know for certain we are God&#39;s children by our post-salvation experiences, especially by our awareness that the Spirit has come to dwell in us through the changes we witness in our life. Among other changes, John mentions that we will enjoy fellowship with other believers, we will feel separated from the world of unbelievers, we will begin to love one another with God&#39;s sacrificial love, and we will grow to abide in Christ (i.e., depend on Him and follow Him).</p>\n\n<p>More than all else, John says we have assurance of salvation simply by the certainty of our confession. Whoever confesses (i.e., gives a truthful testimony) that Jesus is the Son of God is saved, John reiterates.</p>\n\n<p>In our experience, only Christians spend time worrying about whether they are truly saved. Unbelievers aren&#39;t troubled by thoughts or worries of not having salvation in Christ, because they are unfamiliar with God&#39;s grace and therefore they cannot know what they do not have.&nbsp; In a sense, only those who have come to know the grace of God will worry over the prospect of <strong><em>not</em></strong> having it. For many Christians, these concerns simply testify to a relationship with Christ.</p>\n\n<p>The process of maturing in our walk of faith is a process of moving beyond these doubts and questions and taking hold of our salvation and pursuing maturity in our witness and understanding of God.&nbsp; The writer of Hebrews says:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 6:17&nbsp; In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise&nbsp; the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath,<br />\nHeb. 6:18 so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of&nbsp; the hope set before us.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>God has sworn by His own name that His purposes and promises are unchangeable, so that we who have been saved would have confidence to take hold of the hope set before us. Having taken hold of that hope, we will be encouraged to walk in faith not looking back in doubt.&nbsp; This is the upward call of Christ, as Paul calls it:</p>\n\n<h5>Phil. 3:12&nbsp; Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.<br />\nPhil. 3:13 Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead,<br />\nPhil. 3:14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>So based on your confession of faith in your letter to us, we encourage you to take heart that you know the Lord and that your worries are natural and shared by many Christians at various times. &nbsp;Your worries testify to the Spirit working in your heart convicting you of sin and preparing you for a life of holiness in serving the Lord. Move beyond your doubts and begin to ask how you can better serve the Lord Who saved you.&nbsp; Glory be to God!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. In one teaching you say Christians are not bound to follow the Mosaic Law, but later when you taught that any sins committed in ignorance are still counted as an offense to God, you cited Leviticus to prove your point. I&#39;m confused...do we follow the instructions of the Law or not?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. While the Christian is not bound by the Law of Moses (<a href=\"/resource_library/articles/on_law_and_liberty_part_1/\">as we explained</a>), this does not mean that the Law and related Scripture are meaningless for a Christian. As Paul said:</p>\n\n<h5>2Tim. 3:16&nbsp; All Scripture is&nbsp; inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for&nbsp; training in righteousness;</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nChristians are commanded to read and learn from <em>all</em> Scripture, but learning from the Law of Moses is not the same thing as being bound to keep the Law of Moses. For example, the Christian is not bound to <a href=\"/resource_library/questions_and_answers/how_much_do_i_have_to_tithe/\">pay tithes</a> as prescribed by the Law, but by studying the Law concerning tithing we come to learn important truths concerning giving to the work of God, (e.g., that the Lord provides for His priests and ministers through the giving of those who receive the service of those ministers).</p>\n\n<p>Studying the lessons of the Law found in the Old Testament reinforces New Testament principles and gives context for God&#39;s expectations. &nbsp;For example, in the New Testament we learn that a pastor or teacher is worthy of double honor and should receive support from those they shepherd, as Paul taught:</p>\n\n<h6>1Tim. 5:17&nbsp; The elders who&nbsp; rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who&nbsp; work hard&nbsp; at preaching and teaching.<br />\n1Tim. 5:18 For the Scripture says, &ldquo; YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING,&rdquo; and &ldquo; The laborer is worthy of his wages.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>The context for why this principle is true can be found in the Old Testament law where God explained His desire that His ministers receive support from those they serve. So the study of God&#39;s Law in the Old Testament is valuable and instructive and necessary, but we are not expected to follow it as one bound by it.&nbsp; As Paul himself says:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 6:14 For&nbsp; sin shall not&nbsp; be master over you, for&nbsp; you are not under law but&nbsp; under grace<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Regarding the specific question of sinning in ignorance, we were teaching how a person may sin without specific knowledge they were sinning. Even though they may be ignorant of their sin, it is still an offense to God and requires atonement.&nbsp; Jesus&#39; atoning work covers all sins, including sins we commit in ignorance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Like all sin, any sins committed in ignorance may result in earthly consequences, but our eternal judgment have been paid already by Christ. This is why the Bible says clearly:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 8:1&nbsp; Therefore there is now no&nbsp; condemnation for those who are in&nbsp; Christ Jesus.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>As Christians, we do not have condemnation from God for our sins because we have faith in Jesus Christ and His death on our behalf.&nbsp; All Christians stand before God without condemnation because Jesus paid the entire price for our sin, and this fact doesn&#39;t change because some sins are committed purposefully or accidentally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sin is sin, and Christ&#39;s payment was sufficient to cover all sins. We may suffer earthly consequences for our sin, as all men do, but we will not see an eternal penalty for our sin.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I have been trying to witness to an unbelieving relative I will call \"Laura,\" but it has been a difficult conversation. After I spoke with her recently about Christianity, she sent me an email with a long description of secular humanism, which was her retort to my explanation of Christianity. &nbsp;What is secular humanism and how do I reach someone who believes this way?<br />\n\t&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tA. First, we commend you for your willingness to engage your family members in this important discussion. We know how challenging it can be to present the Gospel to family members, and we remember Jesus&#39; words when He said:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMark 6:4 Jesus said to them, &ldquo; A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tSecular humanism is just the latest label for an age-old perspective that holds human reason and intellect as higher values than religious faith. The information in your family member&#39;s response was copied from a well-known online resource for paganism and anti-religious viewpoints.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven though your relative appears to be engaging with you in this debate, in reality she is attempting to shut down the conversation to prevent you from presenting the Gospel. Laura was probably hoping the material she copied and sent you would put an end to your efforts. Most likely she is uncomfortable in engaging in this discussion personally, perhaps out of ignorance or an insecurity, and so she relied on someone else&#39;s words instead.</p>\n<p>\n\tIronically, this may be a good thing for your purposes, since it suggests she may be unprepared to defend her views and that the Lord may be at work to open her eyes. Since Laura side-stepped the conversation, we recommend you keep trying to engage her in the very thing she is avoiding: the truth of God&#39;s word.</p>\n<p>\n\tRather than responding to her copied content point-for-point (which just moves you further away from a discussion of the Gospel and God&#39;s word), we recommend you continue to speak to her from Scripture.&nbsp; Explain the holiness of God and the sinful nature of men, explain the problem with our sin when it comes into the presence of a holy and just God Who must act in perfect justice, and explain the opportunity to escape that judgment by the grace of a loving God Who died for us.&nbsp; These are the facts Laura was probably trying to avoid as she threw up the smokescreen of secular humanism.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, keep in mind that secular humanism is nothing new and nothing different. Since the time of Cain, men had tried to see themselves as independent of God and capable of finding truth apart from God. The reality of our accountability to an all-powerful, all-knowing God is both inconvenient and convicting, and so mankind has sought to suppress this conviction by changing the topic away from God and toward nature, science, fate, and other sources for human wisdom.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul put it this way:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 1:20 For&nbsp; since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen,&nbsp; being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.<br />\n\tRom. 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not&nbsp; honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became&nbsp; futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.<br />\n\tRom. 1:22&nbsp; Professing to be wise, they became fools,<br />\n\tRom. 1:23 and&nbsp; exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and&nbsp; crawling creatures. &nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn reality, the enlightened reason of human secularism is neither enlightened nor reasonable. The Bible says the so-called wisdom of men is actually foolishness. The unbelieving men are deceived by the enemy, yet have no appreciation for the depths and power of that deception. Paul taught again:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Cor. 4:3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,<br />\n\t2Cor. 4:4 in whose case&nbsp; the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving&nbsp; so that they might not see the&nbsp; light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the&nbsp; image of God.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, there is reason to hope that your efforts to reach your sister will be effect.&nbsp; God is capable of breaking through your sister&#39;s blindness and bringing her to a knowledge of the truth.&nbsp; Paul says it this way:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Cor. 1:18&nbsp; For the word of the cross is&nbsp; foolishness to&nbsp; those who&nbsp; are perishing, but to us who&nbsp; are being saved it is&nbsp; the power of God.<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:19 For it is written,<br />\n\t&ldquo; I WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE,<br />\n\tAND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER I WILL SET ASIDE.&rdquo;<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:20&nbsp; Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of&nbsp; this age? Has not God&nbsp; made foolish the wisdom of&nbsp; the world?<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:21 For since in the wisdom of God&nbsp; the world through its wisdom did not come to know God,&nbsp; God was well-pleased through the&nbsp; foolishness of the&nbsp; message preached to&nbsp; save those who believe.<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:22 For indeed&nbsp; Jews ask for&nbsp; signs and Greeks search for wisdom;<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:23 but we preach&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ crucified,&nbsp; to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles&nbsp; foolishness,<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:24 but to those who are&nbsp; the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ&nbsp; the power of God and&nbsp; the wisdom of God.<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:25 Because the&nbsp; foolishness of God is wiser than men, and&nbsp; the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPaul taught that the story of the cross of Christ was designed by God to appear foolish to those who think themselves wise, so that He may shame human wisdom by the \"foolishness\" of His plan of salvation. God also delights, however, to save those who believe in the message of the Gospel by the power of God. And the foolish and weak message of the Gospel is far wiser than the so-called wisdom of men, and the power of the Gospel to save is far stronger than the strength of men to save themselves by their efforts at \"reason.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, take heart in knowing that if God is at work through you to save Laura, then His efforts cannot be stopped, and her adherence to pagan principles will one day give way to the truth of the Gospel.&nbsp; In the meantime, continue to focus your conversation on the truth of the Gospel and don&#39;t get distracted in debates over the things she copies from the internet and throws in your face.</p>\n<p>\n\tLike all unbelievers, she desperately needs to hear the very conversation she is trying to avoid.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

What about people who say they have visited Heaven and come back? And is there any benefit in praying for someone who has already died in unbelief?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The Bible teaches that after death comes to the body, our spirit exists eternally. After the believer&#39;s body&nbsp;dies, angels will escort our spirit to Jesus&#39; presence in the Throne Room. The unbeliever&#39;s spirit descends to&nbsp;Hades (Hell) to wait in&nbsp;torment until they are resurrected into new bodies for&nbsp;a day of judgment at the Great White Throne Judgment described in Revelation 20. Believers receive&nbsp;&nbsp;new bodies on a different day of Resurrection, also called the Rapture.</p>\n\n<p>These courses are set permanently at death. There is no <a href=\"/bible-answers/will_unbelievers_get_a_second_chance\">second chance for salvation</a>, and no one can alter their destiny following death, as Hebrews teaches:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 9:27 And inasmuch as&nbsp; it is&nbsp; appointed for men to die once and after this&nbsp; comes judgment,<br />\nHeb. 9:28 so Christ also, having been&nbsp; offered once to&nbsp; bear the sins of many, will appear&nbsp; a second time for&nbsp; salvation&nbsp; without reference to sin, to those who&nbsp; eagerly await Him.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<div><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, praying on behalf of the souls of departed unbelievers may be understandable, but it is a desire contrary to scripture and therefore we can&#39;t expect the Lord to honor a prayer that asks HIm to act contrary to His own word.&nbsp;</span></div>\n\n<div><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Regarding,&nbsp;the stories of people who have visited heaven, we believe these stories are something other than a true vision of Heaven.&nbsp; These visions are likely the result of demonic deception, hallucinations or even outright lies.&nbsp;Most of the stories are sensationalized by the media, but as Christians we don&#39;t gain out knowledge of the spiritual realm from such experiences.</span></div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In fact, it is dangerous to incorporate worldly experience into our theology, since our world and even our sense lie to us.&nbsp; The Bible was given to us so that we might have all we need to understand God and His plan fully.&nbsp; As Peter explains:</span></div>\n\n<h5>2Pet. 1:2&nbsp; Grace and peace be multiplied to you in&nbsp; the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;<br />\n2Pet. 1:3 seeing that His&nbsp; divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true&nbsp; knowledge of Him who&nbsp; called us&nbsp; by His own glory and&nbsp; excellence.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Consequently, we encourage you to seek for the truth of God through His word and not to rely on these supposed experiences to form your understanding of spiritual things.&nbsp; Our experiences and emotions easily manipulated by the enemy to fool us.&nbsp; As Paul said:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 11:14 No wonder, for even&nbsp; Satan disguises himself as an&nbsp; angel of light.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For more information on this area of study, we recommend you follow our </span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/\">Revelation</a></strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"> Bible study.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. My sister, who I love dearly, is not a Christian. I started sending her information about Christianity and trying to chat to her about the Gospel, but in response she sent me information on human secularism, indicating this was her belief. &nbsp;How should I respond?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tA. First, we commend you for your willingness to engage your family members in this important discussion. We know how challenging it can be to present the Gospel to family members, and we remember Jesus&#39; words when He said:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMark 6:4 Jesus said to them, &ldquo; A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his own relatives and in his own household.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tSecular humanism is just the latest label for an age-old perspective that maintains human reason and wisdom are higher truths than religious faith. The information in your sister&#39;s response was simply copied from a well-known online resource for paganism and anti-religious viewpoints.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tEven though she appears to be engaging with you in this debate, in reality your sister is attempting to shut down the conversation to prevent you from presenting the Gospel to her. She was probably hoping the material she copied and sent you would put an end to your efforts. Most likely your sister is uncomfortable in engaging in this discussion personally, perhaps out of ignorance or an insecurity, and so she relied on someone else&#39;s words instead.</p>\n<p>\n\tIronically, this may be a good thing for your purposes, since it suggests she may be unprepared to defend her views and that the Lord may be at work to open her eyes. Since your sister side-stepped the conversation, we recommend you keep trying to engage her in the very thing she is avoiding: the truth of God&#39;s word.</p>\n<p>\n\tRather than responding to her copied content point-for-point (which just moves you further away from the Gospel and God&#39;s word), continue to speak from Scripture.&nbsp; Explain the holiness of God and the sinful nature of men, explain the problem with our sin when it comes into the presence of a holy and just God Who must act in perfect justice, and explain the opportunity to escape that judgment by the grace of a loving God Who died for us. These are the facts your sister was probably trying to avoid as she threw up the smokescreen of describing secular humanism.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, keep in mind that secular humanism is nothing new and nothing different. Since the time of Cain, men had tried to see themselves as independent of God and capable of finding truth apart from God. The reality of our accountability to an all-powerful, all-knowing God is both inconvenient and convicting, and so mankind has sought to suppress this conviction by changing the topic away from God and toward nature, science, fate, and other sources for human wisdom. Paul put it this way:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 1:20 For&nbsp; since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen,&nbsp; being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.<br />\n\tRom. 1:21 For even though they knew God, they did not&nbsp; honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became&nbsp; futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.<br />\n\tRom. 1:22&nbsp; Professing to be wise, they became fools,<br />\n\tRom. 1:23 and&nbsp; exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and&nbsp; crawling creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn reality, the enlightened reason of human secularism is neither enlightened nor reasonable. The Bible says the so-called wisdom of men is actually foolishness. The unbelieving men are deceived by the enemy, yet have no appreciation for the depths and power of that deception. Paul taught again:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Cor. 4:3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,<br />\n\t2Cor. 4:4 in whose case&nbsp; the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving&nbsp; so that they might not see the&nbsp; light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the&nbsp; image of God.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, there is reason to hope that your efforts to reach your sister will be effect.&nbsp; God is capable of breaking through your sister&#39;s blindness and bringing her to a knowledge of the truth.&nbsp; Paul says it this way:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Cor. 1:18&nbsp; For the word of the cross is&nbsp; foolishness to&nbsp; those who&nbsp; are perishing, but to us who&nbsp; are being saved it is&nbsp; the power of God.<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:19 For it is written,<br />\n\t&ldquo; I WILL DESTROY THE WISDOM OF THE WISE,<br />\n\tAND THE CLEVERNESS OF THE CLEVER I WILL SET ASIDE.&rdquo;<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:20&nbsp; Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of&nbsp; this age? Has not God&nbsp; made foolish the wisdom of&nbsp; the world?<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:21 For since in the wisdom of God&nbsp; the world through its wisdom did not come to know God,&nbsp; God was well-pleased through the&nbsp; foolishness of the&nbsp; message preached to&nbsp; save those who believe.<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:22 For indeed&nbsp; Jews ask for&nbsp; signs and Greeks search for wisdom;<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:23 but we preach&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ crucified,&nbsp; to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles&nbsp; foolishness,<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:24 but to those who are&nbsp; the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ&nbsp; the power of God and&nbsp; the wisdom of God.<br />\n\t1Cor. 1:25 Because the&nbsp; foolishness of God is wiser than men, and&nbsp; the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPaul taught that the story of the cross of Christ was designed by God to sound foolish to those who think themselves wise, so He may shame human wisdom by His plan of salvation. God also delights, however, to save those who believe in the message of the Gospel by the power of God. And the foolish and weak message of the Gospel is far wiser than the so-called wisdom of men, and the power of the Gospel to save is far stronger than the strength of men to save themselves by their efforts at \"reason.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, take heart in knowing that if God is at work through you to save your sister, then His efforts cannot be stopped, and your sister&#39;s adherence to pagan principles will one day give way to the truth of the Gospel.&nbsp; In the meantime, continue to focus your conversation on the truth of the Gospel and don&#39;t get distracted in debates over things she copies from the internet and throws in your face. Like all unbelievers, she desperately needs to hear the very conversation she is trying to avoid.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Since a woman may not hold leadership over a man in the Church, is it permissible for a woman to evangelize to a man? I have a gentlemen I know who is interested in hearing the Gospel, but as a woman I&#39;m not sure I should be the one to bring him through a spiritual discussion. Should I direct him to my pastor?</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tA. First, we applaud your sensitivity to the issue of headship. The Bible calls for men to take the leadership role within the church, particularly in the realm of teaching.&nbsp; On the other hand, every believer is called to witness to the truth of the Gospel at every opportunity.&nbsp; Pastors and men in general are not \"specially commissioned\" to share the Gospel.&nbsp; On the contrary, all Christians are commissioned to share their faith.&nbsp; As Peter wrote:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Pet. 3:15 but&nbsp; sanctify&nbsp; Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready&nbsp; to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet&nbsp; with gentleness and reverence;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPeter wasn&#39;t writing this instruction only to the men in the church or to pastors; he was writing to the entire Church. So you should feel free to embrace the opportunities the Lord gives to explain your faith and share the Gospel, whether to women or to men.&nbsp; Many men have been led to faith by the witness of a faithful woman, especially mothers to their sons and wives to their husbands.&nbsp; This situation does not threaten the Biblical call for headship, since it is impossible for a Christian to assume the role of spiritual authority over an unbeliever.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tShould your efforts to witness to this man prove successful, then you should anticipate the need ultimately to refer this man to other godly men in the Church who may disciple him and minister to his needs.&nbsp; In this way, you are both respecting male headship while at the same time seizing the opportunity to use your spiritual gifts and the power of your testimony to further the Kingdom and glorify the Lord.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, we always advise Christians to remain vigilant in any situation in which you could be engaged in potentially sensitive and emotionally-charged discussions with someone of the opposite sex, especially if one or both of the individuals are married.&nbsp; Unfortunately, sharing our faith with the opposite sex can lead to unwanted advances, and the enemy often exploits these contacts to tempt believers into sin or to give opportunity for false accusations.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, always conduct such conversations in a public space or under the watchful eye of other men or women who can protect you from a compromising situation or false accusations. Never agree to meet alone with a person of the opposite sex in a home or in a car, and avoid engaging in frequent phone conversations without disclosing those conversations to a brother or sister in the Church.</p>"

The Bible has much to say concerning the destination of men&#39;s souls at death and the dwelling place for demons.&nbsp; First, the Bible teaches in 1Corinthians 15 that our existence is&nbsp;one&nbsp;partly of flesh and partly of spirit. The flesh of our bodies is destined to end at our physical death, but our spirit is eternal. Therefore, when our physical body dies, our spirit must go to a new place.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus teaches in Luke 16 that God has prepared a place of confinement for the souls of those who die without faith. The place is called Hades, which we call Hell. This place holds the souls of all men who have died without faith in God&#39;s promises (i.e., unbelievers), and these persons will remain in soul-form in Hades until the day of their judgment. That day is called the Great White Throne Judgment, which is described in Revelation 20:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRev. 20:12 And I saw the dead, the&nbsp; great and the small, standing before the throne, and&nbsp;&nbsp; books were opened; and another&nbsp; book was opened, which is&nbsp; the book of life; and the dead&nbsp; were judged from the things which were written in the&nbsp; books,&nbsp; according to their deeds.<br />\n\tRev. 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and&nbsp; death and Hades&nbsp; gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them&nbsp; according to their deeds.<br />\n\tRev. 20:14 Then&nbsp; death and Hades were thrown into&nbsp; the lake of fire. This is the&nbsp; second death, the lake of fire.<br />\n\tRev. 20:15 And if&nbsp; anyone&rsquo;s name was not found written in&nbsp; the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tOnce the Great White Throne Judgment concludes, the souls of all unbelievers will be condemned for their sin and cast into the Lake of Fire, which is their final eternal home. Jude 7 speaks of this eternal home.</p>\n<h5>\n\tJude 7 just as&nbsp; Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after&nbsp; strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tFinally, the bottomless pit or the abyss is a place where God keeps demons captive until they receive their judgment and punishment, also in the Lake of Fire.&nbsp; Luke 8 references this holding place:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLuke 8:30 And Jesus asked him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo; Legion&rdquo;; for many demons had entered him.<br />\n\tLuke 8:31 They were imploring Him not to command them to go away into&nbsp; the abyss.&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tYou can learn much more about these two places in our <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/\"><strong>Revelation course</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>"

Yes it is possible for a person to sin without knowing it, including a Christian. Sin is any offense against God, and even when we lack a full knowledge of what offends God or the self-awareness to recognize that our actions are offensive, nevertheless we are still acting in a way that offends Him.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Bible teaches this truth in both the Old and New Testament. In the Law given to Israel through Moses, the Lord described many requirements for the people of Israel. God told them not to murder and not to commit adultery, but Jesus said that hating a person was equivalent to murder in the sense that it was a sin coming from a similar sinful heart. Likewise, lusting was equivalent to adultery, Jesus said.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo even though Israel&#39;s Law did not prohibit lusting or hating specifically, those behaviors were still sin.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, many Jews were guilty of these unnamed sins and never knew it. Therefore, God specifically described unintentional sin in the Law:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLev. 5:17&nbsp; &ldquo;Now if a person sins and does any of the things&nbsp; which the LORD has commanded not to be done,&nbsp; though he was unaware, still he is guilty and shall bear his punishment.<br />\n\tLev. 5:18 &ldquo;He is then to bring to the priest&nbsp; a ram without defect from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his error in which he sinned&nbsp; unintentionally and did not know it, and it will be forgiven him.</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tNotice the Lord said that even when a person is unaware of their sin, he is still guilty.&nbsp; For this reason, God made a sacrifice available to the people of God in the Law to cover their unintentional sin.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, today Christians can sin in ways we don&#39;t fully appreciate, but our ignorance doesn&#39;t lessen our sin. We are supposed to remain forever in study of His word and under counsel of the Spirit so that we might better understand God&#39;s expectations and thereby cease sinning. Nevertheless, by our faith in Christ all our sins are forgiven - both those we know and those we don&#39;t know - so that we stand before Him eternally justified. Praise the Lord for His grace!<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

God said in Malachi 3:10 that He would open the windows of blessing for us. &nbsp;Explain how I can get God to open the window of blessing for me.</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Today many false teachers have taught that God&#39;s word teaches that believers should expect great material and financial blessing, and these false teachers often turn to passages like Malachi 3 to support their twisted claims. While it is true that God is loving and caring for His children, it is NOT true that He promises to bring great riches and an abundance of material blessings to believers.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding Malachi 3:10, the Lord was speaking specifically to the nation of Israel in this verse concerning their sin under the Old Covenant. The Old Covenant was given to Israel through Moses, and the Law required Israel to contribute tithes to the temple in support of the Levitical priests.&nbsp; In Malachi&#39;s day, the nation of Israel had forsaken the covenant and was no longer tithing as required by their Law.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsequently, the Lord told the nation they must bring the missing tithes to the temple or else the Lord will bring curses against Israel.&nbsp; The says:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMal. 3:8&nbsp; &ldquo;Will a man&nbsp; rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you say, &lsquo;How have we robbed You?&rsquo; In&nbsp; tithes and&nbsp; offerings.<br />\n\tMal. 3:9 &ldquo;You are&nbsp; cursed with a curse, for you are&nbsp; robbing Me, the whole nation of you!<br />\n\tMal. 3:10 &ldquo; Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be&nbsp; food in My house, and test Me now in this,&rdquo; says the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;if I will not&nbsp; open for you the windows of heaven and&nbsp; pour out for you a blessing until&nbsp;&nbsp; it overflows.<br />\n\tMal. 3:11 &ldquo;Then I will rebuke the&nbsp; devourer for you, so that it will not&nbsp; destroy the fruits of the ground; nor will your vine in the field cast its grapes,&rdquo; says the LORD of hosts.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tGod offered to bless the nation for their obedience to the covenant, but if they did not obey the covenant, they would be cursed instead. &nbsp;If someone teaches that God intends to bless Gentiles with great material rewards on the same basis, then why don&#39;t they also teach that Gentiles will receive the curses for failing to keep the Law? In reality, both claims are false: believers are not promised the blessing nor the curses of the Old Covenant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tToday as Christians, we are not bound by the Old Covenant nor are we commanded to follow the Law:</p>\n<h5>\n\tGal. 5:18 But if you are&nbsp; led by the Spirit,&nbsp; you are not under the Law.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tIsrael is bound by their covenant, and the tithe is a specific requirement in the Bible for Israel to observe in support of the Jewish temple and the Levitical priests.&nbsp; There is no requirement for Christians to tithe, and since Christians are not bound by the Law of Moses, we have no requirement to give tithes.&nbsp; We are expected to support the work of the Lord as we are led by the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; You can read more about the true Biblical perspective on tithes the article <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/how_much_do_i_have_to_tithe/\"><strong>\"How much do I have to tithe?\"</strong></a></p>\n<p>\n\tGenerally, any teaching that focuses on prosperity and material \"blessing\" from God are false and should be avoided along with the men who deliver these false messages.&nbsp; We recommend you listen to the <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_sovereignty_of_god/\"><strong>Sovereignty of God</strong></a> teaching series to learn more about this dangerous and unbiblical teaching</p>"

They are different identities.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Lord refers to Israel as the wife of the Lord:</p>\n<h5>\n\tIs. 54:6 &ldquo;For the LORD has called you,<br />\n\tLike a wife&nbsp; forsaken and grieved in spirit,<br />\n\tEven like a wife of one&rsquo;s youth when she is rejected,&rdquo;<br />\n\tSays your God.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, the Church is called the Bride of Christ:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRev. 19:7 &ldquo;Let us rejoice and be glad and&nbsp; give the glory to Him, for&nbsp; the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThough these two references are similar, they are not the same.&nbsp; In scripture the wife of the Lord is consistently a reference to the nation of Israel only. The Church is never called a \"wife.\" &nbsp;On the other hand, the Bride of Christ (or just bride) is always used in reference to the (primarily Gentile) Church of the New Testament. These are the ones who have been called into faith since Pentecost and remain until the Church is removed from the earth at the Resurrection.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese two references reflect the two-part nature of God&#39;s plan of redemption for the world. Salvation comes to the Jew first, but the Gentiles are also given opportunity through their association with Israel and the promises made to that nation. Both groups are \"wedded\" to the Lord in that both are included in a single covenant given to Abraham and fulfilled in Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/isaiah/\">Isaiah study</a></strong>&nbsp;provides a complete and detailed explanation on the relationship between Israel and the Church.</p>"

Each teacher spends many hours in daily personal study of Scripture, in learning the accepted techniques for proper interpretation of Biblical texts in context, and in the construction and delivery of teaching (e.g., hermeneutics, homiletics, language studies, church history, etc.).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery VBVM teacher&#39;s training is forever ongoing, as we believe teachers of God&#39;s word are students themselves, therefore they must remaining teachable by the Spirit and accountable to their peers.&nbsp; In fact, all VBVM teachers are expected to spend significant time in preparation for each teaching, averaging a 6:1 ratio of preparation time to delivery time. All teaching is reviewed by Board members, and teachers are corrected as needed to ensure a consistent and accurate library of teaching.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, our ministry prefers to minimize the personal attention and recognition given to the men and women delivering our teaching material. While they deserve credit for their hard work in dividing the word rightly, they prefer to receive that credit in the moment of their judgment before the Lord rather from the praises of men.&nbsp; As Jesus Himself taught:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLuke 17:10 &ldquo;So you too, when you do all the things which are commanded you, say, &lsquo;We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<strong><em>Q. When does the war of Ezekiel 38-39 take place in history?</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The war described in Ezekiel 38-39 is a war prosecuted by Gentiles nations, led by a mysterious ruler, against Israel and Jerusalem. From the details given in Ezekiel, we can attempt to place the war in the overall timeline of eschatology.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, notice the following verses:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEzek. 38:8 &ldquo;After many days you will be summoned; in the latter years you will come into the land that is restored from the sword, whose inhabitants have been&nbsp; gathered from many&nbsp; nations to the&nbsp; mountains of Israel which had been a continual waste; but&nbsp; its people were brought out from the&nbsp; nations, and they are&nbsp; living securely, all of them.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tFrom these few details, we can draw some initial conclusions:</p>\n<p>\n\t1. The events of this war take place in the latter years, after many days.<br />\n\t2. They come against an Israel which has been \"restored from the sword.\" To be restored from the sword means literally to have turn back from or to have repented from the weapons of war. This suggests that Israel has no war implements or armies with which to defend itself.&nbsp; The nation is only prepared for peaceful existence.<br />\n\t3. They live securely, at rest and without walls and defenses, presumably because they have no need for such things given #2 above.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese details combine to suggest an Israel unlike the one of our present age. This war will come upon an Israel that has repented of war and weapons, is peaceful, secure and at rest with the world of nations.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext we read:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEzek. 38:11 and you will say, &lsquo;I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will go against those who are at rest, that live securely, all of them living without walls and having no bars or gates,<br />\n\tEzek. 38:12 to capture spoil and to seize plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places which are now inhabited, and against the people who are gathered from the nations, who have acquired cattle and goods, who live at the&nbsp; center of the world.&rsquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tFrom this passage we learn the attacking forces come upon a nation of Israel that is living at the \"center of the world.\" The Hebrew word for center means \"highest point\" or the heart of the world. This description is not accurate for the Israel of today.&nbsp; Though Jews have always perceived Israel as the center of the word, the Gentile nations do not grant Israel this status.&nbsp; However, in the time of this war, the Gentiles nations themselves will acknowledge that the Jews live at the heart of the world. Again, this is not an accurate depiction of the world we know today.</p>\n<p>\n\tThough these two passages do not describe the present-day Israel, they <em>do</em> match Old Testament descriptions of the Israel of the Millennial Kingdom:</p>\n<h5>\n\tIs. 2:2 &nbsp;Now it will come about that<br />\n\tIn the last days<br />\n\tThe&nbsp; mountain of the house of the LORD<br />\n\tWill be established&nbsp; as the chief of the mountains,<br />\n\tAnd will be raised above the hills;<br />\n\tAnd&nbsp; all the nations will stream to it.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIs. 2:3 And many peoples will come and say,<br />\n\t&ldquo;Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,<br />\n\tTo the house of the God of Jacob;<br />\n\tThat He may teach us&nbsp; concerning His ways<br />\n\tAnd that we may walk in His paths.&rdquo;<br />\n\tFor the&nbsp; law will go forth&nbsp; from Zion<br />\n\tAnd the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tIs. 2:4 And He will judge between the nations,<br />\n\tAnd will&nbsp; render decisions for many peoples;<br />\n\tAnd&nbsp; they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.<br />\n\tNation will not lift up sword against nation,<br />\n\tAnd never again will they learn war.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tNotice that the Israel of the future will (once again) become the dwelling place for the Lord, for He will be literally dwelling among His people in Jerusalem.&nbsp; Because of the Lord&#39;s presence in the city, the nation of Israel and the city of Jerusalem will see its geography altered so that Israel is raised above all the hills of the Earth. Ezekiel also describes the Jerusalem of the Millennial Kingdom as a city occupying the highest mountain top in the world (Ezek 20:40; 37:21-23; 40:2; 43:12), and Isaiah says this results in all nations streaming to it. Finally Isaiah says the Lord will judge among the nations in perfect righteousness, rendering the implements of war unneeded.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese descriptions match the descriptions given in Ezekiel 38-39.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, though the nations of the earth will no longer learn war (literally: train for war), the Enemy nevertheless will cause a final war to take place, according to Revelation 20:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRev. 20:7 &nbsp;When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison,<br />\n\tRev. 20:8 and will come out to&nbsp; deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth,&nbsp; Gog and Magog, to&nbsp; gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the&nbsp; sand of the&nbsp; seashore.<br />\n\tRev. 20:9 And they&nbsp; came up on the&nbsp; broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the&nbsp; beloved city, and&nbsp; fire came down from heaven and devoured them.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThis description also matches another passage from Ezekiel 38, describing the conclusion to this war:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEzek. 38:21 &ldquo;I will call for a&nbsp; sword against&nbsp; him on all My mountains,&rdquo; declares the Lord GOD. &ldquo; Every man&rsquo;s sword will be against his brother.<br />\n\tEzek. 38:22 &ldquo;With pestilence and with blood I will enter into&nbsp; judgment with him; and I will rain on him and on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him,&nbsp; a torrential rain, with&nbsp; hailstones, fire and brimstone.<br />\n\tEzek. 38:23 &ldquo;I will magnify Myself, sanctify Myself, and&nbsp; make Myself known in the sight of many nations; and they will know that I am the LORD.&rdquo;&rsquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThe Lord Himself will fight the battle for Israel (since Israel has nor war implements), and He destroys the invading army by raining down fire, as Rev 2:9 describes.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, Ezekiel names the participants of this battle:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEzek. 38:2 &ldquo;Son of man, set your face toward&nbsp; Gog of the land of&nbsp; Magog, the&nbsp; prince of&nbsp; Rosh,&nbsp; Meshech and&nbsp; Tubal, and prophesy against him.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThe only other reference to a world leader of the name Gog, from the land of Magog, who fights against the Lord is found in Revelation 20:8, which describes the war that ends the Millennial Kingdom.</p>\n<p>\n\tBased on these facts (and others in Ezekiel 38-39), we believe and teach that this war is the war that will end Christ&#39;s Kingdom. The main argument against this interpretation is where to fit the seven years of burning that Ezekiel says will conclude the war. Pastor Armstrong addresses that objection in the course of our <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/revelation_2011/\">Revelation study</a></strong>, when he teaches on the Kingdom in chapter 20.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<strong><em>Q. I have come to understand the soverignty of God in His predestination of believers, but this understanding leads me to more questions. &nbsp;For example, why are Christians called to evangelize if God is in control of who believes? I know you said believers are rewarded for service, but the Bible tells us that we should serve God with no expectation of reward.</em></strong><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Your experience in coming to understand the sovereignty of God in salvation is certainly not unique. Most commonly, the first question a student asks when introduced to the truth of election is the one you raised: why does God&#39;s call us to evangelize given the reality of God&#39;s election of believers? Furthermore, how do we find motivation to seek the lost if the fate of every person lies in God&#39;s hands?</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, God&#39;s call for men to serve Him in any capacity has never been a matter of God&#39;s need; He doesn&#39;t need our involvement or assistance in any work, including in the work of spreading the Gospel. God is capable of delivering the message of the Gospel to anyone in anyway He desires.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, when God calls upon us to give money to support a church or to lead a Bible study or to evangelize the Gospel to others, He doesn&#39;t make these requests because He depends on our contribution to His work. God owns everything in creation and He is the Teacher of all Truth by His Spirit, and He is the One Who changes hearts and brings faith. What can we add to His work? Nothing.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, God delights to share in His work with us, so that we might gain the blessing of partnering with the Father and growing in our relationship with Him and thereby give Him glory for His work through us. When we obey the Father and join Him in His work, we receive the blessing of maturing in our faith and the encouragement of watching the Father at work through us.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso, Paul tell us that we are working to please a Master Who is prepared to reward us in eternity for our faithful service.&nbsp; Our reward is not based on results - only God gets the credit for results - but it is based on diligence and faithfulness.</p>\n<p>\n\tPastor Armstrong commonly uses the analogy of an Easter Egg hunt to describe the way we should approach evangelism. Like children eager to begin their search in the yard, we should see the world as our opportunity to find \"eggs.\" In any Easter egg hunt, children are confident their father has hidden eggs somewhere in the yard, so they search with enthusiasm and without tiring because they are convinced they will find an egg if only they search long and hard enough. They rush from place to place looking for an egg and hoping to find it before another child gets it first. They know that if they look in one place and find nothing, they must move on to another place because eggs are in the yard somewhere.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, once we understand the sovereignty of God in salvation, we can understand our world as a yard filled with Easter eggs (i.e., the elect who the Father is bringing to faith). The Father is always at working bringing men and women to faith around us everyday, so we should go out into that world confident we will find believers if only we look with enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust as the children don&#39;t produce Easter eggs by their searching, we can&#39;t create believers by ourselves through our evangelizing. We depend upon the Spirit to grant us the success we desire. Nevertheless, the more eagerly we search, the more we will likely \"collect\" &ndash; and at our judgment moment, a full basket of \"eggs\" will be to our blessing.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, we wonder where you came to the belief that believers shouldn&#39;t do anything to serve God with the expectation of a reward? Perhaps you were thinking of this passage where Jesus said:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLuke 17:9 &ldquo;He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were commanded, does he?<br />\n\tLuke 17:10 &ldquo;So you too, when you do all the things which are commanded you, say, &lsquo;We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAssuming this was the passage on your mind, Jesus wasn&#39;t speaking concerning eternal rewards in this passage.&nbsp; Rather, He was speaking of earthly rewards. A believer shouldn&#39;t hold out expectations for earthly reward and honor when serving Jesus, but we can &ndash; and should &ndash; expect reward in eternity.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile certainly the Bible says we are to love the Lord, it ALSO says we are to seek eagerly for His approval and His rewards.&nbsp; Perhaps most famously, Paul says:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Cor. 9:23 I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of it.<br />\n\t1Cor. 9:24&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives&nbsp; the prize?&nbsp; Run in such a way that you may win.<br />\n\t1Cor. 9:25 Everyone who&nbsp; competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable&nbsp; wreath, but we an imperishable.<br />\n\t1Cor. 9:26 Therefore I&nbsp; run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not&nbsp; beating the air;<br />\n\t1Cor. 9:27 but I&nbsp; discipline&nbsp; my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tFrom the context of 1Cor 9 it will be clear that Paul is not describing our salvation, since men do not \"run\" to receive it, not does it require \"self-control\" etc. These references can only describe the rewards that await the believer who serves God earnestly and diligently.&nbsp; Notice that Paul uses terms common to athletes in the Olympic games to describe the attitude of a successful believer: run your race to win the prize.&nbsp; If we are willing to run earthly races to win earthly prizes, Paul says, then surely we should also give our best efforts to serving God so as to win an eternal prize.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is nothing wrong or inappropriate about looking forward to our eternal inheritance and striving to make the most of it. Certainly, this is a strong motivating factor for our obedience to the Lord, and the Gospels are filled with examples of this reward being held out to us as a key motivator.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider Jesus&#39; teaching on reward:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 25:14&nbsp; &ldquo; For it is just like a man&nbsp; about to go on a journey, who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them.<br />\n\tMatt. 25:15 &ldquo;To one he gave five&nbsp;&nbsp; talents, to another, two, and to another, one, each according to his own ability; and he&nbsp; went on his journey.<br />\n\tMatt. 25:16 &ldquo;Immediately the one who had received the five&nbsp; talents went and traded with them, and gained five more talents.<br />\n\tMatt. 25:17 &ldquo;In the same manner the one who had received the two talents gained two more.<br />\n\tMatt. 25:18 &ldquo;But he who received the one talent went away, and dug a hole in the ground and hid his&nbsp; master&rsquo;s money.<br />\n\tMatt. 25:19&nbsp; &ldquo;Now after a long time the master of those slaves&nbsp; came and&nbsp;&nbsp; settled accounts with them.<br />\n\tMatt. 25:20 &ldquo;The one who had received the five&nbsp; talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, &lsquo;Master, you entrusted five talents to me. See, I have gained five more talents.&rsquo;<br />\n\tMatt. 25:21 &ldquo;His master said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and&nbsp; faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will&nbsp; put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your&nbsp; master.&rsquo;<br />\n\tMatt. 25:22&nbsp; &ldquo;Also the one who had received the two&nbsp; talents came up and said, &lsquo;Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have gained two more talents.&rsquo;<br />\n\tMatt. 25:23 &ldquo;His master said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good and&nbsp; faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.&rsquo;<br />\n\tMatt. 25:24 &ldquo;And the one also who had received the one&nbsp; talent came up and said, &lsquo;Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed.<br />\n\tMatt. 25:25 &lsquo;And I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.&rsquo;<br />\n\tMatt. 25:26 &ldquo;But his master answered and said to him, &lsquo;You wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed.<br />\n\tMatt. 25:27 &lsquo;Then you ought to have put my money&nbsp; in the bank, and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest.<br />\n\tMatt. 25:28 &lsquo;Therefore take away the talent from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.&rsquo;<br />\n\tMatt. 25:29&nbsp; &ldquo; For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.</h5>"

I wonder if you&#39;re teaching church traditions or the truth?<br />\n\t&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tA. Anytime we teach from the Bible, we take great care to distinguish between the traditions of men and the doctrines of God as revealed in His word. Jesus Himself condemned those who would teach the traditions of men as Biblical truth. Jesus said:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 15:7 &ldquo;You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you:<br />\n\tMatt. 15:8 &lsquo; THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS,<br />\n\tBUT THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME.<br />\n\tMatt. 15:9 &lsquo;BUT IN VAIN DO THEY WORSHIP ME,<br />\n\tTEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAny time a teacher presents the traditions of men in place of the doctrines of God, they are in teaching error and mishandling the word of God. These teachers are far from God, as Isaiah said. Our ministry works hard to teach the doctrines of God as presented in God&#39;s word, and we reject any teaching that is tradition only and not according to Scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, truth never changes, so we should expect sound Biblical teaching to repeat the same truths consistently. Such consistency does not mean the teaching is based on \"tradition,\" but merely reflects the reality that truth never changes. Consequently, if after centuries of consistent teaching concerning a given point in Scripture a&nbsp;new and different intrerpretation emerges, we should evaluate this \"new\" interpretation skeptically, testing it against Scripture before accepting it in place of the time-honored interpretation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes a new interpretation will be correct, reflecting the Spirit&#39;s work to open eyes and correct men&#39;s understanding (e.g., as the Spirit accomplished with Martin Luther during the Reformation), but other times these novel interpretations are deceptive shemes of the enemy to mislead the church into false views of Scripture, and therefore they should be rejected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn our Bible lessons we support our interpretations with careful analysis and exegesis, cross referencing other Scripture and explaining how our view is consistent with the overall teaching of Scripture. We follow well-accepted rules for interpreting the text of Scripture, and we correct or amend our teaching frequently as we discover error or come to a better understanding. We hope our approach gives you confidence that our teaching is consistent with the truth of God&#39;s word.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Why did Jesus cause the fig tree to wither when He knew it was not the season for figs?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The events of the fig tree in Mark 11 are part of a larger narrative and must be understood in context. The context of Mark 11 is Jesus entering Jerusalem shortly before His crucifixion during the week of Passover. The nation of Israel had been offered the opportunity to receive their Messiah and enter into the promised Kingdom, but they rejected Jesus and now they were about to kill their Messiah.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn place of faith, the nation was displaying hypocrisy and unbelief, so in his chapter Mark records Jesus entering Jerusalem and the temple only to find sin and unbelief rather than prayer and faith. The temple gave the appearance of holiness within Israel, but it was merely an illusion and hypocrisy.<img alt=\"Fig Tree\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/HW-12-HTu-01.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; float: right; width: 240px; height: 240px; \" /></p>\n<p>\n\tSo, as Jesus entered into the city, He chose to use His encounter with the fig tree as an opportunity to teach the disciples a lesson concerning the future judgment coming for this unbelieving generation of Israel by the power of God.</p>\n<h5>\n\tMark 11:12 On the next day, when they had left Bethany, He became hungry.<br />\n\tMark 11:13 Seeing at a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it; and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.<br />\n\tMark 11:14 He said to it, &ldquo;May no one ever eat fruit from you again!&rdquo; And His disciples were listening.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAs Jesus approaches the fig tree the first time, Mark says Jesus was hungry and looking for fruit on the tree. The tree had leaves, indicating that it was ready to produce fruit, but Jesus finds none. Importantly, Mark notes that this was not the season for figs, so it was not surprising that the tree was without fruit. Jesus then declares that this tree will never again produce fruit.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt first glance, we might assume that Jesus&#39; response to the tree for failing to produce fruit out of season was unfair and even spiteful, however Mark informed his readers that this was not the season for figs to preclude that conclusion. Jesus knew the tree wouldn&#39;t have fruit, so He must have orchestrated this moment to teach His disciples a lesson.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus statements to the tree were a demonstration conducted for the sake of the disciples to teach a spiritual truth concerning the generation of Israel who had rejected His claims to be Messiah. Israel is often pictured in Scripture as a fig tree, and this tree becomes a picture of the generation of Israel in Jesus&#39; day who rejected His clam to be Messiah. Though this generation in Israel gave an outward appearance of piety and religious belief (just as the tree appeared to be in season for fruit), in reality Israel was producing no spiritual fruit by their unwillingness to believe in the Messiah they claimed to seek.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, Jesus condemned the fruitless tree as an picture of what would happen to this unbelieving generation of Israel. If the Lord was willing to condemn a fruit tree for failing to produce fruit out of season, how much more will He bring judgment against Israel for failing to show spiritual fruit in the face of clear evidence that Jesus was the Messiah? Jesus Himself says He will judge the generation of Israel that rejected Him by condemning it greatly:</p>\n<h5>\n\tLuke 11:49 &ldquo;For this reason also the wisdom of God said, &lsquo; I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and some they will persecute,<br />\n\tLuke 11:50 so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,<br />\n\tLuke 11:51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the house of God; yes, I tell you, it shall be charged against this generation.&rsquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tBefore returning to the tree, Mark records Jesus&#39; experiences in the temple. Jesus chastised the money changers and reminded Israel that God&#39;s House was to be a house of prayer not a den of theives. Mark&#39;s account reinforces for the reader how evil was this generation and how hypocritical was Israel.</p>\n<h5>\n\tMark 11:15 Then they came to Jerusalem. And He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves;<br />\n\tMark 11:16 and He would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.<br />\n\tMark 11:17 And He began to teach and say to them, &ldquo;Is it not written, &lsquo; MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL THE NATIONS&rsquo;? But you have made it a ROBBERS&rsquo; DEN.&rdquo;<br />\n\tMark 11:18 The chief priests and the scribes heard this, and began seeking how to destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, for the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe judgment Jesus promised for this generation is pictured by His second encounter with the fig tree:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMark 11:19 When evening came, they would go out of the city.<br />\n\tMark 11:20 As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up.<br />\n\tMark 11:21 Being reminded, Peter said to Him, &ldquo; Rabbi, look, the fig tree which You cursed has withered.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tWhen Jesus visits the fig tree a second time, the tree is withering starting from the roots. Jesus&#39; condemnation of the tree initiated a slow dying process starting at the roots, the tree&#39;s source of nourishment. As the tree lost nourishment from the roots in the ground, it began to die in keeping with Jesus&#39; words.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe withering tree completes Jesus&#39; picture of Israel. Israel would suffer judgment in the same way the tree withered: from the roots up, so to speak. Jesus&#39; condemnation would result in a gradual withering of this generation in Israel by the cutting off of all spiritual nourishment from God. In the Luke 11 passage quoted above, Jesus said this generation of Israel would reject the word of God delivered by the prophets and apostles sent to her. Since spiritual nourishment is found in the word of God (Matthew 4:4), this generation would be spiritually starved by their rejection of the Gospel. Eventually, this generation would suffer physical judgment when the city of Jerusalem was destroyed in AD 70.</p>\n<h5>\n\tMark 11:22 And Jesus answered saying to them, &ldquo; Have faith in God.<br />\n\tMark 11:23 &ldquo; Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, &lsquo;Be taken up and cast into the sea,&rsquo; and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is going to happen, it will be granted him.<br />\n\tMark 11:24 &ldquo;Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tUpon seeing the withered tree, the disciples exclaimed that that the tree was dying. Their exclamation carried a tone of disbelief, which led Jesus to launch into a teaching on the power of prayer. When the disciples pray in God&#39;s will, Jesus taught they are praying with the power of God. When Jesus spoke his words of condemnation to the tree, His words had the power to wither the tree because they were consistent with God&#39;s will. Jesus incarnate as man understood the Father&#39;s will through the Spirit, just as all men can, only Jesus&#39; understanding was perfect, so His prayers had great power to effect change.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus taught the disciples that their ability to see great things happen from their prayers was a matter of being confident of God&#39;s will beforehand, and when we pray in God&#39;s will, we will see God&#39;s power at work in the result.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I heard a sermon explaining why we should follow the Ten Commandments and keep the Sabbath day on Saturday, but then I heard other teaching that said the New Testament changed the Sabbath to Sunday. &nbsp;These different teachings are confusing me. &nbsp;Please help.</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Confusing and contradictory Bible teaching is nothing new, unfortunately. Since the beginning of the Church, false teaching and ignorance have produced confusion and disagreements within the Body of Christ. Today, we can find denominations and schools of teaching for every conceivable view under the sun, and yet the true source of truth, God&#39;s word, remains unchanged.&nbsp;Verse By Verse Ministry is working to teach God&#39;s word in a methodical and consistent way so that the truth would be revealed and false teaching would be countered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding the teaching of the Sabbath, the Jewish Sabbath is observed from sundown Friday until sundown Saturday each week. Jews also used the Sabbath day as their worship day in the synagogue. In New Testament times, the early Church often met for worship on Sundays, in honor of Christ&#39;s resurrection which occured on a Sunday. Secondly, the early church was largely Jewish and sometimes met in synagogues. &nbsp;Since the Jewish synagogues were in use on Saturdays for Jewish worship, Christians moved their day of worship to Sunday.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo which day is the correct Sabbath day? For a Jew, the Sabbath day is Saturday, as it has been from the beginning. For a Christian, the traditional worship day has become Sunday, though there is no Biblical requirement to worship on a particular day of the week. &nbsp;More importantly, a day of worship and a Sabbath day are not the same thing. While the Bible teaches that Christians are to participate in regular corporate worship (see Hebrews 10:25), it also teaches that Christians are not under obligation to observe <u>any</u> Sabbath day.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Sabbath day was given to Israel as part of the Law of Moses. You can find the Sabbath requirement in the Law in Exodus 20. The Law&nbsp;(including the Sabbath day) was given to Israel to prepare Israel for the Messiah&#39;s eventual arrival.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul teaches in Galatians:</p>\n<h5>\n\tGal. 3:19 Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tEarlier in Galatians Paul taught that the Law was never given as a mean to salvation, since salvation was made possible only through promises extended to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. So now Paul asks why was the Law of Moses given to Israel if not for salvation? Paul answers that the Law was added to the earlier promises given to Abraham because of men&#39;s sin, and the Law would remain in effect until the seed (i.e., the promised Messiah) arrived.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Law was intended to last only until the Messiah came, and it was given during that time to \"keep\" God&#39;s children from sin.&nbsp;Paul goes on to say:</p>\n<h5>\n\tGal. 3:23 But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.<br />\n\tGal. 3:24 Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPaul says before our faith in Messiah came, God&#39;s children were kept under custody by the Law of God. The Law was a tutor teaching men about the coming Messiah until the time the Messiah arrived, thus leading men to recognize and know the Messiah when He was revealed in Jesus Christ. Once the Gospel arrived, the Law relinquished its authority over God&#39;s children, because Christ fulfilled the Law&#39;s requirements on our behalf and by faith we receive credit for Christ&#39;s sinless work. In place of the Law of Moses comes the Law of Christ written on the hearts of believers.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Sabbath is part of the Law of Moses, and therefore like the rest of the Law, the Sabbath&#39;s ultimate purpose was to teach men about the coming Messiah. Specifically, the Sabbath taught a spiritual lesson concerning the relationship between our works and spiritual rest. Under the Law of Moses, men performed physical work six days each week while looking forward to a day of rest each Saturday. But after the Sabbath ended, a new week of work began again. The physical Sabbath rest provided by the Law was temporary and, ultimately, unsatisfying.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis pattern of weekly Sabbaths was a tool God used in the Law to teach men a spiritual truth. The Sabbath reinforced the truth that the work of men isn&#39;t capable of producing permanent rest. Spiritually speaking, men who rely on their own works to merit God&#39;s favor will fall short of securing God&#39;s eternal rest (i.e., heaven).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe writer of the letter to Hebrews explains the connection between the Sabbath rest and our salvation rest this way:</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 4:1 Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.<br />\n\tHeb. 4:2 For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.<br />\n\tHeb. 4:3 For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said,<br />\n\t&ldquo; AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH,<br />\n\tTHEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,&rdquo;<br />\n\talthough His works were finished from the foundation of the world.<br />\n\tHeb. 4:4 For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day: &ldquo; AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS&rdquo;;<br />\n\tHeb. 4:5 and again in this passage, &ldquo; THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tWhen the Jewish people observed the Sabbath each week, they were portraying a spiritual story by God&#39;s design. As they rested from their physical work each Saturday, they produced a picture of how ceasing form human work leads to a resting in God&#39;s work. The picture is of how our by faith in Christ&#39;s work on the cross puts an end to our own efforts to work our way into heaven. Christ&#39;s work leads to our spiritual, eternal rest (our true Sabbath). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe writer of Hebrews says that just as God now sits at rest from His works of Creation, we too may share in His rest when we believe in Christ. In that sense, Christ becomes our Sabbath rest. We rest in Christ&#39;s work by faith and we receive God&#39;s eternal rest of salvation. While the Sabbath day rest offered in the Law of Moses was only earthly and temporary, the Sabbath rest offered by faith in Christ is heavenly and eternal.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe lessor was a picture of the greater, which is why Paul taught that we now have no need to observe the lessor (i.e., the weekly Sabbath rest) since we have already obtained the greater Sabbath in Christ. As Paul said:</p>\n<h5>\n\tCol. 2:16 &nbsp;Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day &mdash;<br />\n\tCol. 2:17 things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ. &nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe weekly Sabbath day was a Law given to Israel to teach men about the need to believe in (i.e., rest in) Messiah.&nbsp;If you have already trusted in Jesus Christ as your savior, then you have already fulfilled the Law of Moses having accomplished its greater purpose, that is to believe in Christ. As a Christian, therefore, you are no longer under the Law of Moses.&nbsp;Just as the rest of the Law is no longer in effect for believers, likewise the Sabbath (which is part of the Law) is no longer a requirement for believers. As&nbsp;Paul says:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 7:6 But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tGod does not obligate Christians to observe any particular day of rest. We are free to observe a Sabbath day or forego a day of rest altogether. We are no longer under Law; we are under grace!</p>\n<p>\n\tYou can read more about this topic here:</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/how_should_a_christian_approach_the_sabbath/ \"><strong>How Should a Christian Approach the Sabbath?</strong></a></p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/on_law_and_liberty_part_1/\"><strong>On Law and Liberty</strong></a></p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/genesis_2011/genesis_2011_lesson_1d/\"><strong>Lesson 1D of Genesis</strong></a><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. In 2Samuel 24 and 1Chronicles 21, I find conflicting accounts of the story of David numbering his troops. Did the Lord decree three years of famine or seven years of famine for David&#39;s sin?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. In 2Samuel 24 and in 1Chronicles 21, we&#39;re told that David sinned by numbering his forces against God&#39;s wishes. In response to David&#39;s sin, the Lord offers David a choice of how he would be punished. As you pointed out, the possible punishments recorded in these two accounts differ. In 2Samuel 24, David is offered seven years of famine while in 1Chronicles 21 David is offered three years of famine. Is this a contradiciton?</p>\n<p>\n\tIn reality, both of these statements are correct. In the account recorded in 2Samuel, the writer informs us in an earlier chapter (Chapter 21) that the land of Israel had already experienced three years of a famine before David committed his sin:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Sam. 21:1 Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David sought the presence of the LORD. And the LORD said, &ldquo;It is for Saul and his bloody house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAs we reach chapter 24 of 2Samuel, David sins by sending Joab throughout the land of Israel to count the number of David&#39;s forces. The counting takes more than nine months, according to 2Samuel 24:8, which means the famine is now approaching the fourth year. This is the moment when God offers David a choice of punishment for his sin. In 2Samuel 24, the punishment is recorded as seven years, while in 1Chronicles 21 the punishment is described as three years.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the writer of 2Samuel has already informed his readers of the ongoing four-year famine, he described David&#39;s punishment as seven years of famine, since this punishment would have added three more years to the four years already past. The writer wanted his readers to understand that had David chosen this option, he would have burdened the people of Israel with a total of seven years of famine.</p>\n<p>\n\tTurning to the same account recorded in 1Chronicles, we find no mention of the ongoing four years of famine in the land prior to David&#39;s sin. Since the author of 1Chronicles had never mentioned this detail, he recorded the length of David&#39;s punishment as three years of famine.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo were there seven years of famine or only three? The answer is BOTH. Had David chosen this option, there would have been seven years of famine altogether in Israel, because four years had already occurred, and the punishment offered to David was three additional years of famine.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. I&#39;m confused what the Bible says about where a Christian or unbeliever goes when they die. Do we go directly to heaven (or hell)? If so, what about the story of Lazarus and the Rich Man? And how does the Rapture fit in?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The experience of death differs&nbsp;depending on whether&nbsp;a person is a saint (i.e., saved by faith in the Lord) or&nbsp;an unbeliever and when the person lived.</p>\n\n<p>For all humanity, the Bible teaches that when a&nbsp;person&#39;s&nbsp;body dies, the body returns to dust. The human body grows old and dies because of the curse God pronounced on the earth following Adam&#39;s sin in Genesis 3. The material God used to construct the human body came \"from the ground,\" according to Genesis 2, therefore, the curse on the earth also condemned&nbsp;the human body to die, since the body is part of the earth. As the earth goes, so goes our physical body. (To learn more about this principle, please listen to our <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis study</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>While the body is temporary, a human spirit (also called the soul) is eternal. A human spirit exists forever and is always conscious. Our spirit is never \"asleep\" (as some teach incorrectly) and it was designed to exist within a physical body. Therefore, after a person&#39;s body dies, the person&#39;s spirit will exist somewhere in full consciousness yet without a body until a future day of resurrection, when God gives each spirit a new, permanent body.</p>\n\n<p>At the point of death, a person&#39;s spirit will experience different outcomes&nbsp;depending on whether the person was a saint (i.e., a believer) and depending when they lived in history.</p>\n\n<p>For the Christian who dies today, his or her spirit&nbsp;moves directly from the body at the moment of death into Christ&#39;s presence in the Heavenly throne room escorted by angels, according to Jesus in Luke 16. As Paul explains:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 5:4 For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life.<br />\n2Cor. 5:5 Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge.<br />\n2Cor. 5:6 Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord &mdash;<br />\n2Cor. 5:7 for we walk by faith, not by sight &mdash;<br />\n2Cor. 5:8 we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.<br />\n2Cor. 5:9 Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him.</h5>\n\n<p>Our physical body is the material, temporary part of our existence, so Paul says it is only a temporary home for our spirit, which is the eternal part of us. Our spirit occupies our body for a time, but when our body dies, our spirit moves to our next home to be present with the Lord (if we are a believer) into the throne room of God.</p>\n\n<p>Paul goes on in 2Corinthians to tell us more about that moment:</p>\n\n<h5>2Cor. 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</h5>\n\n<p>After our physical body dies, Paul says we appear before the judgment seat of the Lord in spirit form to receive our rewards for service to the Lord.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Jesus&#39; death and resurrection, the process for a saint operated&nbsp;differently.&nbsp;A story told by Jesus in Luke 16 give us the definitive Biblical&nbsp;account of life after death prior to the resurrection of the Messiah.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Christ&#39;s death and resurrection, the souls of Old Testament saints could not go directly to&nbsp;heaven at the moment of death, since the atonement of Christ had yet to be made on the cross. Though these saints were saved by their faith, the sacrifice to cleanse their sin had not yet been made by Christ. Because of their faith they were not due to receive a penalty for their sin, but because Christ had not yet died for them, they had not yet been cleansed from sin.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, God made a special provision for these Old Testament saints in the time before Christ. God held the souls of saints in a place of comfort, euphemistically called Abraham&#39;s Bosom, where they were waiting until Christ&#39;s appearing. Abraham&#39;s Bosom was the \"good\" side of a place called Sheol in the Old Testament. Sheol also held a side of torment called Hades, from which we get the word Hell. Abraham&#39;s Bosom and Hades existed side-by-side in Sheol until the time of Jesus&#39; appearing in the first century.</p>\n\n<p>After Christ&#39;s crucifixion, He descended into the earth following His death. There He preached to the OT saints waiting in Abraham&#39;s Bosom. Like Jesus introduced Himself as the Messiah these saints anticipated in faith, and He explained the Lord&#39;s plan of salvation. At the conclusion of three days time, Jesus ascended into Heaven, and He set these saints free from this place of waiting by escorting them directly into Heaven, as Paul and Peter explain:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 4:8&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it says,<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;When He ascended on high,<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He led captive a host of captives,<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And He gave gifts to men.&rdquo;<br />\nEph. 4:9 (Now this expression, &ldquo;He ascended,&rdquo; what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?<br />\nEph. 4:10 He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)</h5>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 4:6 For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God.</h5>\n\n<h5>1Pet. 3:18 For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;<br />\n1Pet. 3:19 in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison,</h5>\n\n<p>Today, Abraham&#39;s Bosom stands empty, since the spirits of dead New Testament saints may enter directly into Heaven. By the start of Christ&#39;s thousand-year Kingdom on earth, all saints (both Old and New Testament believers) will have received new physical bodies as part of the First Resurrection, according to Revelation 20, and all will live eternally with Christ in their new bodies.</p>\n\n<p>The Church saints are resurrected at the Rapture, which is the modern name&nbsp;given to the moment Paul described in&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/first_corinthians/first_corinthians_lesson_14/\">1Corinthians 15</a>,</strong>&nbsp;when the Church saints who have died (and are present in spirit&nbsp;with Christ in Heaven) receive new physical bodies followed by those Church saints still alive on the earth. The Old Testament saints are resurrected at the conclusion of the Tribulation, according to Daniel 12. Then all saints enter the Kingdom together in new eternal bodies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the destination for unbelievers in death is very different. Hades is still occupied and its numbers grow by the hour. Every unbeliever who dies is&nbsp;separated, soul from body, and the spirit enters Hades where they await their day of judgment. Hades is under our feet in the center of the earth, according to the Bible, and the spirits of all unbelievers go to this place regardless of when they died in history. They suffer in torment day and night, according to the Bible, yet Hades is not their final abode.</p>\n\n<p>A final, future judgment&nbsp;called the Great White Throne Judgment&nbsp;awaits all unbelievers at the conclusion of the thousand-year Kingdom on earth, according to Revelation 20. At the start of this judgment, all unbelievers are removed from Hades and&nbsp;given new physical bodies in the Second Resurrection, according to Revelation 20. At this judgment, these will be condemned to the \"second death,\" which is the Bible&#39;s term for an eternal existence in the Lake of Fire.</p>\n\n<p>For a complete teaching on Sheol and the story in Luke 16, please listen to&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_book_of_luke/luke_lesson_16b/\">Lesson 16B</a></strong> from our Gospel of Luke study.</p>\n\n<p>For a complete teaching on the Rapture, please read the following <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/how_do_we_know_there_will_be_a_rapture/\"><strong>article</strong></a>.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. I suspect that one of the pastors in my church is homosexual. He has homosexual mannerisms by the way he talks and acts, which has caused me to suspect his is a homosexual. &nbsp;I don&#39;t want to remain in a church that allows homosexual ministers. &nbsp;I have considered confronting him, but I&#39;m not sure what to do.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. In answering your question, we must address two separate issues. First,&nbsp;we must address misconceptions concerning the nature of homosexuality itself. In our culture homosexuality has become associated with a collection of behaviors, lifestyle choices and mannerisms, yet we must separate innocent mannerisms from homosexuality&#39;s true offense. The Bible&#39;s objection to homosexuality is focused on inappropriate sexual behaviors (and associated lustful thoughts).</p>\n\n<p>According to Scripture, the only sexual conduct acceptable to God is between a man and woman in the context of a marriage. Therefore, sexual behavior (or lustful thoughts) between two men or two women is immoral and sinful. If your worship leader is engaging in such behavior, he is sinning according to Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, homosexual mannerisms are not sinful by themselves. Vocal patterns, hand gestures, and other non-sexual behaviors commonly associated with homosexuality (or even maintaining a single lifestyle, sharing a home with a male roommate in a plutonic relationship, etc.) are not sinful by themselves. Men who lack a desire for female companionship or who prefer male companionship do not sin unless they act upon those desires in a sinful way, whether by entertaining sexual lusts or engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, a godly heterosexual man may posses mannerisms and speech patterns associated with homosexuality without engaging in homosexual lust or sexual contact. Stereotypical mannerisms tell us nothing about a man&#39;s sexual life, and they say even less about the nature of his heart. The mere presence of homosexual \"indicators\" do not constitute proof of sinful sexual behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, you may suspect your worship leader is engaged in sinful practices, but unless you have specific knowledge, you have no basis to judge him much less to act against him. This is precisely why Scripture calls for \"two witnesses\" against an accused (see Deut 17:6; Matt 18:16). The Biblical requirement for two persons who agree in making an accusation is intended to reduce the possibility of false accusations and personal slander, in accordance with 1Tim 5:13.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the BIble gives us clear direction for how to respond should we come to know of sin within the church body. &nbsp;If you discover that a pastor is sinning, you should not leave the church; you should follow Matthew 18:15-17:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Matt. 18:15 &ldquo;If your brother sins , go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother.<br />\nMatt. 18:16 &ldquo;But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES EVERY FACT MAY BE CONFIRMED.<br />\nMatt. 18:17 &ldquo;If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>We can assure you that every member of your pastoral staff is engaged in some sin, because pastors are people and will sin just as we all do. This fact, however, isn&#39;t cause for separating from a church body. If the presence of sin in your pastor&#39;s life were justification for leaving a church, no one could ever participate in any church! Instead, Jesus taught we have an obligation to correct sin in the body, so even if a Pastor is found engaged in homosexual sin, we have a Biblical obligation to help correct the behavior, not run from it.</p>\n\n<p>According to Jesus in Matthew 18, the Biblical response when we discover sin in the life of a fellow believer (whether a pastor or anyone else) is to go to the person privately with your knowledge of their sin. If he listens to you, then you have won your brother, meaning you have brought him out of sin and helped him live a more pleasing life to the Lord. If he refuses to address your concerns, then you seek others in the church who share your viewpoint. If you are unable to find allies, then accept this as a sign from the Lord and cease pursuing the matter. On the other hand, if you find others in the Body who agree with your concerns, then go with them to confront the individual again and seek reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>If the person repents showing fruit of repentance, he should be welcomed into fellowship.&nbsp;On the other hand, if the person remains unrepentant and unwilling to address the issue, the church has an obligation to set that person outside fellowship, as Jesus commanded. To be clear, the person is not dismissed from fellowship because they engaged in sin. We don&#39;t send brothers or sisters away simply because they sin (otherwise we could have no fellowship at all!); rather, they&nbsp;are dismissed from fellowship because they were unrepentant and unwilling to accept the correction of the church body, as Jesus taught in Matthew 18:17.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of an elder, pastor,&nbsp;teacher or other leader accused of serious immorailty, the church must also consider their fitness to serve in their leadership role.&nbsp;Even if the person repents of their sin after being confronted by the church, the church would be wise to remove them from any leadership or teaching role, since the Biblical character tests for leaders are stricter. Neverthless, they could maintain fellowship in the body if they accept the correction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if your church leadership is made aware of a church member or leader who is engaging in unrepentant sin and yet the leadership is unwilling to confront the individual and apply the discipline required in Matthew 18, then you might reconsider your association with that fellowship. There is no Biblical requirement that you depart the fellowship over such an incident, but&nbsp;undoubtedly&nbsp;you will find it difficult to accept the leadership of a sinning pastor, and therefore true fellowship is likely to be difficult.</p>\n\n<p>As a final note, we broadened our answer to your question to address all types of sin and all church members regardless of role because the nature of a person&#39;s sin and their role in the congregation have no bearing on our response to sin, according to Matthew 18. We should respond in the same, consistent manner anytime we learn of sin in the body of Christ.</p>"

In Hebrews, you explained chapter 10:26-29 as spoken to an unbeliever, while in James 2 you explain the same Hebrews passage was speaking to believers. Isn&#39;t that a contradiction?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. All our teachers are also students of Scripture. Like every Bible student, they continue to be taught by the Holy Spirit even as they work to divide rightly the Word of God and share their insights with others. Consequently, all our teachers will adjust their understanding of Scripture from time to time as they continue to grow and deepen in fellowship with the Lord through His word.</p>\n\n<p>As you pointed out, our teaching of Hebrews 10 has changed over time. Specifically, we taught the warning in Hebrews 10 was intended for unbelievers (during our Hebrews class), but later we taught that the warning was speaking to believers (during our James study). This progression in views is an example of how a Bible student&#39;s knowledge of Scripture will continue to grow as we are exposed to more of God&#39;s word and the Spirit matures our understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In short, the correct interpretation of the Hebrews 10 passage can be found in our James 2 teaching, NOT in our Hebrews study. The writer issued a warning to believers who had retreated from their confession and walk with Christ reminding them that they risked receiving a bad judgment from the Lord. This judgment refers to the Judgment Seat of Christ, where all believers may receive some measure of rewards for good and faithful service to Christ. The warning does not speak of eternal damnation, but rather of receiving the displeasure of a demanding Master.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Hebrews 10, many students have experienced this same switching of viewpoints regarding the intended audience. In our case, our clearer understanding of Hebrews 10 didn&#39;t arrive until our James study illuminated our error and caused us to rethink our views of the Hebrews 10 passsage. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Though we regret the potential confusion cause by publishing two studies with conflicting views on this passage, our ministry leadership decided to leave both teachings available on our website as an example to every Bible student of how the Spirit will grow our understanding of Scripture over time. Every teacher must remain teachable, because even teachers and pastors have error in their understanding of Scripture. &nbsp;If we aren&#39;t willing to change our views of Scripture in response to the Spirit, then how can we expect our students will do the same?</p>\n\n<p>Though we taught Hebrews 10:26-29&nbsp;in error at that earlier time, nevertheless the Lord was kind to bring us to a better understanding later, so we could ultimately share the proper teaching with our listeners. We believe this example is a useful testimony, but should we have an opportunity to re-record Hebrews in the future, we will teach chapter 10 properly and eliminate the contradiction. Until then, the contradiction stands as a testimony to the Spirit&#39;s faithfulness to correct our mistakes and grow our understanding.</p>"

Where did we go after the Rapture?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. We know that the Church Age ends at the conclusion of chapter 3 of Revelation, and the next scene (in chapter 4) shows the Church in residing in the throne room of Heaven following the Rapture. We know the Church saints are present because the Seven Spirits of God are in the Throne room and because the 24 Elders are present.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, the Seven Spirits of God indicate the entirety of the Holy Spirit is in Heaven, which means that the Church in its entirety must also be in the Throne room, since the Spirit will never leave us nor foresake us (Heb 13:5). Furthermore, the presence of elders indicates that the Church has arrived in Heaven. The term elder in Scripture is always used for human leadership among God&#39;s people, and the description of these elders indicate they are saved by grace (i.e., white robes, crowns).</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if 24 resurrected elders are present in Heaven (i.e., a complete number of elders) and the entirety of the Spirit of God as well, then we must conclude that the entire church is also present. In John&#39;s description of that moment in Revelation 4 &amp; 5, he notes only the Spirit and the elders and he doesn&#39;t specifically mention seeing the Church saints present, but we come to conclude the church WAS present based on the evidence. &nbsp;Therefore, the fact that John doesn&#39;t specifically mention seeing the Church present is of little significance; God may not have permitted John to witness the Church in that moment, but we know from the symolism of the evidence provided that the Church must be present as well.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I noticed that in Matthew 27:9-10 the writer says Jesus&#39; betrayal was the fulfillment of the prophesy in Jeremiah, but the quote in Matthew 27 from the OT is actually from Zachariah. Is there an explanation for this?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Matthew relies on a very common rabbinical technique of combining related prophetic passages to reveal meaning. In the case of Matthew 27, the author is blending Jeremiah 19:1-11 and Zachariah 11. In rabbinical tradition, when teaching from two prophets is blended into a single quote, the greater prophet receives the credit. In this case, Jeremiah is considered to be a greater prophet, so Matthew attributes the prophecy to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, notice that Matthew says the words of Jeremiah were fulfilled by the betrayal of Christ for thirty pieces of silver, yet Matthew quotes words taken from Zechariah 11. It&#39;s important to note that the words quoted from Zechariah do not by themselves pronounce a prophecy as such, but rather they are taken from Zechariah&#39;s story concerning how he shepharded the flocks. His story was a picture of Christ&#39;s betrayal, yet his actual words were not prophetic.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the picture of Christ&#39;s betrayal was provided in Zechariah&#39;s book, but the content of the prophecy concerning God&#39;s judgment of Israel is provided in Jeremiah 19:1-11. Therefore, Matthew says that the events of chapter 27 \"fulfilled\" Jeremiah rather than Zechariah, though he chose Zechariah&#39;s words to draw upon the picture of pottery, a polluted burial place and a rebellious people who treat the Lord with contempt. The fulfillment was of God&#39;s promise to judge Israel and make the land empty and polluted, because Israel rejected God, in the Person of Christ.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Could you explain the proper interpretation of Matthew 7:6? Given the context of the chapter, I believe it is misinterpreted too much.</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Regarding Matthew 7:6, this verse sits in the middle of a three part section of Matthews seventh chapter. In verse 1-5, Jesus explains our obligation toward our brothers and sisters in the Body of Christ. In verses 7-11, Jesus teaches concerning our obligation toward God. In verse 12 Jesus summarizes that we must treat everyone in the way we want to be treated, as Scripture expects.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn between these two sections, Jesus offers a single verse on our obligations to the unbelieving world. Jesus uses dogs and swine as symbols for unbelievers, in that Jews viewed both animals as representative of the unclean Gentile world. Jesus tells the disciples they are not to share what is holy with unbelievers. The question is what was Jesus describing?</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the context of Matthew 7, the likely meaning of what is \"holy\" is Christian fellowship, practice and intimacy within the Body of Christ. Is the same way Paul teaches that darkness and light have nothing in common, Jesus says we must guard our associations and our readiness to incorporate unbelievers in our close relationships. Jesus says \"dogs\" will tear us apart and \"swine\" will trample under the holy and unique experiences of believers, since unbelievers are unable to appreciate such things.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany interpret Jesus statement to include a warning against sharing the Gospel repeatedly with unbelievers who have shown disregard and even hostility toward the truth. This interpretation is also consistent with the overall context of Matthew 7 and is in keeping with the Bible&#39;s general view of evangelism. Faith is a gift (Eph 2:8-9) and God alone creates new faith through the Spirit, so our obligation toward unbelievers should not include an expectation that we can produce a changed heart. Only God can affect such change, so we are to guard against the Good News being treated lightly (i.e., throwing it to dogs and swine).</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, it would be wrong to suggest that Matthew 7:6 relieves Christians from the requirement to share the Gospel or pursue unbelievers. Jesus isn&#39;t suggesting that we shouldn&#39;t try to reach the lost, but He is teaching that our desire to convert should not cause us to press beyond what God permits.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

In this encounter, Jesus exchanges word with a Gentile woman who sought healing for her demon-possessed daughter. Like so many other people of the Galilee and surrounding areas, the woman was drawn by stories of Jesus&#39; amazing healing powers. Unlike most of the women beseeching Jesus for healing, this woman was not a Jew. Nevertheless, she addresses Jesus as the \"Son of David,\" a Messianic term indicating she knew of the promise of a coming Savior for Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe real question for Jesus and for the reader is whether this woman truly believed in the promise of a Messiah, or was she merely repeating His title hoping to impress Him and gain His help?</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus initially remains silent to her request, but soon her requests begin to annoy the disciples and they counsel Jesus to send her away. In response, Jesus says He was only sent to the lost sheep of Israel. At first, Jesus&#39; response seems odd, as if He was answering a different question. In reality, the disciples had been asking Jesus to get rid of the woman by granting her request.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn response to the disciples&#39; request, Jesus responds that His mission was to present Himself as Messiah to the Jewish people. The promise of a coming Messiah was given exclusively to the Jewish people through the words of the Law and the Prophets. As Jesus arrived to fulfill those promises, He correctly reminds the disciples that He was not sent for a mission of healing the sick or dispossessing every demon. Those miracles were merely a means to a greater end, and Jesus&#39; end was to call Israel to follow Him.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsequently, when the Canaanite woman begged Jesus for healing, Jesus felt no obligation to answer her request. Jesus&#39; response was always a matter of choosing to serve the purpose and calling given Him by the Father.</p>\n<p>\n\tUpon hearing Jesus&#39; response, the woman takes a step closer to convincing Jesus of her sincerity in faith by bowing before Him and addressing Him as Lord as she asks again for His healing. Jesus finally speaks to the woman in proverbially terms. Jesus uses a colloquialism of His day to explain His reluctance to respond to her request. Jesus compares His mercy and healing as bread reserved for the members of His family. In contrast to the children of God, Jesus uses a familiar term, dogs, to describe Gentiles.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Paul reminds us in Ephesians:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 2:11 Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called &ldquo; Uncircumcision&rdquo; by the so-called &ldquo; Circumcision,&rdquo; which is performed in the flesh by human hands &mdash;<br />\n\tEph. 2:12 remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe condition of Gentiles prior to the time of Pentecost was to be excluded from the promises of Israel without hope. This is the situation in which this Canaanite woman found herself. So, Jesus provokes her by reminding her that the Messiah was sent for the Jew and had no obligation to the dogs, the Gentiles.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, the woman demonstrates her understanding of - and faith in - God&#39;s promises in His word concerning the fate of Gentiles in relation to the Messiah of Israel. She responds with a proverb of her own reminding Jesus that God promised to bless all nations through His promise to Abraham.</p>\n<p>\n\tConvinced that He was looking at a woman of faith - and therefore a child of God - Jesus responds with mercy and healing for her daughter. Jesus&#39; response was a recognition that the woman had faith not only in Jesus&#39; power to heal, but more importantly she believed in His claim to be the Son of David, the One sent to both Israel and eventually Gentiles to redeem men from their sin.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<strong><em>Q. My husband committed suicide recently. He said his troubles were just too much to live with. He was saved and baptized three years ago, claiming Jesus as his personal Lord and savior. I wonder what his decision to take his own life says about his faith and whether he was truly a Christian? Does the Bible consider suicide to be sin?</em></strong><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Please accept our condolences for the loss of your husband, and we understand how painful his decision to take his own life must have been for you and your family. Obviously, we can&#39;t say whether he was truly a believer, but assuming his confession was genuine, then we can assure you that his actions to take his own life did not invalidate his faith and salvation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the Bible is largely silent on the matter of suicide, it does teach that murder is sin, and suicide is simply another form of murder (we could call it \"self-murder\"). Therefore, suicide is a sin, because when we take any human life (even our own), we are violating God&#39;s command to love and not to murder. We are assuming authority for deciding life or death in place of God Himself.</p>\n<p>\n\tYour husband&#39;s decision to take his own life was self-murder, and therefore it was sin, but any sin - even the sin of self-murder - cannot separate us from the love of God. Paul gives us this assurance most succinctly in Romans 8:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 8:38 For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,<br />\n\tRom. 8:39 nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tAs Paul teaches, not even death (in any form) can separate a Christian from Christ. We are not saved by our \"good works\" because works have no relationship to our salvation. &nbsp;Therefore neither can we be \"unsaved\" by our sinful works, even by an act of murder. Our works simply have no bearing on our relationship to God having come to faith in Christ. As Paul says in Ephesians 2:</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;<br />\n\tEph. 2:9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tYour husband&#39;s faith and salvation were the result of God&#39;s grace and mercy alone, therefore even when we act faithlessly (as your husband did in taking his own life), nevertheless God always acts faithfully for our eternal good, as Paul says:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Tim. 2:13 If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tAlso, our gift of salvation is permanent and irrevocable as Paul teaches in Romans:</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 11:29 for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tPraise be to God that an act of suicide (or self-murder) is not a \"special\" sin or an unforgivable sin for the Christian. Like all sin, self-murder was forgiven us by our faith in Christ&#39;s atoning work on the cross. When your husband came to faith and was baptized, he was sealed by the Holy Spirit and was washed clean of all his sin, both past and future sin. There is no sin too great for Christ&#39;s blood to cover, so even his sin of self-murder was forgiven by God&#39;s grace and the atoning work of Christ, and so upon your husband&#39;s death he entered into Christ&#39;s presence.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. I have always been told that there was an age of accountability in scripture, meaning that children who die before a certain age are automatically saved. I&#39;ve even heard a preacher quote Romans 7:9 saying when we become aware that our sin separates us from God, sin is \"revived\" in us and then we are held accountable to God from that point. Is this viewpoint correct?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Bible never teaches that there is an&nbsp;\"age of accountability.\" The term never appears in the Bible nor does the concept in any form. Furthermore, scripture never suggests that children are born without sin or that they cannot be held accountable for sin because they don&#39;t understand or recognize it.&nbsp;Ironically,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">the Bible teaches exactly the opposite idea:&nbsp;every&nbsp;person is accountable to God for their sin at every age.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For example, Paul teaches:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Eph. 2:1 &nbsp;And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,<br />\nEph. 2:2 &nbsp;in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.<br />\nEph. 2:3 &nbsp;Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>And the Psalmist wrote:</p>\n\n<h6>Psa. 53:1 The fool has said in his heart, &ldquo;There is no God,&rdquo; They are corrupt, and have committed abominable injustice; There is no one who does good.<br />\nPsa. 53:2 God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men To see if there is anyone who understands, Who seeks after God.<br />\nPsa. 53:3 Every one of them has turned aside; together they have become corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>And David testified concerning himself:</p>\n\n<h6>Psa. 51:2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity<br />\nAnd cleanse me from my sin.<br />\n<br />\nPsa. 51:3 For I know my transgressions,<br />\nAnd my sin is ever before me.<br />\n<br />\nPsa. 51:4 Against You, You only, I have sinned<br />\nAnd done what is evil in Your sight,<br />\nSo that You are justified when You speak<br />\nAnd blameless when You judge.<br />\n<br />\nPsa. 51:5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,<br />\nAnd in sin my mother conceived me.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Notice how consistent scripture is on this point. Paul says that unbelievers are deserving God&#39;s wrath by \"nature\" not because they reach a certain age.&nbsp;David says in Psalm 51, he was \"conceived in iniquity,\" meaning he was born with a sin nature from the start. He also said that his sin was ever before him, meaning there was never a time when his sin was not present in his life.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, David declares that God is blameless when He judges us for that sin, because sinful men deserve judgment. There is no escaping the reality of our sin from birth&nbsp;and our accountability before God. Age has nothing to do with it.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Psalmist says in Psalm 53 that no one does good and everyone is evil. Furthermore, when God looks down upon mankind, He finds no exceptions to this rule. No one - no adult nor child - is \"good\" before God. As Jesus Himself said:</span></p>\n\n<h6>Mark 10:18 &ldquo;Why do you call me good?&rdquo; Jesus answered. &ldquo;No one is good&mdash;except God alone.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>So, Scripture teaches all humanity have gone astray. No one does good, not even one. Then Paul teaches every human being is born as a child of wrath. We are by nature sinners. Someone once said that we are not sinners because we sinned; we sin because we were born sinners, so our sinfulness is not something that develops later in life or that convicts only after a certain age. It is something we have at birth because it is in our nature to sin.</p>\n\n<p>These passages (and many others) teach the universality of sin. We are born into Adam&#39;s sin nature and our nature condemns us from our first breath. Furthermore, the Bible never provides an exception to this fundamental Biblical principle. If there were an exception to the principle of the universality of sin, we should expect the Bible to call it out plainly and explain it explicitly, since something so important and so contrary to other teaching would require careful explanation. Instead, the Bible is utterly silent on any exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>As Paul wrote:</p>\n\n<h6>Gal. 3:22 But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>More importantly, if it were possible for God to overlook the sin of even one child and permit that child to enter into heaven apart from saving faith in Christ, then why should any person have need to confess Christ? In fact, if entrance into Heaven were possible apart from faith in the sacrificial atonement of Christ, then God need not put His Son to death in the first place. Instead, He could have forgiven everyone&#39;s sins apart from faith in the same way He is supposedly overlooks a young child&#39;s sin.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, this is not only illogical but unbiblical, since scripture tells us that faith in Christ is required and is the only way to Heaven:</p>\n\n<h6>John 17:3 &ldquo;This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>The pastor you mentioned proposed that Romans 7:9 taught an exception to this principle, but it does not teach an exception,&nbsp;and we can see this clearly when we read the verse in its full context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 7:1 &nbsp;Or do you not know, brethren (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has jurisdiction over a person as long as he lives?<br />\nRom. 7:2 For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the husband.<br />\nRom. 7:3 So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man.<br />\nRom. 7:4 &nbsp;Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.<br />\nRom. 7:5 For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death.<br />\nRom. 7:6 But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter.<br />\nRom. 7:7 &nbsp;What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, &ldquo; YOU SHALL NOT COVET.&rdquo;<br />\nRom. 7:8 But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind; for apart from the Law sin is dead.<br />\nRom. 7:9 I was once alive apart from the Law; but when the commandment came, sin became alive and I died;<br />\nRom. 7:10 and this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me;<br />\nRom. 7:11 for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.<br />\nRom. 7:12 So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.<br />\nRom. 7:13 &nbsp;Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful. &nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Paul begins this chapter in verse 1 by stating that the Law has jurisdiction over a person as long as they are alive. By jurisdiction, Paul means the Law has the authority to condemn us and judge us for our sin. Notice Paul says this power exists \"as long as he lives.\" All men stand condemned by the Law for their sin from the first day of life. The condemnation of our sin doesn&#39;t wait for some later day of accountability; on the contrary, we are condemned all our lives.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Paul says if we hope to escape the Law&#39;s condemnation, we must die to the Law, because the Law&#39;s jurisdiction only ends when we die. In verse 3 Paul uses an analogy to illustrate his point. Like a married woman who can only remarry after her husband dies, we must die to free ourselves from the Law so we can then be free to be married to Christ. Our spiritual death is accomplished on our behalf by Christ, since by His death we were considered to die to the Law and be freed from its jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>Then Paul asks in v.7 if the Law itself is the source of our condemnation? Paul says no. The cause of our condemnation was our own sin. The Law was merely the instrument God used to reveal our sin to us. For example, until we learned from God&#39;s Law that coveting was a sin, we couldn&#39;t understand that we were sinning when we coveted.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Law condemns us only in the sense that it reveals our sinfulness to us. Notice, coveting was <em>always</em> a sin; we just didn&#39;t <em>appreciate</em> the&nbsp;fact we were sinning until God&#39;s law taught us.&nbsp;The Law cannot be said to be the cause of our sin and condemnation. We were always sinful and always condemned, but we just didn&#39;t know it.</p>\n\n<p>Before we discuss verse 9 specifically, let&#39;s ask has Paul been talking about children in this passage? Has he described any exceptions to the principle that all men are condemned for their sin? Has he suggested that dying before a certain age will save us from the punishment of sin? Has he alluded in any way to an age of accountability?</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the answer to all these questions is no. Therefore, as we approach verse 9 we must guard against \"reading in\" any context other than the one Paul himself is teaching. Paul has been consistently arguing that sin and condemnation are universal, and the Law was God&#39;s instrument to reveal our sin. He has never varied or departed from this line of argument.</p>\n\n<p>From this point, we are now ready to understand verses 8-11. In these verses, Paul teaches using the example of a sinner who doesn&#39;t know God&#39;s Law.&nbsp;Paul says that apart from (a knowledge of the) Law, sin is dead. What does Paul mean?</p>\n\n<p>Well, we know from Paul&#39;s earlier teaching in Romans 5:12-14 that the penalty of sin existed even before the giving of the Law to Moses. Paul said death reigned from Adam to Moses, so the penalty of death didn&#39;t depend on a knowledge of the Law. Men were still condemned for their sin even before they understood God&#39;s standard for holiness.</p>\n\n<p>So when Paul says in Romans 7:8 that apart from Law, sin is dead, he can&#39;t mean that sin doesn&#39;t carry a penalty before we know the Law or that our sin isn&#39;t counted against us. This viewpoint would contradict Paul&#39;s earlier teaching in chapter 5.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, Paul is speaking in the first person from the perspective of a person who is ignorant of their debt before God. Before the Law was revealed, I couldn&#39;t appreciate my jeopardy before God. Sin was \"dead\" in the sense that it was unappreciated, and my conscience enjoyed a false sense of security, thinking myself alive when I was actually spirtually dead.</p>\n\n<p>Once the Law was reveal to me, however, sin \"became alive\" to me. My conscience became aware of my sinfulness and I came to understand my condemnation before God. Therefore, Paul says in verse 9 that I \"died,\" meaning I lost my false sense of innocence.</p>\n\n<p>Paul is not suggesting that a person becomes accountable for sin at a later point in life as a result of learning the Law. On the contrary, he is teaching that we were <strong>always</strong> under condemnation for sin (see Romans 5:12-14 again), but our awareness that we were condemned before God was brought to life through our knowledge of the Law.</p>\n\n<p>We can see even more clearly that this was Paul&#39;s meaning in v.13. Paul asks rhetorically if the Law is the source of our spiritual death and eternal judgment? In other words, Paul is asking the very question your&nbsp;preacher proposed: did the arrival of the Law result in my condemnation and was it the cause of my penalty?</p>\n\n<p>Paul responds may it never be. Paul specifically <strong>denies</strong> your pastor&#39;s viewpoint when he wrote&nbsp;that the Law is good and holy, and therefore it was <strong>not</strong> the cause of our eternal loss. The cause of our condemnation was our sin, and the Law was merely given to reveal our sinfulness to us.</p>\n\n<p>From this truth we must conclude that children are accountable for their sin just as adults, and everyone is&nbsp;accountable without respect to their degree of awareness of their sin.&nbsp;In fact, if we were to interpret Romans 7:9 to mean that a lack of knowledge of the Law is an excuse before God, then what do we conclude about the millions of people who lived and died before the Law was given to Moses? And what about a person today who lives in an isolated place and has no access to read the Law of God? Are they accountable for sin?</p>\n\n<p>The Bible says that all men are accountable for sin and all have sinned, with or without knowledge of the Law:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 2:11 For there is no partiality with God.<br />\nRom. 2:12 For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Paul shuts the door on any argument that presumes ignorance of the Law will save us from judgment. There is no excuse of ignorance available to men of any age.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, since the reason for our eternal death is our own sin (and not our knowledge of the Law), then all men are under the curse of eternal death from the first moment of life, since all men are born sinful in the likeness of Adam. Our condemnation before God is not a function of our awareness of our sin or of the Law; it is the consequence for having been born sinful.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, some have ignored these truths of Scripture and have chosen to teach as doctrine a precept of man (see Matthew 15:7-9). We might ask why your&nbsp;preacher (or others before&nbsp;him) felt the need to invent the concept of an age of accountability? What problem were they trying to solve that couldn&#39;t be solved by scripture alone?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is your pastor was&nbsp;trying to account for what happens to children who die too young to profess faith in the Gospel, and he did so because he didn&#39;t&nbsp;understanding how saving faith arrives in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Those who teach an age of accountability invariably also&nbsp;hold that salvation comes as&nbsp;the result of an act of human will to accept Christ. They maintain that when a&nbsp;person professes their belief, only then does&nbsp;God respond&nbsp;to the person&#39;s decision by delivering His Holy Spirit (i.e., first comes a personal decision to choose to believe, then comes the Spirit and salvation).</p>\n\n<p>This view of salvation is commonly called the \"free will\" view, because it holds that men are saved by their&nbsp;willful choice to believe in the Gospel. The \"free will\" perspective leads to&nbsp;a&nbsp;dilemma that necessitates an&nbsp;invention of the \"age of accountability,\" for&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">how else can we explain God&#39;s treatment of young people who haven&#39;t the chance to make a decision?&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Simply put,&nbsp;the invention of an age of accountability&nbsp;was&nbsp;an unfortunately, unnecessary and unbiblical response to a problem that was&nbsp;itself created by an&nbsp;equally unbiblical \"free will\" teaching of salvation.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The&nbsp;Bible gives a&nbsp;very clear and very&nbsp;different answer to this question. The Bible&#39;s answer centers on a proper understanding of the way ALL men are saved in the first place. The Bible solves this dilemma in the right way, by correcting the false presumption&nbsp;of free will salvation.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>The Biblical View<br />\n&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>In truth, the Bible teaches that salvation occurs in a very different way.</p>\n\n<p>First, the Bible teaches that no man seeks for God:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 3:10 as it is written,<br />\n&ldquo;THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;<br />\nRom. 3:11 THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS,<br />\nTHERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Furthermore, when we existed in our natural, flesh state as an unbeliever, we were spiritually hostile toward God and we could never subject ourself to God&#39;s decrees.</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 8:6 For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace,<br />\nRom. 8:7 because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so,<br />\nRom. 8:8 and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Most importantly, the Gospel message itself is incomprehensible to an unbeliever:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 2:14 But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Even when Jesus walked the Earth and demonstrated the truth of His claims to be the Christ, yet still people did not accept His testimony. Jesus Himself taught that those who are not His cannot accept His testimony:</p>\n\n<h6>John 10:24 The Jews then gathered around Him, and were saying to Him, &ldquo;How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 10:25 Jesus answered them, &ldquo; I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father&rsquo;s name, these testify of Me.<br />\nJohn 10:26 &ldquo;But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep.<br />\nJohn 10:27 &ldquo;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches in these passages (and many others) that the natural man (i.e., an unbeliever) is spirtually opposed to God, does not seek for God and is incapable of understanding spiritual truths. Biblically speaking, there is no such person as a \"seeker.\" It is spiritually impossible for an unbeliever to seek the true living God, and even when the truth of the Gospel is presented to an unbeliever, they will always reject it since it cannot be accepted by the natural man, according to Paul.</p>\n\n<p>So how can anyone believe and be saved??? Scripture seems to teach that it is impossible. As the disciples asked:</p>\n\n<h6>Mark 10:26 They were even more astonished and said to Him, &ldquo;Then who can be saved?&rdquo;<br />\nMark 10:27 Looking at them, Jesus said, &ldquo;With people it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>God saves those who cannot (and will not) save themselves. The way God saves sinners according to the Bible is very different from the process taught by \"free will\" proponents. In the Bible, the process of salvation begins not with a message or a human decision but with an act of God. What is impossible for us to do by our own decision or will, God is prepared to do on our behalf. This is the true Biblical definition of grace.</p>\n\n<p>First, the Bible says that our salvation was something God determined to make happen. God&#39;s will - not our own - determines who will be saved. Paul says this most clearly in Romans:</p>\n\n<h6>Rom. 9:15 For He says to Moses, &ldquo;I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.&rdquo;<br />\nRom. 9:16 So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Our salvation does not depend on us \"inviting Jesus into our hearts,\" as some might preach. God doesn&#39;t wait for our invitation, because no man ever extends such an invitation. As Paul teaches, our salvation does not depend on a man choosing God (i.e., the man who wills) nor does it depend on our personal efforts to accomplish good works (i.e., the man who runs).</p>\n\n<p>Instead, our salvation depends entirely on God&#39;s decision to show us compassion and elect us to saving faith. As God Himself said, He will have compassion on whom He will have compassion. His mercy and compassion don&#39;t rest on our will or effort. The decision to save is solely God&#39;s alone.</p>\n\n<p>Paul repeats this truth in Ephesians:</p>\n\n<h6>Eph. 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,<br />\nEph. 1:4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love<br />\nEph. 1:5 He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,<br />\nEph. 1:6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>It was the kind intention of God&#39;s will that resulted in us having been chosen for salvation even before we were born - even before the foundations of the Earth were laid!</p>\n\n<p>Next, Scripture teaches that our salvation process begins with a work of the Holy Spirit. Consider these passages from Scripture:</p>\n\n<h6>1Cor. 12:3 Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, &ldquo;Jesus is accursed&rdquo;; and no one can say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; except by the Holy Spirit.</h6>\n\n<h6>John 6:65 And He was saying, &ldquo;For this reason I have said to you, that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted him from the Father.&rdquo;<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>The process of salvation begins with the baptism of the Holy Spirit, which is the moment the Holy Spirit comes upon us and quickens our hearts to hear the Gospel and believe the testimony of Christ. Without this work of the Holy Spirit, we would never accept the things of God, as Paul said. Since the Holy Spirit must be present and working in our hearts BEFORE we will come to faith, we understand that God must act first in choosing to send us His Spirit so that we will receive the Gospel.</p>\n\n<p>In Matthew 16, Jesus taught this same truth to the Apostel Peter following Peter&#39;s famous confession of faith, telling Peter that his faith was something given to him by God.</p>\n\n<h6>Matt. 16:16 Simon Peter answered, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo;<br />\nMatt. 16:17 And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Paul also teaches this truth in Ephesians:</p>\n\n<h6>Eph. 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;<br />\nEph. 2:9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Paul teaches that our faith was a gift of God. Our ability to believe in the Gospel was the result of God&#39;s gracious work through the Spirit, so that we could never boast that our salvation was the result of our decision or will or sound judgment, etc. We believed in the Gospel because we were made to believe by the Spirit. Glory be to God!</p>\n\n<p>Following the Spirit&#39;s work in the heart, a person then responds in faith. First, the person comes to an understanding and acceptance of the Gospel recognizing their changed spiritual perspective. Next, they profess their faith publicly. Lastly, they obey Christ&#39;s command and are baptized. These are all expected human responses to the spiritual change God produces in the heart by His Spirit.</p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>The Question of Children<br />\n&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n<p>Having established how we are saved, we can now understand the disposition of children who die at an early age. If salvation is not an act of human will (or intellect) but is solely dependent on God&#39;s grace and mercy, then we must conclude that anyone can be saved at any age. Even an infant can be given the gift of faith by God&#39;s Spirit, and regardless of the child&#39;s age or their inability to express their faith publicly, they are still believing.</p>\n\n<p>Scripture gives us proof of this possibility. First, we have the example of David again:</p>\n\n<h6>Psa. 22:9 Yet you brought me out of the womb;<br />\nyou made me trust in you<br />\neven at my mother&rsquo;s breast.<br />\n<br />\nPsa. 22:10 From birth I was cast upon you;<br />\nfrom my mother&rsquo;s womb you have been my God.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Isn&#39;t that remarkable? David confesses that he was made to trust in God (or believe) while he was still a nursing baby. In fact, David says that he was cast upon God from birth. David&#39;s account in the Psalms tells us that God is capable of producing faith in someone even while they are too young to hear and understand the words of the Gospel, much less express their faith to someone else.</p>\n\n<p>Because our salvation is accomplished through a spiritual understanding (not by an intellectual understanding), salvation doesn&#39;t require that our brain have developed to any specific degree. It is purely a work of God by His Spirit in our spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Next, consider the example of John the Baptist:</p>\n\n<h6>Luke 1:13 But the angel said to him: &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.<br />\nLuke 1:14 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,<br />\nLuke 1:15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Like David, the parents of John the Baptist were promised that their son would receive the Holy Spirit even before he was born. Paul teaches in Romans 8:14 that the leading of the Holy Spirit is evidence that we have become children of God by faith. Therefore, John the Baptist became a child of God while still in his mother&#39;s womb!</p>\n\n<p>If it were true that salvation necessitated a person have the will and intellect to understand and receive a Gospel presentation, then how do we explain the experience of John the Baptist? How could the angel say that John the Baptist would receive the Holy Spirit before he was born? Are we to assume that John heard and understood the Gospel while in the womb?</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, the answer is no. Rather, we must conclude that the process of salvation is not dependent on human understanding. It is in entirely God&#39;s hands, and He is capable of granting the gift of faith and thus saving infants if He chooses.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, men didn&#39;t need to invent an answer to the question of what happens to infants who die. We didn&#39;t need the false teaching of an age of accountability. Instead, we only needed to understand the way God teaches that He saves men: He intervenes mercifully into our sinful lives and grants us new life by His Spirit thereby making us new creatures in Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Since we know He can do this to anyone at anytime, then we can rest in the confidence that children are not outside His reach nor without His grace.</p>\n\n<p>For a more detailed exploration of these matters, we recommend you read <strong><a href=\"/resource_library/articles/wrestling_with_god/\">Wrestling With God.</a></strong></p>"

This sounded strange to me, so I wonder are Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses truly Christian?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses (JWs) are not a Christian movement, and their teachings are not biblical. They preach a false gospel, and we strongly recommend you avoid their teaching.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The JW&#39;s views on the dead is a good example of their unbiblical teaching. It is easy to demonstrate from scripture that every human being&nbsp;continues to exist in a conscious form after death and does&nbsp;not &ldquo;cease.&rdquo; For example, in Luke 16 Jesus Himself told an account of what happened&nbsp;to men at death &ndash;&nbsp;both believers and unbelievers &ndash;&nbsp;prior to the resurrection of Christ. We recommend you read the account for yourself.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Also in Luke, Jesus says that after our body dies, we should be concerned over where our soul will live:</span></p>\n\n<h6><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 12:4 &nbsp;&ldquo;I say to you,&nbsp; My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Luke 12:5 &nbsp;&ldquo;But I will warn you whom to fear: fear the One who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him!</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Notice Jesus says that after a person&#39;s body is gone, they still live on in soul form. Men do not cease to exist after death, or else men would have no reason to be concerned about&nbsp;Hell, yet Jesus says we <em>should</em> consider these things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, in 2Corinthians&nbsp;Paul taught that a believer in Christ moves directly in conscious form into the presence of&nbsp;the Lord at the death of the body:</span></p>\n\n<h6>2Cor. 5:6 &nbsp;Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord &mdash;&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Cor. 5:7 for we walk by faith, not by sight &mdash;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2Cor. 5:8 &nbsp;we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and&nbsp; to be at home with the Lord.&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Finally, we&nbsp;find proof that unbelievers also live forever in conscious torment by the example of two men, who will deceive the world during the coming tribulation:&nbsp;the antichrist and the false prophet. The Bible says these men exist forever in the Lake of Fire (as will all unbelievers):</span></p>\n\n<h6>Rev. 20:10 &nbsp;And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;brimstone, where the beast&nbsp;and&nbsp;the false prophet are also;&nbsp;and&nbsp;they will be tormented day&nbsp;and&nbsp;night forever&nbsp;and ever.</h6>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">To learn more about why&nbsp;JWs follow a false Gospel, we&nbsp;recommend you listen to <a href=\"/bible-studies/god_and_man_easter_2013\">God and Man</a>,&nbsp;a recent preaching by Pastor Armstrong concerning JWs and their false views of Christ.</span></p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Could you please explain the significance of 2 Chronicles 2?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. In 2 Chronicles, we read about Solomon&rsquo;s kingship. In chapter 1, Solomon goes to Gibeon where the bronze altar and the tabernacle of the Lord were. He offers sacrifices and worships God in the way God required this to be done. That night, God visits Solomon and asks him what he would like Him to give him. Rather than asking for wealth, power, etc., Solomon instead asks, &ldquo;Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this great people of Yours?&rdquo; (2 Chronicles 1:10)</p>\n<p>\n\tGod had appointed Solomon to be king, and he took this responsibility seriously. As shown in his request, he asks for the things that will enable him to fulfill this great responsibility he&rsquo;s been given. Because he asks for wisdom and knowledge, which will enable him to serve God more ably, God honors his request. Because he didn&rsquo;t ask for riches, wealth or honor, God also blesses him with these things, so much so that no king before nor after Solomon had as much wealth, honor and riches. This sets the context for some of what we read in chapter 2.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn chapter 2, we read of Solomon making ready to build the house of the Lord. Solomon&rsquo;s father, David, had wanted to build God&rsquo;s house, but God reserved this task for Solomon. This is found in 2 Samuel 7 (God speaking a message to the prophet Nathan to give to David):<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Sam. 7:12 &ldquo; When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom.<br />\n\t2Sam. 7:13 &ldquo; He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.<br />\n\t2Sam. 7:14 &ldquo; I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men,<br />\n\t2Sam. 7:15 but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.<br />\n\t2Sam. 7:16 &ldquo; Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tNotice the Messianic language in this passage. While God is speaking about Solomon, He is also speaking about Jesus our Messiah. We will look at this more closely as we discuss chapter 2.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/GB_king_solomon.gif\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; float: right; width: 400px; height: 306px; \" />First, let&rsquo;s look at the literal text of chapter 2. Solomon starts the task of building God&rsquo;s house, as well as a palace for himself. Notice the vast number of people Solomon puts to the task, 153,600 in total! None of these people, however, were Israelites. All of them were aliens, a term which refers to people living in Israel but who had no inherited rights. Most likely, these are Gentiles who were not utterly destroyed when Israel entered the promised land. At this point, they are now labor for king Solomon. These were not slaves, and some actually converted to Judaism.</p>\n<p>\n\tSolomon also enlists the help of Huram (pronounced khoo-rawm), king of Tyre. Solomon asks for the wood to build God&rsquo;s house, as well as for a skilled craftsman. Solomon, of course, offers to pay for the men&rsquo;s services. Huram gladly accepts Solomon&rsquo;s request, and he glorifies God in his response. It is very likely that Huram was a believer.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the literal text tells us how Solomon plans to build God&rsquo;s house and his palace, where he will get the supplies and who will do the work. This fulfills what God promised in 2 Samuel 7. No longer will God&rsquo;s house be a temporary tabernacle, but a magnificent structure that will be unlike any other building on earth. However, there is a greater meaning here than what the literal text tells us. Remember Jesus&rsquo; words, that the Scriptures testify about Him (John 5:39). Given what we read earlier in 2 Samuel 7, Solomon is clearly a type of Christ. As we look closer at the text we will see the underlying picture of Christ as portrayed in Solomon.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, remember that Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge so he could rule God&rsquo;s people. This is a picture of Christ as the greatest and wisest king, the King of kings. Indeed, even Huram obeys him. God also gave him wealth and riches, more than any person would ever have. This, too, is a picture of Christ, which we read in Colossians 2:2-3:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tCol. 2:2 that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God&rsquo;s mystery, that is, Christ Himself,<br />\n\tCol. 2:3 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThe purpose of the house Solomon is building for God is &ldquo;to burn fragrant incense before Him and to set out the showbread continually, and to offer burnt offerings morning and evening, on sabbaths and on new moons and on the appointed feasts of the LORD our God, this being required forever in Israel.&rdquo; These are the things God required of Israel under the Mosaic Law, things that were necessary to take away sin and the manner in which God was to be worshiped. But they all pointed to Christ, in whom the Law was fulfilled. Hebrews 9:1-10 describes the tabernacle:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 9:1 Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.<br />\n\tHeb. 9:2 For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place.<br />\n\tHeb. 9:3 Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,<br />\n\tHeb. 9:4 having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron&rsquo;s rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant;<br />\n\tHeb. 9:5 and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail.<br />\n\tHeb. 9:6 &nbsp;Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship,<br />\n\tHeb. 9:7 but into the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.<br />\n\tHeb. 9:8 The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing,<br />\n\tHeb. 9:9 which is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience,<br />\n\tHeb. 9:10 since they relate only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation. &nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tHebrews 9:11-15 continues, explaining how Christ is our perfect tabernacle:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 9:11 &nbsp;But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;<br />\n\tHeb. 9:12 and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.<br />\n\tHeb. 9:13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,<br />\n\tHeb. 9:14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?<br />\n\tHeb. 9:15 &nbsp;For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. &nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, the tabernacle Solomon is building is a picture of Christ, who will fulfill the Law, and who will replace the physical tabernacle. He entered through the true tabernacle, and made the way, the only way, for sinners to be reconciled to an all holy God. By faith in Him, we are cleansed by His blood and have access into the Holy of Holies, to God Himself.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, the temple of God that Solomon is building also points to the true temple of God, which is the church, which include you and me. Just as Solomon correctly stated in v. 6, there is no one able to build a house for our God. Indeed, the true temple, the church, is being built by God. We read about this in Ephesians 2:19-21:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 2:19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God&rsquo;s household,<br />\n\tEph. 2:20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,<br />\n\tEph. 2:21 in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThe one who builds the church is Christ Himself (Matthew 16:18), and as Ephesians 2 says, He is building us together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit. So, as Solomon realizes, only God can build a house for Himself. Thankfully, WE are His house!</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, the Lord allows us to participate in the building of His house, although He is the one who builds it through us. God alone is the one who gives salvation, but He has graciously allowed us to be the instruments through which He will work to build His church. As we work, we are enabled to do God&rsquo;s works by the power of His indwelling Holy Spirit. Notice in v. 2:7 that Solomon asks for a &ldquo;skilled man to work in gold, silver, brass and iron, and in purple, crimson and violet fabrics, and who knows how to make engravings, to work with the skilled men whom I have in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tIt seems odd that there is no man in all of Israel with such skills. Instead, Solomon has to get such a person sent to him. Likewise, given that there are 153,600 people working on the temple, it seems strange that Solomon is asking for a single man to do this skilled work. This, I believe, is a picture of the Holy Spirit, whom God sends to every individual believer. Note that this skilled man will work with Solomon&rsquo;s skilled men. Likewise, only by the power of the Spirit can we build God&rsquo;s house and perform good works. Just as Solomon rewarded the Huram&rsquo;s workers for their service, God will also give us rewards for the good works we perform by the power of His Holy Spirit, as long as we build on the foundation of Christ. 1 Corinthians 3 tells us about these good works and related rewards:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Cor. 3:11 For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br />\n\t1Cor. 3:12 Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,<br />\n\t1Cor. 3:13 each man&rsquo;s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man&rsquo;s work.<br />\n\t1Cor. 3:14 If any man&rsquo;s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.<br />\n\t1Cor. 3:15 If any man&rsquo;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.<br />\n\t1Cor. 3:16 &nbsp;Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<br />\n\t1Cor. 3:17 If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tNotice the similarities of what is considered a &ldquo;good work&rdquo;. In 2 Chronicles 2, the skilled man Huram sends is skilled in working with gold, silver, brass and iron, elements that will survive God&rsquo;s testing fire. Works we do in the Spirit are works that are built on the foundation of Jesus Christ, works that contribute to the church. These are works that are done by the gifts of the Spirit that are given to believers. Such works will be rewarded. Works that we do in the power of our flesh, well meaning as they may be, will be burned up and will not be rewarded. All believers will be saved, but we can miss out on God&rsquo;s rewards when we try to serve Him in our flesh. We are God&rsquo;s temple, indwelt by the Holy Spirit; as such, we are holy and should live holy lives. If we live solely in the flesh, God will destroy us because our actions do not glorify His name. Again, we will be saved, but we will miss out on rewards.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also get some information on the skilled man Huram sends to Solomon. We are told his name is &ldquo;Huram-abi&rdquo;. Huram means &ldquo;noble born&rdquo;. &ldquo;Abi&rdquo; means &ldquo;father of an individual&rdquo;, but it can also mean the &ldquo;originator, founder&rdquo; of a group, clan or family. As a picture of the Holy Spirit, we can view the Spirit as the noble (or kingly) originator of the church since it is the Spirit who gives life (John 6:63). Perhaps more importantly, we read that Huram-abi is &ldquo;the son of a Danite woman and a Tyrian father&rdquo;. This would be a person who is both Jewish and Gentile, combined in one person. Again, Scripture sheds light on this in Ephesians 2:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tEph. 2:11 &nbsp;Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called &ldquo; Uncircumcision&rdquo; by the so-called &ldquo; Circumcision,&rdquo; which is performed in the flesh by human hands &mdash;<br />\n\tEph. 2:12 remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.<br />\n\tEph. 2:13 But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.<br />\n\tEph. 2:14 For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,<br />\n\tEph. 2:15 by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace,<br />\n\tEph. 2:16 and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.<br />\n\tEph. 2:17 AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR; &nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn Christ, we are no longer Jews and Gentiles, but are united as one in the Spirit. It is through the Spirit that this reconciliation is accomplished, giving us access to the Father. Huram-abi is a great picture of this.</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier we mentioned the 153,600 &ldquo;aliens&rdquo;. The Hebrew word is &ldquo;ger&rdquo;, which refers to a sojourner, a temporary inhabitant who lacked rights in the land he was living. This is exactly what Scripture says of Christians. 1 Peter 2:11 says, &ldquo;Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.&rdquo; Similarly, Hebrews 11 states, &ldquo;8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.&rdquo; We are like the aliens in 2 Chronicles 2 who Solomon the king assigns the work of building God&rsquo;s house, with the help of Huram-abi. We have been assigned to build God&rsquo;s temple by King Jesus, who is building His house through us by the power of His Holy Spirit.</p>\n<p>\n\tMay we be found a faithful steward in God&rsquo;s house, keeping ourselves pure and holy. May we fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, as we look for the city whose builder and maker is our God.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. How does one truly worship? Is worship learned or is it something that you just do naturally? Does it require a certain feeling or emotional state?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. By worship, we assume you are referring to the practice of Christians singing praise music during a church service. Obviously, worship is a much broader concept than this narrow definition, but many Christians have come to see worship in this limited context.</p>\n<p>\n\tScripture, on the other hand, defines worship as obedience. For example, Paul defines worship this way:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 12:1 Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tNotice that Paul doesn&#39;t define worship as having anything to do with a mood or a feeling. It certainly isn&#39;t focused on singing or music at all. These types of \"worship\" are merely outward expressions of our faith and love for God, and though they may have some value, they are not the substance of true worship. True worship is obedience to God through His Spirit and His word.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, our feelings and mood are counterproductive when trying to establish appropriate worship practices. Instead, we are called to praise and worship the Lord despite our circumstances. For example, Paul praised the Lord for hours after receiving a beating and while chained in a dark jail cell (see Acts 16). If worship were conditioned on emotion and feelings, Paul would never have found reason to praise God. Similarly, the writer of Hebrews instructed:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tHeb. 13:15 Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tOur understanding of praise or worship shouldn&#39;t be merely a form of musical celebration contingent on having the right mood or emotion. The Bible says true worship and praise is rooted in a life of obedience and is a continual activity.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can find a good example of this distinction in the Old Testament book of 1Samuel. The prophet Samuel admonished King Saul with these words:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Sam. 15:22 Samuel said,<br />\n\t&ldquo; Has the LORD as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices<br />\n\tAs in obeying the voice of the LORD?<br />\n\tBehold, to obey is better than sacrifice,<br />\n\tAnd to heed than the fat of rams.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tWorship in that day took the form of burnt offerings and sacrifices given in the temple, and Samuel asks the King is it better to perform worship (i.e., to offer the sin sacrifices in the temple) or to obey the Lord? The answer is clear: it is better to obey God than to offer Him sacrifices. God&#39;s first and highest desire for His people is that we obey Him. If we fail to obey Him but come to \"praise\" Him in \"worship,\" we are hypocrites.</p>\n<p>\n\tIsrael was once guilty of approaching God in worship with hearts that did not obey Him, and about those people the Lord said through Isaiah:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tIs. 29:13 Then the Lord said,<br />\n\t&ldquo;Because this people draw near with their words<br />\n\tAnd honor Me with their lip service,<br />\n\tBut they remove their hearts far from Me,<br />\n\tAnd their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote,<br />\n\tIs. 29:14 Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous;<br />\n\tAnd the wisdom of their wise men will perish,<br />\n\tAnd the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tGod promises a great judgment against Israel for their conceit and hypocrisy.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, we today must be aware that how we spend our time singing or praising God&#39;s name in a worship service is important only if it is preceded by a life of obedience and service to Him.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf a believer is living a holy and sanctified life in obedience to the Spirit and the word of God, then such a person is also likely to find it easy to express their love and praise for God in a worship service, just as they do on a continual basis outside the church building. Their praise will come naturally from the Spirit&#39;s leading.</p>\n<p>\n\tConversely, if a Christian is not accustomed to walking with the Spirit and seeking God&#39;s counsel in His word and if they don&#39;t make a practice of worshipping as a daily (if not hourly) activity, then they will find any expression of worship difficult, including the kind that takes place on Sunday morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is nothing magical about worship (setting aside supernatural manifestations of Spirit), because it should be the moment-to-moment practice of our life. When we attend a church service, we don&#39;t come to \"worship.\" According to Scripture, we gather together for the purpose of serving and encouraging one another, learning God&#39;s word, and lending our voices to public confession, prayer and praise of God. These activities are made meaningful to God when they are done in a true heart that desires to know and obey God through His word. Taken together, this is true worship.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are interested in hearing more teaching on obedience as it relates to worship, we invite you to listen to our teaching on <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/obedience_as_worship/\"><strong>Obedience as Worship</strong></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I know the Bible teaches that God saves those whom He chooses, but in 2Peter 3:9 the Bible says that God does not want any to perish. Doesn&#39;t this mean God wants everyone to be saved?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. If we try to apply Peter&#39;s statement in this passage to the question of salvation, we are taking Peter&#39;s words out of context and thereby misinterpreting them.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe context of Peter&#39;s statement in 2Peter 3:9 is a discussion about the Lord&#39;s promise to return for the Church. Let&#39;s look at the full context:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Pet. 3:1 This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,<br />\n\t2Pet. 3:2 that you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior spoken by your apostles.<br />\n\t2Pet. 3:3 Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with their mocking, following after their own lusts,<br />\n\t2Pet. 3:4 and saying, &ldquo; Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation.&rdquo;<br />\n\t2Pet. 3:5 For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and by water,<br />\n\t2Pet. 3:6 through which the world at that time was destroyed, being flooded with water.<br />\n\t2Pet. 3:7 But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.<br />\n\t2Pet. 3:8 But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.<br />\n\t2Pet. 3:9 The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.<br />\n\t2Pet. 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tFirst, notice that the point of Peter&#39;s passage is given in v.4: he is addressing those who cast doubt on Jesus&#39; promise to return for His Church. Remember, Jesus didn&#39;t promise to return for everyone. He promised to return for His Church. Remember His words spoken to the disciples in John 14:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tJohn 14:1 &ldquo;Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me.<br />\n\tJohn 14:2 &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.<br />\n\tJohn 14:3 &ldquo;If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThis is the promise Peter is discussing. Peter says in the last days, many will come mocking Jesus&#39; promise to return. Mockers will claim that He is not returning for His Church. These mockers will base their accusations on the fact that so much time has passed since Jesus&#39; made the promise. They claim God&#39;s promise isn&#39;t trustworthy merely because so much time has passed since the promise was given.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn responding to that accusation, Peter reminds us that time doesn&#39;t pose a threat to God&#39;s promises, because God lives outside time. A long passage of time (i.e., a thousand years) is no different to God than the passage of a day, and therefore God&#39;s promises are no less certain after thousands of year than they were in the day they were spoken.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe mockers will claim that the long delay in Jesus&#39; promised return is evidence that His promise isn&#39;t trustworthy, but Peter offers a different reason why God has waited so long to send Jesus back to Earth. The answer is because God doesn&#39;t want any to perish. The fundamental question in understanding this passage is who are the \"any\" in this statement? Based on the context of Peter&#39;s discussion, \"any\" are the church, those who believe. In other words, God will ensure that before Jesus returns for the Church, God has called every person intended for faith into the Body of Christ..</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom Peter&#39;s teaching (and others in the New Testament), we come to understand that God has a plan for an appointed number of believers in the church, and God has set that number from the foundations of the Earth (<em>see Eph 1:4</em>). God has an appointed number of believers He intends to save (<em>see Acts 13:48</em><em>; 22:14</em>), and these believers are scattered across many nations and throughout the course of history. God is patiently waiting, Peter says, for thse elect to be born and to believe in their appointed day. Only after the last appointed believer comes to faith will Christ return for His Church, thereby ensuring that none (of His children) perish.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn summary, Peter&#39;s context in 2Peter 3 is clearly talking about Jesus&#39; promise to return for His Church, and Peter says God does not want any (of His Church) to perish. Once the Lord returns, the opportunity for the world to believe during this age comes to an end, so if the Lord were to return \"early,\" some of those among future generations of believers would perish in the sense that they wouldn&#39;t have had the opportunity to be born and believe.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome have taken this statement in 2Peter to mean God is patient because He doesn&#39;t want any human beings to perish. This interpretation is literally impossible. First, people are perishing in their unbelief every day, so if God were \"waiting\" for all to believe, then God&#39;s waiting would be in vain and would never end. Jesus&#39; Second Coming could never happen if God is waiting for none to perish! Clearly, Peter cannot mean that God is waiting for the world to believe. God knows many will not believe, so the timing of His return is not dependent on their coming to faith, just as Paul said:</p>\n<h5>\n\t2Cor. 4:3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, such an interpretation is self-contradictory. Peter&#39;s second letter teaches that one day the Lord <strong>will</strong> return, and when He arrives, He destroys all who have not believed&nbsp;(<em>see 2Peter 3:7 and Revelation 19-20</em>). So if Peter were teaching that the Lord is waiting because He wishes no human beings would perish, then Peter&#39;s teaching that the Lord returns to destroy the ungodly would be contradictory! Peter would be teaching that the Lord is planning to act against His own wishes, which is impossible. Clearly, God will not hesitate to destroy the wicked in the day of judgment, therefore He has not delayed that day for their sake. &nbsp;Instead, He has delayed it for the sake of the elect.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsequently, we cannot assume that the word \"any\" means \"all human beings.\" &nbsp;Instead, the context of Peter&#39;s letter makes clear that \"any\" means \"all of God&#39;s elect.\"</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. &nbsp;How can I reconcile the God of the Old Testament who destroys nations of people with the Jesus of the New Testament who offers mercy and love?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Many Bible students have wrestled with what seems to be a contradiction between the God of the Old Testement &nbsp;and the God of the New Testement. In the Old Testement they read accounts of God directing Israel to utterly destroy its enemies, while in the New Testament Jesus and the Apostles tell us to forgive our enemies and show grace to those who persecute us. Are these two persepctives in conflict?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe answer is no, and to understand why, we need to seek a better understanding of God&#39;s true nature and the teaching of Scripture concerning this question. While we could fill books with a full discussion of this topic (and many authors have already), we will try to offer a brief overview now while encouraging you to study this question further on your own.</p>\n<h4>\n\t<br />\n\tGod&#39;s Consistent Character<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tAt the heart of this question is the consistency of God&#39;s character. When we ask if the OT and NT gods are different, we suggest that God&#39;s character is limited to either mercy or judgment but He cannot display both. &nbsp;This assumption is simply not reasonable nor biblically accurate.</p>\n<p>\n\tScripture teaches that God&#39;s character remains consistent throughout the Old Testament and New Testament. From Genesis to Revelation, God is shown to be a God of love, mercy and patience. Similarly, both the OT and NT reveal God&#39;s wrath, anger, and vengeance. Thumbing through the pages of both the OT and the NT you will find many references a loving Father Who extends mercy and grace even to His enemies, and you will also find a God who hates sin and is willing to demonstrate His wrath against sinners. Both sides of God are represented in both testements.&nbsp;Therefore, to think that the OT and NT depict different gods is an erroneous assumption in iteself.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, it is illogical to assume that God cannot be loving and merciful while also demonstrating wrath against sin. Love, mercy, wrath and judgment are not mutually exclusive character traits. In fact, they are complimentary personality traits. It is no more contradictory to say that God can display both wrath and mercy than it is to say we can feel both love and hatred from time to time.</p>\n<p>\n\tThirdly, real personalities are multifaceted and will naturally manefest different responses to different circumstances. For example, when we encounter a rude person, we may feel anger, but when we encounter a kind person, we may feel love. Likewise, God may choose to display His wrath when confronted with sin and disobedience, or He may choose to display mercy and forgiveness. Either choice would be a legitimate responses to sin. God&#39;s lovingkindness and His burning wrath are two sides of His character and personality, and He may exhibit either one or the other as He pleases.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tFourth, God is bound by His own perfect nature. He <em>must</em> act in perfect ways. He cannot sin and He cannot lie, according to Scripture. Therefore, He must display His wrath against unrepentent sin and bring His judgment against those who have not received the atoning work of Christ. He cannot overlook sin or else He Himself commits an injustice. Conversely, God is just when He shows His favor to those who are justified by grace through faith Christ&#39;s sacrifice. So, God&#39;s own perfection will require He react in different ways under differnet circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, God&#39;s personality is not disproportionately wrathful in the OT nor disproportionately merciful in the NT as some might claim. In reality, both the OT and NT testify equally to God&#39;s mercy and to His wrath.&nbsp;For example, in the OT God displays His anger against sinning Israelites at multiple points during their wanderings in the desert, yet He also showed His great mercy in sending Jonah to preach the Gospel to the city of Nineveh.&nbsp;In the NT, we see God&#39;s love and mercy in sending His Son to die for the sins of men, yet we also read in the letters of Paul, Peter and John about the coming judgment that awaits the unbelieving world (and the book of Revelation offers a detailed and chilling account of how God brings terrible judgments upon the world shortly before the return of Christ.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tOverall, some of the greatest examples of God&#39;s grace and mercy are evident in the OT (<em>i.e</em>., Joseph, the Exodus, Ruth, Esther, Jonah) while God&#39;s most terrifying displays of wrath and anger are described by Jesus in Matthew 24 and in the book of Revelation. Clearly, the Bible presents a balanced and nuanced perspective of a God Who possesses a full personality.</p>\n<h4>\n\t<br />\n\tGod&#39;s Sovereignty in Displaying His Mercy<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tGod does not contradict Himself when He chooses to show mercy to some people but wrath to others. Scripture teaches that God&#39;s wrath is the expected and appropriate response to sinful mankind under all circumstances, since we know the Bible teaches that no man does good and all are sinful (<em>see Romans 3</em>). Therefore when God shows mercy instead, it is truly grace (unmerited favor) made available as God chooses. He is under no obligation to ever extend mercy, yet in love He offers mercy to some for His own purposes. In keeping with God&#39;s perfect nature, God found a way to judge sin justly (<em>i.e</em>., upon Christ on the cross) while at the same time justifying the sinner through faith in the work of Jesus (<em>see Rom 3:21-26</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Bible teaches that God&#39;s grace is a matter of His sovereignty, and God owes no mercy to anyone. Simply put, God may display His wrath against some while showing mercy to others because God&#39;s sovereignty affords Him this right. Paul put it best in Romans 9:14-18:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 9:14 &nbsp;What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!<br />\n\tRom. 9:15 For He says to Moses, &ldquo; I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.&rdquo;<br />\n\tRom. 9:16 So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.<br />\n\tRom. 9:17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &ldquo; FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.&rdquo;<br />\n\tRom. 9:18 So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.</h5>\n<h4>\n\t<br />\n\tGod&#39;s Prerogative in Executing His Judgment<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tWhen God is criticized for displaying His wrath in the OT, most of that criticism is centered on the time of Joshua and the Israelites entering the Promised Land. As a nation, Israel had entered into a covenant with God, which bound all of the nation to abide by God&#39;s standards of holiness (see Deut 29:10-15). In keeping with this covenant, God agreed to bring them into a land He would give them, but He commanded them to extinguish the sinners from the land to ensure the nation&#39;s holy status. The Israelites were to be God&#39;s instrument to execute His judgment against the sinners who occupied the land.</p>\n<p>\n\tGod is inherently just when He brings judgment against sin (once again, He owes no one mercy), and God is free to choose any means He wishes to carry out His judgments. In the time of Joshua, God chose to use Israel&#39;s army to carry out His judgment against the Canaanites. By contrast, God choose a supernatural means to judge Sodom and Gomorrah. Neither is inherently better or worse. God is free to choose any method that suits Him, and Israel was God&#39;s appointed instrument of judgment during the time of Joshua.<br />\n\t<br />\n\tGod commanded Israel to show no mercy to these inhabitants, because God had determined centuries earlier that the Canaanite people would not receive God&#39;s mercy in the day of Joshua. God told Abraham in Genesis 15:13-16 that these people were designated for judgment even before they had been born:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tGen. 15:13 God said to Abram, &ldquo;Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years.<br />\n\tGen. 15:14 &ldquo;But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions.<br />\n\tGen. 15:15 &ldquo;As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age.<br />\n\tGen. 15:16 &ldquo;Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tThe Lord&#39;s mention of the Amorite is a reference to the Canaanites who were vanquished by Joshua. God said He would send Abraham&#39;s decedents outside the land for four hundred years, because God wasn&#39;t ready for the Canaanites to be judged. When that judgment was ready, however, God brought Israel into the land to become His instrument of judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, when God has not specifically given His people the decree to act as His instrument of judgment, we are not permitted to assume that role for ourselves. God instructed Israel to show mercy to other peoples when He choose to extend mercy rather than judgment.&nbsp;This is the essential difference between the OT and NT, though the principle can be seen equally in both places.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<meta content=\"text/html;charset=UTF-8\" http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe best example of this pattern is seen when He commanded Jonah to preach a message of salvation to Israel&#39;s enemies in Nineveh. Jonah preferred to see the Ninevites judged, so he ran from God&#39;s presence and tried to force God&#39;s hand to judgment. Instead, God pursued Jonah and required him to preach a message of repentance leading to salvation.&nbsp;(Our ministry offers a comprehensive teaching on the story of Jonah and the way the Lord demonstrated His mercy in that day. You can find that teaching in our&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_book_of_jonah/\">Jonah study</a></strong>.)</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n</p>\n<p>\n\tGod&#39;s decision to use Israel as an messenger of His mercy and also an instrument of His wrath is the prerogative of a holy God. He has created all things to serve His purposes and to reflect His glory, and He may do as He wishes with His creation without respect to our preferences (See Roman 9 again).</p>\n<p>\n\tWe see this truth continue into the NT, when Jesus give commands to His disciples to never take vengeance or revenge against others. Instead, Jesus says we must forgive 70 times 7 and we must love our enemies. Furthermore, Paul taught:<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tRom. 12:19 Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, &ldquo; VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,&rdquo; says the Lord.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tHere we see God specifically prohibiting His people from taking judgment upon themselves. Rather, we are to leave all judgment to God. This is exactly the same pattern as in the book of Joshua. All judgment was left to God, though God chose to exercise His judgment through the army of Israel. Today, God has decreed that judgment is reserved for the day of Christ&#39;s return, so we are not free to act as judge in the meantime.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe difference between God&#39;s actions in Joshua&#39;s day and His actions today are a reflection of His prerogative as God and in keeping with His purposes to extend mercy and grace during this age. In the day of Joshua, God was intent on building up His people in Israel rather than extending mercy to the Gentiles nations. Today, God is extending mercy to the Gentiles nations in keeping with His promises to Abraham. (If you are interested in an in-depth teaching on God&#39;s plan for Israel and the Gentile nations, we encourage you to listen to chapters 9-11 of our <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_book_of_romans/\">Romans study</a></strong>).<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\tSummary<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>\n\tGod&#39;s nature and character includes both mercy and love together with anger and judgment against sin. God displays all sides of His personality consistently across both the Old and New Testaments. Furthermore, God is just when He displays His wrath against sin, but in mercy He chooses to show grace to some when He desires. This is the inherent right of a sovereign God. Finally, God used the nation of Israel to carry out His wrath against sinful nations, while today He has instructed the Church to refrain from judging. Ultimately, God reserves all judgment for Himself, and Scripture teaches that He intends to bring that judgment by His own hand in a future day.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. What is the difference between the Father, Son and Holy Spirit? Can you explain the Trinity?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all Christians believe that Jesus is God?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Scripture tells us that God is one: &ldquo;Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!&rdquo; (Deuteronomy 6:4). At the same time, God is also Three Persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. For example, we see this truth evident in several chapters in Isaiah (Isaiah 6, 9, 42, 48, 63), and even in Genesis 1:26.</p>\n\n<p>While we cannot fully comprehend the Trinity in this life, Scripture clearly teaches that God is three Persons in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, yet is also One God. Scripture will also, at times, refer to the Persons of the Trinity interchangeably. An example is the &ldquo;Spirit of Christ&rdquo; (Romans 8:9, 1 Peter 1:11), which clearly refers to Jesus and the Holy Spirit as One. Jesus even says that He and the Father are One (John 10:30). How is this possible? Again, we don&rsquo;t know, but we will all know when we meet our glorious God in heaven.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the differences between each person of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), Scripture does show some different roles played by each person. For example, God the Father is active in the election of believers (e.g., Romans 9). God the Son is the person who reconciles us to the Father by His death and resurrection, and by His imputed righteousness (e.g., Romans 4-5). God the Holy Spirit makes us spiritually alive (Ephesians 2). So, we are chosen by the Father, reconciled through the Son, all by the Spirit. Ephesians 2:18 says it best: &ldquo;for through Him [Jesus] we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Much more could be said about God&rsquo;s Trinitarian nature, as books have been written on this subject. One we would recommend is by John Owen, entitled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Communion-Triune-God-John-Owen/dp/1581348312/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302099070&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Communion with the Triune God</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Those who claim to be Christian yet deny that the Trinity or that Jesus is the Son of God are not, by definition, Christians. Jesus tells us this very plainly in Luke 10:16, &ldquo;The one who listens to you listens to Me, and the one who rejects you rejects Me; and he who rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.&rdquo; 1 John 2:23 also makes this clear: &ldquo;Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also.&rdquo; By denying that Jesus is the Son, one denies the Son. If one denies the Son, he also denies the Father, and therefore, cannot be a Christian.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, all true Christians believe that Jesus is God. Over and over again, Scripture refers to Jesus as God. Isaiah 9:6 prophesies about Jesus, calling Him God: &ldquo;For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.&rdquo; (Note also that this is a reference to the Trinity, since the New Testament refers to the Holy Spirit as the Counselor.) Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28. Paul says of Christ in Titus 2:13, &ldquo;looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus.&rdquo; For the same reasons mentioned above, if one denies that Jesus is God, he is, by definition, not a Christian.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

As a result, many men and women&nbsp;live in quiet desperation, struggling with temptation while desiring counsel.</p>\n\n<p>Many Christians are&nbsp;taught from a young age that masturbation is wrong and sinful, especially since the act is&nbsp;typically associated with lustful thoughts or pornographic images. When <span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">we turn to our Bibles for counsel on this topic, however, we&#39;re likely to be surprised. Scripture is utterly silent on the specific topic of masturbation. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">This forces us to&nbsp;ask&nbsp;if the Lord considered&nbsp;masturbation a sin in all cases, why doesn&#39;t&nbsp;His word clearly speak against it, especially since the behavior is so common in the human experience?&nbsp;In fact, virtually <em>every</em> human sexual practice is mentioned somewhere in scripture (even bestiality!), yet absolutely nothing is said about masturbation. (A supposed case of masturbation often cited&nbsp;in the story of Tamar and Onan in Genesis 38:9 is an example of </span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">coitus interruptus, </em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">not masturbation.)</span></p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the absence of any specific biblical mention of masturbation in the Bible (much less an injunction against the practice) forces us to consider the possibility&nbsp;that God&#39;s children enjoy a certain degree of personal liberty in this area, though not without significant restraints and cautions. As we contemplate the possibility that a Christian possess a degree of&nbsp;liberty to practice masturbation, we first must distinguish between the sexual act itself and the thoughts and motivations that lie behind the act.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Any&nbsp;physical act can be&nbsp;good or evil,&nbsp;depending on our heart&#39;s intent. In the&nbsp;case of masturbation, the sexual act itself is a natural function of the human body, neither inherently good or evil. Theoretically, masturbation can be used in a&nbsp;healthy, loving way as part of marriage&nbsp;or in an immoral, sinful way to satisfy fleshly lust.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The difference between good actions and sinful actions depends on our motivations and our circumstances. According to the Bible, sexual activity is a physical expression of love reserved for the marriage bed.&nbsp;In the context of marriage, virtually any sexual act is permissible, provided it is performed with the consent of and for the love of our spouse.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if we engage in a sexual act apart from marriage or in a way that hurts our spouse, we sin. Even the sexual act of masturbation can be acceptable within the context of marriage provided our spouse has agreed to allow the practice, and it furthers the love of the marriage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Numerous&nbsp;examples of masturbation as a healthy and acceptable practice within a marriage exist,&nbsp;including as a substitute for intimacy when separated from a spouse, as an act intended to stimulate greater sexual attraction within the marriage, or as a release to calm a husband&#39;s or wife&#39;s sexual urge when the spouse is physically incapable of intimacy. In all cases, the act must be done with the full knowledge and consent of the spouse, so that every sexual act within the marriage is shared knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Still, a Christian must appreciate the dangers of this practice, especially if it becomes routine. Jesus declared that impure sexual thoughts are equal to improper behavior (Matt 5:28) and that sin lives in our hearts long before it manifests itself outwardly in our actions. Therefore,&nbsp;by the time we entertain a desire to do the wrong thing, we have already sinned in our hearts, and therefore&nbsp;we must give careful consideration to whether indulging in masturbation, even in the context of marriage, will invite unwelcome, sinful thoughts or lead to other sinful behaviors.</p>\n\n<p>For example, it may be difficult for a husband or wife to masturbate without entertaining inappropriate thoughts or relying on pornographic images. The practice may become all-consuming, leading to secrecy and deception within the marriage. Spouses who engage in masturbation regularly may become dependent on self-gratification to the exclusion of intimacy with the spouse.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, over-reliance on self-gratification leads to the need for greater levels of stimulation to achieve sexual satisfaction, leading to sexual disfunction in the marriage and other,&nbsp;self-destructive behaviors or sexual temptations. All of these outcomes are the consequences of sinful, selfish choices, illustrating the truth that although masturbation can be acceptable in some situations, it also has the potential to produce unintended and&nbsp;outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>For any Christian struggling with unhealthy&nbsp;reliance on self-gratification, the best remedy is personal prayer combined with seeking counsel and accountability from godly, caring Christian friends and leaders. The negative impacts of sexual sin can be long-lasting and far-reaching, and we should not underestimate the challenge of confronting the practice and healing the wounds it leaves behind. If you are experiencing such a struggle, we strongly encourage you to seek godly counsel together with your spouse (if you&#39;re married).&nbsp;</p>"

In answer to your question, we need not side-step the clear teaching of Scripture: homosexual behavior is a form of sexual sin and is not compatible with a position of leadership in any congregation. Numerous Scriptures teach this fundamental truth, but as an example, Paul lists homosexual behavior among many serious perversions and sins when he writes to Timothy:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>1Tim. 1:8 &nbsp;But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,<br />\n1Tim. 1:9 realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers<br />\n1Tim. 1:10 and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching,<br />\n1Tim. 1:11 according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.</h5>\n\n<p><br />\nPaul list homosexual sin as contrary to sound teaching, and Paul includes homosexual behavior among other serious sins to reflect how seriously God views this form of rebellion against His natural order. Any church congregation that condones homosexuality - much less elevates its practitioners into positions of leadership - is itself in rebellion to God&#39;s word and to the Lord Himself.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we must differentiate between those who experience homosexual temptations from those who choose to give into their temptations and engage in homosexual behaviors. A Christian man or woman may experience homosexual temptations (i.e., feel a lustful attraction for someone of the same sex), but if they reject those temptations, then they have not sinned. This is the expectation the Bible places on all of us. If their homosexual desires persist, then they should choose to live a single life rather than giving into their desires and thereby live a godly life.</p>\n\n<p>Christians who live with heterosexual lust face a similar challenge. They must resist their desires to engage in inappropriate relationships with the opposite sex (i.e., fornication, adultery). The Bible teaches that the only form of sexual intimacy approved by God is in the context of a marriage between a man and woman. Christians fighting homosexual or inappropriate heterosexual desires deserve encouragement to continue in resisting sin.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, when we encounter someone claiming the faith and trying to redefine their homosexual lusts as \"normal\" so that they can indulge in their sin without conviction, they should be corrected and disciplined within the Body of Christ for their own good. We are commanded by Christ to confront sin within the Body of Christ (in a loving way), and challenge each other to resist sin in our lives. This is not a form of \"judging\" but a Biblically appropriate response to sin.</p>\n\n<p>Please read a longer treatment of this issue in our article <em><a href=\"/bible-answers/is_it_ok_to_be_homosexual_and_a_christian\">Can a Believer be Homosexual</a></em>?<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

In the words of Paul, all things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. By this we mean that the Bible doesn&#39;t prescribe a specific style of music (or any music at all) as part of our worship of God. Instead, the Bible teaches we are to worship in Spirit and Truth (John 4:23-24). Specifically, we are called to worship by allowing the Spirit of God to direct our attention and needs toward God in all that we say and do, and we are to conduct our worship focused on the teaching of and preaching of God&#39;s word.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, if we choose to use \"worldly\" music in our worship services, we must be careful to select music that adheres to these requirements. The words we sing must reflect the leading of the Spirit and reiterate truths found in God&#39;s word without being trivial or offensive. Obviously, it will be difficult to find worldly music that meets these requirements, but when we do, such music could be a useful part of worship.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe content of the words is the key issue in deciding whether music is acceptable for worship, but virtually any musical style could be acceptable so long as it supports these same two expectations. Today we can find many worship songs using Biblically-based lyrics set to contemporary musical arrangements. We can still find traditional hymns in many churches as well. The style of music is not a principle concern in the course of worship, but the words we use and the effect it has on our ability to worship are very important.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

The simplest answer to your question is that you should follow the Spirit as He directs you to the gathering of believers He has selected for you. Obviously, the difficulty can be in discerning the Spirit&#39;s leading, so there are some basic factors you should consider.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, remember that you are a part of THE Church no matter where you congregate. A Christian is called to minister as a way of life, and attending a once-a-week event on Sunday mornings is not the equivalent to performing our Christian duty nor growing in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ. Hopefully, our weekly attendance will serve as a means to those ends, but it&#39;s rarely enough by itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo even as you search for a church home, we encourage you to maintain an open mind for how the Spirit may call you to participate in ministry. For example, our principle teacher, Pastor Armstrong, teaches in three different churches each week. Other members of our staff and Board of Directors attend different churches from one SUnday to the next - or no church at all some weeks. In general, we believe the Bible calls us to maintain a focus on serving the body of Christ wherever God directs without limiting our service to a single building to the exclusion of all other opportunities to minister.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, we understand the desire to find one church that can serve as your home church, and we can offer some simple advice on narrowing your choices. First, every church body is called to worship in Spirit and Truth (John 4:23), so look for a church where teaching through the Bible is a consistent, prominent part of the worship service and where reliance on the Spirit&#39;s leading and the Lord&#39;s grace is valued.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, the service is to be conducted in an orderly, God-honoring way without games or gimmicks that detract from the purpose of the worship service.</p>\n<p>\n\tThird, look for elder leadership in the church and a pastor who participates within a plurality of leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, do your homework on their doctrines and beliefs. Ask the pastoral staff hard questions on points of doctrine, and if they can&#39;t (or won&#39;t) answer your questions forthrightly, move on.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

To answer your question, let&#39;s look at the full context of Jesus words in Matthew 5:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 5:17 &ldquo;Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.<br />\n\tMatt. 5:18 &ldquo;For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.<br />\n\tMatt. 5:19 &ldquo;Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br />\n\tMatt. 5:20 &ldquo;For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.</h5>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tJesus is speaking to the crowd in response to the Pharisees&#39; accusation that Jesus was trying to abolish the Law of God. Jesus refuted this accusation, saying that His purpose in appearing before men was not to abolish anything. Rather, Jesus came to fulfill the Law. The word fulfill in Greek is pleroo, which is also translated \"to complete.\" In other words, Jesus came to complete or accomplish the entire Law.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe goes on to say that heaven and earth will not pass away until the entire Law of God has been accomplished. Jesus is the One Who accomplishes God&#39;s Law by keeping the entire Law perfectly. Jesus never sinned during His earthly life, and so as He went to His death on the cross, He had accomplished or completed all the requirements of God&#39;s Law. Jesus was referring to His completing of the Law when on the cross He said, \"It is finished.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Pharisees were accusing Jesus of setting the Law aside, while they endeavored to keep it in their own power. Jesus condemned the Pharisees and anyone else who tried to follow their example by saying that unless they could keep the Law even better than the Pharisees kept it, they could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. This was a daunting challenge, because the Pharisees were scrupulous followers of the Law. If the Pharisees didn&#39;t have enough righteousness on their own to enter Heaven, then who could?</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, Jesus was alluding to that answer. No one can earn their way into Heaven, because no one is righteous enough to make it through works. This is precisely why Jesus came to fulfill the Law on our behalf, so that His perfect work could be credited to us on the basis of faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow that the Law has been completed by Jesus on our behalf, we are no longer obligated to keep it ourselves. That is not to suggest that the Law itself has gone away, but only that our obligations to keep it is gone, because Jesus has already kept (i.e., fulfilled, completed, accomplished) it for us. Likewise, anyone who discounts the importance of God&#39;s Word will suffer loss.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus is the One Who kept and taught the Law, and as a result, Jesus will be the One Who is called great in the Kingdom of Heaven (Matt 5:19). We should not teach believers to follow the Law out of obligation, but neither should we teach that the Law is no longer in force. Rather, we teach that the Law has been fulfilled by Christ&#39;s work, and we rest in His perfect accomplishment of the Law rather than in our own futile efforts to keep it.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

I&#39;m concerned that your ministry teaches from newer translations, which are not accurate. Why don&#39;t you use the KJV Bible?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Verse By Verse Ministry is not especially dedicated to any one English version, though we have chosen one version (the New American Standard Bible) for our teaching simply as a matter of consistency. In general, we prefer to use modern English translations, because we believe the modern translations rely on the better Greek and Hebrew manuscripts and because we see no advantage in teaching using a style of English unfamiliar to our audience. We do refer to older translations like the KJV in our studies on occasion, and we appreciate their strengths.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the differences between English translations, there are two groups of English Bible translations available today, broadly speaking. Apart from style differences, these two groups differ by which ancient manuscripts they used. The first group includes the KJV, the Young Bible, the Douay-Rheims Bible, and several other older translations. Group 1 chose to use later Greek texts for their translations, and these manuscripts occasionally include additions to the text not found in the earliest Greek manuscripts.</p>\n\n<p>The second group of English translations include the NASB, NIV, HCSB, ASV, NET, BBE, the Darby Bible, ESVS and others. Group 2&#39;s translations are based on the oldest surviving Greek manuscripts. These manuscripts generally lack the additions found in the later manuscripts used by Group 1.</p>\n\n<p>Scholars debate whether the additional material in the later manuscripts were \"recovered truth\" wrongly deleted from the earlier manuscripts or were unauthorized additions made to Scripture at a later date. In our view, it is unlikely that later manuscripts \"recovered\" lost information, and therefore we believe the older manuscripts provide the most accurate possible translation. Therefore,&nbsp;VBVMI prefers to teach form Bible translations from Group 2 (e.g., the NASB, HCSB, etc.).</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Nevertheless, the differences between the two groups are insignificant at best</em></strong>, and a Bible student will not be harmed in their study and understanding of God&#39;s word by choosing any Bible from either of the groups. Unless a student is capable of reading and understanding ancient Greek and Hebrew, they have no choice but to rely on imperfect English translations (and all translations are imperfect by definition). Still,&nbsp;they may do so in the confidence that the Spirit will guide them to all truth and righteousness regardless of the imperfections in their translation (<em>see John 14:26</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we should not think too highly of any particular English Bible translation, much less consider one to be \"authoritative.\" There simply is no such thing as an authoritative English translation, since all translations are derivative works at best. Only the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts are authoritative and inerrant. Therefore, we should make a habit of consulting multiple translations to learn the original meaning of the text, while we&nbsp;trust the Holy Spirit to teach us God&#39;s truth regardless of which translation we might use.</p>\n\n<p>(On the topic of Bible accuracy, you might appreciate the following <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/how_do_we_know_the_bible_is_accurate/)\"><strong>article</strong></a> we have available on the website.)</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>In Mark 16:16&nbsp;Jesus declares, \"He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned.\" Does this mean that water baptism is a requirement for salvation?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Regarding Mark 16:16, this is an often misunderstood verse in the Bible. As you indicated, some have taken this verse to mean water baptism is required for salvation, thus establishing a human work as a prerequisite for salvation. Obviously, declaring any human work to be a necessary requirement for salvation would contradict the clear and consistent teaching of the New Testament, perhaps best summed up by Paul in Romans:</p>\n\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px; \">&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px; \"><strong>Rom. 4:5: But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness<br />\n<br />\nRom. 10:9-10:&nbsp; that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.</strong></h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If in Mark 16:16 Jesus had intended to make water baptism a requirement for salvation, then He would have been contradicting the entire testimony of Scripture, and we know that God never contradicts Himself (1Sam 15:29).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Baptism\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/sikakanebaptism.jpg\" style=\"margin: 5px 0px 5px 10px; float: right;\" width=\"263\" />Fortunately, there is no contradiction, because Mark 16:16 does not teach that you must receive <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">water</span> baptism to be saved. Instead, Jesus was saying that faith and the baptism of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Holy Spirit</span> is necessary for salvation. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the moment of regeneration within the spirit of every believer that accompanies (and enables) a true faith.</p>\n\n<p>It is impossible to believe the Gospel and be saved without the baptism of the Holy Spirit, which occurs in the moment the Holy Spirit indwells a new believer.</p>\n\n<p>We can read about the baptism of the Holy Spirit in many passages in the New Testament. For example, John the Baptist talks of the coming baptism of the Holy Spirit in Mark 1:8 and John 1:33. Jesus talks about it in Mark 10:38-39 and again after His resurrection in Acts 1:5. Peter talks about this new baptism in Acts 11:16.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Paul talks about this baptism in Rom 6:3-4, 1Cor 12:13, Gal 3:27, Eph 4:5, and Col 2:12. These are all references to the saving work done by the Holy Spirit in the heart of every believer, which we call the \"baptism of the Holy Spirit\" or sometimes just \"baptism.\"</p>\n\n<p>Remember, water baptism is merely a sign of something greater. Paul teaches in 1Cor 15 that water baptism is a picture of how we died with Christ through the baptism of the Holy Spirit and how we will rise again with Him one day.</p>\n\n<p>When we experience water baptism by going under the surface of the water, we picture our spiritual death through Christ&#39;s death on the cross (<em>i.e</em>., going down into the grave with Christ). When we come up out of the water, we picture our future resurrection in Christ. Therefore, the act of water baptism is an outward sign of the inward change accomplished by the baptism of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Interesting, both Peter and Paul make clear that water baptism is NOT a requirement for salvation in their letters.&nbsp; First, Paul says explicitly that Jesus did NOT send him to water baptize people, but instead to preach the Gospel for the salvation of men (1Cor 1:17).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If water baptism were required for salvation, wouldn&#39;t we expect Paul to make the opposite claim in 1Cor 1:17? Wouldn&#39;t Paul have emphasized that he performed water baptism on many believers, since it was essential to their salvation? Instead, Paul says he&#39;s glad he <em><strong>didn&#39;t</strong></em> baptize many with water. Clearly, Paul did <em><strong>not</strong></em> think water baptism was a means to salvation, and his words in 1Corinthians indicate that water baptism can be <em>overemphasized</em> in an inappropriate way.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, consider Paul&#39;s own conversion and water baptism. In Acts 9 we find that as Paul arrives in Ananias&#39; house, we&#39;re told Paul had been saved and appointed to become Jesus&#39; instrument to bring the Gospel to the Gentiles. At that point, Paul had yet to be water baptized, yet Scripture says he was already saved. Obviously in Paul&#39;s own conversion, salvation occurred before his water baptism.</p>\n\n<p>Next, Peter says in 1Pet 3:21 that water baptism (\"the removal of dirt from the flesh\") is not what saves a person, but rather men are saved by an appeal to God for a good conscience.&nbsp; Such an appeal is made possible by the baptism of the Holy Spirit (1Cor 12:3).&nbsp; We could translate Peter&#39;s words this way: \"...baptism saves you - not water baptism but the baptism of the Holy Spirit.\"</p>\n\n<p>Finally, consider these three reasons for why we know water baptism is not a prerequisite to salvation:</p>\n\n<p>1. The thief on the cross was declared saved by Christ, yet we know the thief never experienced water baptism before he died. If even one man can go to heaven without water baptism, then it disproves the teaching that Mark 16:16 makes water baptism a requirement for salvation.</p>\n\n<p>2. The OT saints like Abraham never experienced any form of water baptism, yet the Bible tells us they were saved. In fact, they were saved in the same way we are saved: by faith alone. Paul clearly and specifically teaches in Romans 4 that Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness.&nbsp;Abraham was declared righteous (i.e., saved) by faith without any requirement for water baptism. Again, if the OT saints could be saved by faith without the requirement for water baptism, then we can know that Mark 16:16 is not teaching that water baptism is a requirement for salvation.</p>\n\n<p>3. In Acts 10, Peter declares that the church leadership shouldn&#39;t withhold the opportunity for water baptism from Gentiles who had already received the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:47). Elsewhere, Paul tells us that the definition of a true Christian is anyone who is indwelled by the Holy Spirit (Rom 8:14).&nbsp;Therefore, according to Peter the Gentiles in Acts 10 were already indwelled by the Holy Spirit, which means they were already Christians - and yet they had not received water baptism at that point. Here again, we see clearly that water baptism is not a prerequisite for salvation.</p>\n\n<p>There are many other examples like these in the Bible that prove that water baptism is not the essential requirement for salvation. Salvation is by faith alone in Jesus Christ, and this salvation is not by works so that no man may boast (Eph 2:8-9).&nbsp; This is truly Good News!</p>\n\n<p>So why do we receive water baptism? Jesus commanded that every believer receive this sacrament as an outward sign of our changed heart (Matthew 28:18-20). Receiving water baptism is an important step of obedience that welcomes us into the family of God and readies us to follow the Lord with our whole heart. It forms our first - and best - testimony of our faith in Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Since water baptism is the first act command of every believer by our Lord Christ, we should not underestimate the importance of our obdience. When a believer knowingly rejects water baptism, they rebel against the word of God and against the Lord Who saved them, and they risk beginning a life of disobedience in the faith with eternal consequences. Remember the words of the writer of Hebrews:</p>\n\n<h5><strong>Heb. 3:12&nbsp; Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart&nbsp; that falls away from&nbsp; the living God.<br />\nHeb. 3:13 &nbsp;But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called &ldquo;Today,&rdquo; so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</strong></h5>\n\n<h5><strong>Heb. 10:28&nbsp; Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.<br />\nHeb. 10:29&nbsp; How much severer punishment do you think he will deserve&nbsp; who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as unclean&nbsp; the blood of the covenant&nbsp; by which he was sanctified, and has&nbsp; insulted the Spirit of grace?<br />\nHeb. 10:30 For we know Him who said, &ldquo; VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo; THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE.&rdquo;<br />\nHeb. 10:31 It is a&nbsp; terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the&nbsp; living God.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>The writer warns believers to consider the consequences of disobeying the living God by rejecting His commands. They are terrifying indeed. Furthermore, the church is called as a last resort to discipline those who willfully disobey the Lord by cutting of fellowship in the church, so to those who refuse water baptism, the result is that the church must cut them off from fellowship.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\tBy way of introduction, these verses are classic Pauline soteriology, and they establish a bedrock of truth upon which rests everything we can know about how we are saved and why we are saved. While these verses don&#39;t present everything we can know on these matters (see Romans 1-8 and 1Cor 1-2, for example), they do establish a foundation of truth that every Christian must understand if they wish to grasp the full meaning of the word \"grace.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking at the passage verse-by-verse:</p>\n<p>\n\tIn verses 1-3 Paul reminds the church in Ephesus of their former spiritual state prior to coming to faith in Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t<strong>Eph. 2:1 &nbsp;And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,<br />\n\tEph. 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.<br />\n\tEph. 2:3 Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.</strong></h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tNotice the details:</p>\n<p>\n\t1. They were dead in sin</p>\n<p>\n\tThe word for dead in Greek is nekros, which literally means a corpse or dead body. Since we know Paul is talking about a spiritual state (not a physical state), we must understand this deadness refers to our spiritual life. The Ephesians were alive physically but dead spiritually. Paul chose this comparison because it accurately describes not only the nature of an unbeliever but also the impossibility of an unbeliever recognizing and correcting his own condition. Just as a corpse cannot revive itself to life, neither can an unbeliever revive his own spirit into new life.</p>\n<p>\n\t2. This state of spiritual deadness is according to the course of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe word \"course\" in Greek is aion, which literally means age or a space of time. So, Paul explains that the natural state of every man and woman during this age or time is to be spiritually dead. This is normal and universal. We know from Romans and Genesis, that the cause for humanity&#39;s dead state is the sin of Adam, which we inherited at birth.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul is explaining that the Ephesians&#39; spiritual deadness prior to faith was not unique. They simply shared in a condition that affects all humanity. Every person begins their life on earth in a state of spiritual deadness, and apart from a work of God to revive our spirit, this state will continue uninterrupted until our physical death.</p>\n<p>\n\t3. This state is according to the prince of the power of the air, who is now working among the unbelieving world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpiritual deadness is a condition which finds its source in Satan. He was the first to fall, and his deceptive influence contributed to the fall of Man in the Garden. Today, he rules the hearts of those bound in spiritual deadness, and he exerts his controlling influence through the fear of death (see Heb 2:14-15). In short, all unbelievers are spiritually dead sons and slaves of the devil.</p>\n<p>\n\t4. We were once among them, following after our flesh and living according to this dead nature.</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery Christian should understand their former state to be the same as every other unbeliever. No one is \"born\" a Christian. Every human being is a sinner, dead in their trespasses from birth. All humanity shares the same starting point as children of (God&#39;s) wrath.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom this opening, Paul sets the stage to explain why and how we were saved from this state of spiritual deadness. In the process, his gives us the Biblical definition of grace itself. See verses 4-7:</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t<strong>Eph. 2:4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,<br />\n\tEph. 2:5 even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ ( by grace you have been saved),<br />\n\tEph. 2:6 and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,<br />\n\tEph. 2:7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</strong></h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn verse 4, Paul now presents why we were rescued from this state of deadness: because God was rich in mercy and had a great love for us, He acted to save us. By itself, this statement negates any consideration of works. God&#39;s reason for saving us was entirely His own. Being rich in mercy and having a great love, God determined to save us. We did not merit His mercy, nor did we earn our salvation.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn verse 5, Paul moves to explaining how we were rescued from our dead spiritual state. Notice Paul begins by reminding us that \"even when we were dead...\" God made us (spiritually ) alive in Christ. The Bible is utterly clear on the sequence of events that lead to our salvation: God must act first, because men do not naturally seek God (see Romans 3:10-11). God must act first on our behalf, because dead corpses are not capable of reviving themselves. The Greek verb construction credits God with all action required to bring about the result. We share none of the action with God. By Himself and according to His own purpose and while we were still yet unaware of Him, He made us alive.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn verse 6, Paul completes the discussion of how we were saved by adding that our new spiritual life resulted in us being raised with Christ to be seated in heavenly places. Though we are presently located on earth physically, nevertheless we have been assigned a place spiritually at the right hand of the Father in Christ. Paul&#39;s point is that our salvation should not be appreciated as merely a change in status or intellectual thought (i.e., being saved isn&#39;t merely a matter of agreeing with the Gospel).</p>\n<p>\n\tRather, salvation it is a change of spiritual position before God. By His work, we have been moved, spiritually speaking, from our prior position as sons of the devil dead in sin to our new state as sons of God alive in Christ. According to this truth we must conclude that our new spiritual state is not reversible, because nothing can tear us away from Christ (and Paul says we are now seated \"with Christ\").</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, in verse 7 Paul returns to finish explaining why God saved us. He appointed us to salvation so that He might display the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness to us. In effect, we are His appointed audience to receive His grace and kindness, so that in the ages to come we may glorify Him for it.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t<strong>Eph. 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;<br />\n\tEph. 2:9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.<br />\n\tEph. 2:10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them</strong>.</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul sums up his teaching in this passage with the classic definition of grace.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn verse 8, Paul says we were saved by grace. Grace is unmerited favor, and as Paul has already explained, it answers the question \"why\" we were saved. The answer is God showed us unmerited favor.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext, Paul says the grace of God was manifested by faith. When the time came for God to bring us His grace, He delivered it through faith. It&#39;s important to understand what Paul is saying here. Paul has placed these terms in a specific order. Our faith was not the means by which we received grace. Instead, grace was the means by which we received faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul goes further in verse 8 to ensure we do not confuse his point. Paul says \"it\" (i.e., faith) was not of ourselves. We did not leave our state of spiritual deadness and come to believe God&#39;s word by our own efforts. Dead corpses cannot raise themselves. Instead, the faith we received was a gift of God (hence, it was grace). The moment a person is born again and moves from the kingdom of darkness and enters into the light of the truth of the Gospel, they do so because God, by grace, bestowed the gift of faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul further clarifies that God&#39;s manner of salvation precludes any possibility that our newfound state could be attributed to human works. Since our very faith is itself a gift of God, we must acknowledge that we are God&#39;s workmanship. Furthermore, God&#39;s work presupposes a purpose, and the purpose for His acting is so that we might do good works. As Jesus Himself said in Matt 5:16:</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t<strong>Matt. 5:16 &ldquo;Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</strong></h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tOur good works will display the handiwork of God. They do not produce our salvation; they result from our salvation.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, Paul says that even our good works were prepared beforehand by God. When we endeavor to please God by our works, we must accomplish the work He has appointed for us. If we accomplish other work of our own choosing, we labor in our flesh and we do not please the Lord. Therefore, only those works He has purposed beforehand for us constitute \"good works\" done in faith.&nbsp;</p>"

Worshipping in both song and dance is a Biblically appropriate way to praise our Lord. &nbsp;For example, David is famous for dancing while praising the Lord (see 1Sam 30:16; 2Sam 6:14-16). &nbsp;Later David wrote of praising the Lord in dance in the Psalms, including Psa 30:11; 149:3; 150:4.&nbsp;Also, the prophet Jeremiah foretells of a time when the nation of Israel will be restored to their land under the New Covenant, and they will respond by praising the Lord in dances (Jer 31:4, 13).</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/Praise Dance.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; float: right; width: 189px; height: 300px; \" />On the other hand, the fact that dancing in praise is Biblical doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that all dancing during worship is appropriate. To borrow from Solomon (Eccl 3:4), there is a time for dancing and there are also times to remain still. &nbsp;When a person wishes to engage in dance during a worship service, their behavior must be guided by love and according to three general Biblical principles.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, the incorporation of dance into a worship service must be done with consideration given to the need for good order in the worship service. Paul teaches clearly in 1Cor 14 that group participation in the worship service is to be encouraged, but he also cautions that the service must be in done in an orderly manner (v.40). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the introduction of dancing brings a degree of disorder or disharmony in the body (i.e., disrupts the service or impedes worship for others), then it should be rejected as inappropriate. &nbsp;Under these circumstances, dancing is inappropriate not because it is wrong in itself but because in the way it is practiced, it is not edifying.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, the practice of dancing during worship must be approved by the elders of the church. No two church gatherings are exactly the same, and the Spirit will lead different congregations to adopt different expressions in worship. &nbsp;Consequently, dancing in worship will better fit some cultures than others, and it falls to the church leaders (i.e., the elders) to determine which practices are best suited to a particular congregation. In the end, Christians are expected to be in submission to their leaders (Heb 13:17).</p>\n<p>\n\tShould the leadership of a particular church prohibit dancing, the congregation should respect that judgment. Similarly, where dancing is permitted the congregation should accept the practice. If someone insists on dancing during worship against the elders&#39; wishes, their worship is fruitless since it is an act of disobedience against the church leadership and therefore&nbsp;cannot please the Lord.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, dancing in praise must be done with a heart to see God receive glory and praise rather than for the purpose of receiving attention.&nbsp;Someone with a sincere heart to praise God&nbsp;through dance won&#39;t seek the attention of a crowd, nor will the person demand a prominent place in the gathering. &nbsp;Such a person will be just as happy to dance in a back corner of the sanctuary as on the front stage. &nbsp;If a person desires attention for themselves through this spectacle, then they have ceased praising God truly and are seeking praise for themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tBased on these three principles, we advise churches considering praise dancing to consider the following conditions:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>1. The church leadership should pray concerning this activity and be confident that it is the Holy Spirit&#39;s direction to introduce dancing into congregational worship. &nbsp;The introduction of dance should be a purposely, thoughtful, prayerful decision on the part of the leadership.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>2. The congregation should be given a choice of attending another service without dancing to ensure that those who are distracted by the practice have opportunity to praise the Lord without impediment.</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>3. Dancing should be limited to a prescribed manner and time during worship, and it should be confined to a limited area of the room, preferably at the rear of the sanctuary to ensure the dancers don&#39;t receive undue attention or disrupt the order of the service.</em></p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Are all the promises given in Scripture applicable to all believers or only some?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The short answer is no, not all promises in the Bible are applicable to believers. In fact, many promises in the Bible are not applicable to believers at all. When God makes a promises in His word, we must examine who He spoke to and what He said before we can know whether those promises will apply to all believers or to a specific group of believers.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll Scripture is useful for instruction and training, as Paul says, and therefore all Scripture has been written for our benefit. On the other hand, that doesn&#39;t mean every statement of Scripture is true for us. For example, God spoke specific promises to Abraham at several places in the book of Genesis. God promised to give Abraham a son, and to produce a nation from Abraham&#39;s seed, and to give Abraham a land and a name. These promises were given specifically to Abraham, and they are begin fulfilled through the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>\n\tProper use of scripture requires that we interpret those verses in their context, which means they were promises spoken to Abraham and to his descendants. God&#39;s promises included blessing many nations (Gen 22:18) through Abraham, so we know we may receive the fruit of those promises, but that doesn&#39;t mean the promises are spoken to us. Consequently, we cannot claim that the promises spoken to Abraham were intended for all believers.</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, God spoke promises to the other patriarchs and to many kings of Israel including David, He spoke promises to Moses and the people of Israel, and He spoke promises to Israel&#39;s enemies. Are believers supposed to lay claim to all those promises? If you examine all the promises God has spoken in the Old Testament, there are many that we would never want to claim.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, God made promises of judgment to many peoples, usually to Israel&#39;s enemies. Many of these promises of judgment are found in the book of Isaiah, and after a careful study of that book, you would quickly conclude that God&#39;s promises are not necessarily intended to be applied to all believers (nor would you want them!).</p>\n<p>\n\tWhenever we see a promise in Scripture, always ask the following questions: Who did the speaking? Was it God speaking directly or through a prophet or Apostle? Who was receiving the promise? Was the promise given to a certain individual or group (e.g., the Israelites or the Apostles)? Who would benefit from the promise (e.g., just the hearer or others as well)?</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you answer these questions, you will find the Scripture&#39;s focus either narrowing or expanding. When it narrows, as in the case of Abraham or promises for judgment, then we shouldn&#39;t try to expand them. When the promises expand, as in the case of Jesus&#39; or Paul&#39;s teaching in the New Testament, then we should make an appropriate application for our own sake. Let the context of the Scriptures guide your interpretation.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. How should I understand Paul&#39;s teaching in 1Timothy 2:11-12 concerning women teaching men? Is it ever possible for a woman to teach a man?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. First, we recommend you read the following <a href=\"/resource_library/questions_and_answers/can_a_woman_teach_men_in_the_church/\" target=\"_self\" title=\"Women remaining silent\">article</a> on our website on a similar question.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Paul&#39;s teaching in 1Timothy gives us additional context to consider on this point. While in 1Cor 14 Paul was principally concerned with maintaining proper order in the church service, in 1Tim 2 he is concerned with believers maintaining a proper testimony in the world. In both passages, submission to authority is the essential prerequisite to obtaining the desired outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/shelagh.jpg\" style=\"width: 260px; height: 340px; float: right; margin: 5px 10px;\" />For example, in 1Cor 14, Paul teaches that women are to remain silent when men are teaching, because to do otherwise would be a sign of disrespect and evidence that they were unwilling to submit. Furthermore, in the case of the Corinthian church this behavior had contributed to a disorderly service.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In 1Tim 2, Paul says women may not teach or exercise authority over a man due to God&#39;s requirement for male headship within His Church. Here again the issue rests on the Biblical expectation that a woman submit willingly to male authority, in this case so that they may have a good testimony within the church.</p>\n\n<p>Based on Paul&#39;s teaching, the fundamental question arises, \"Can a woman ever teach men?\"</p>\n\n<p>First, remember Paul&#39;s key concern in 1Tim 2 is that a woman willingly submit to authority in keeping with Christ&#39;s decree. So, we arrive at the general principle that women may not hold teaching positions whenever these roles constitute a de facto expression of authority over men, including teaching roles that have responsibility for establishing the normative interpretation of Scripture for the sake of the congregation (i.e., senior pastor, teaching pastor, an elder, a prophet, a curriculum developer for men&#39;s studies, etc.).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Given this principle, we could identify several possible exceptions to this rule.&nbsp; First, women may teach other women or children, including boys who have not reached adulthood (as determined by the customs of that church), because such a role does not require nor imply assuming authority over men in the church.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, a women could teach men privately, as when a man reads a Bible study book written by a woman or when a woman teaches a couples Bible study in her home.</p>\n\n<p>In these cases, there is little possibility that her teaching role would be interpreted as an affront to male headship in her church, provided her teaching received the review and approval of church leaders to ensure proper headship is in place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it may be permissible under certain circumstances for a woman to teach men in a public setting. Though the safest interpretation of Scripture would conclude that this practice should never be permitted, theoretically a woman could teach men publicly in such a way that she conformed to Paul&#39;s teaching (i.e., by conducting her teaching in a way that clearly operated under the authority and headship of a man).</p>\n\n<p>For example, the woman could demonstrate her submission to authority by ensuring a male leader was present in the class, who acted as the official leader of the class. Likewise, a woman teacher could show submission to male headship by co-teaching with a male teacher over a class of students that included men. Here again, the male teacher should be clearly identified as the leader of the class and the authority over interpretation of the text.</p>\n\n<p>Even taking such precautions, many Bible students would conclude fairly that our last example pushes the boundaries of Paul&#39;s instructions and, therefore, shouldn&#39;t be permitted. We believe the Bible leaves some room for interpretation on this point (at least to the limits we&#39;ve outlined), so trust the Spirit to guide your own application.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In every situation, a woman teacher must be able to point to a male church leader who provides headship over her teaching. This male leader would hold final determination of the correct interpretation of Scripture, and he must answer to any concerns over her teaching. Obviously, male teachers should have similar accountability from other men.</p>\n\n<p>Every woman teacher should search her own heart to know whether she is willingly submitting to male headship in her church as she serves in her teaching gift. Ultimately, this is the test that the Lord will apply to her ministry at the judgment seat.</p>\n\n<p>You may also be interested in reading an <a href=\"/resource_library/questions_and_answers/must_women_remain_silent_in_church/\">answer</a> to a question concerning woman remaining silent in church.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. John&#39;s Gospel says that \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God...\" I don&#39;t understand the meaning of \"the Word?\" Is the \"Word\" a person? How can a word be God?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The prologue of John&#39;s gospel is an important work within the New Testament, because it provides perhaps the clearest statement of Who Jesus was in spiritual terms. Essentially, John&#39;s prologue states that Jesus was God, but it also seeks to explain, to a certain extent, the nature of Jesus&#39; existence and His role within the Godhead.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet&#39;s start by examining the opening verses in John&#39;s Gospel:</p>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px; \">\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px; \">\n\t<em>John 1:1&nbsp; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br />\n\tJohn 1:2&nbsp; He was in the beginning with God.<br />\n\tJohn 1:3&nbsp; All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.</em></h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn uses the Greek word <em>logos</em> to describe Jesus \"in the beginning,\" or before creation and time began. Logos means word, but specifically it means the spoken word or a statement. Jesus is God&#39;s spoken word, according to John.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn then explains that the Word (Jesus) was \"with\" God and \"was\" God. This statement yields two important conclusions regarding Jesus and the Trinity: Jesus is God and existed from the beginning as God, yet Jesus&#39; existence is somehow distinct from God the Father. Jesus was \"with\" God and \"was\" God at the same time. This is the mystery of the Trinity: all three Persons in the Godhead are One God and yet all are distinct from one another.</p>\n<p>\n\tMoving to verse 3, John says that it was the Word (Him) that created all things. From this statement, we begin to see why Jesus is called the \"Word\" by John. Consider these facts we learn from John&#39;s Gospel and elsewhere in Scripture:</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, we know from scripture that God the Father is Spirit (John 4:24), meaning He doesn&#39;t exist in physical form. So, there is no physical substance to God the Father. The Creation cannot experience the Father as He truly is, since we are bound to a physical dimension yet He is not physical.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, we know that God&#39;s Spirit is likewise invisible (John 3:6-8). He can only be known by observing His work in the Creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, Jesus is the member of the Godhead responsible for all physical matter. As John said, all things were made by and through Jesus. Paul says the same thing in Col 1:15-17.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tMore over, Paul teaches in Colossians that Jesus is the \"image of the invisible God.\" Therefore, He is the only Person in the Godhead Who has entered into and become a part of the physical creation. Jesus can be seen in a physical sense, because He is the One Who entered into the Creation and become a part of it (<em>i.e</em>., became incarnate).</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, Jesus is the One within the Trinity Who is associated with Creation, both as its source and as an ambassador of the Godhead to that creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext, consider how the Creation itself was established in Genesis 1. Genesis 1 teaches that the world was created by the spoken word of God (note the repeating phrase in Genesis 1, \"Then God said...\"). So when God the Father determined to created the universe and everything in it, He \"spoke\" it into existence. But as John said in verse 3, Jesus was the One who made all things, therefore we can say that Jesus was God&#39;s <em>logos</em>, or spoken Word.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can begin to understand this partnership (at least to some degree) by drawing an analogy to how our own thoughts and words reach into the physical word. When we desire to command something to happen in the world around us, we must first conceive the idea in our minds. No one can see our thoughts. They are invisible, yet they certainly exist. Without our thoughts, we could purpose to do nothing at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf our thoughts are to become visible in some way, they must move from the invisible realm of our mind and into the physical world. The progression from invisible to visible requires we transfer our invisible thoughts into a spoken command. The brain communicates our thoughts to our mouth where it becomes <em>logos</em>: spoken words.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce the spoken word leaves our mouth, it enters the physical world and yields its intended effect. This simple analogy helps explain how God the Father worked with God the Son (<em>i.e</em>., the Word) to establish Creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is John&#39;s meaning when he says that Jesus is the Word. He meant that Jesus is the physical manifestation of God the Father, just as a spoken word is the physical manifestation of our inner thoughts. Until Jesus took action and created the universe, there was no physical reality to God&#39;s presence. But when God \"spoke\" (<em>i.e.,</em> when Jesus took action), the Creation came into existence.</p>\n<p>\n\tLater, Jesus arrived in Person to meet with His creation, and as Jesus spoke His words to His disciples, He fulfilled the Father&#39;s purpose by providing a physical representation of the Godhead to His creation.&nbsp; Hebrews says it this way:</p>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px; \">\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px; \">\n\t<em>Heb. 1:1&nbsp; God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,<br />\n\tHeb. 1:2&nbsp; in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.<br />\n\tHeb. 1:3&nbsp; And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power...</em></h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul reiterates this same thought in Colossians when he says:</p>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px; \">\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5 style=\"padding-left: 30px; \">\n\t<em>Col. 1:15&nbsp; He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.<br />\n\tCol. 1:16&nbsp; For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities &mdash; all things have been created through Him and for Him. </em></h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus is the Word because He was the means through which the Father brought all physical reality into existence and because He is the One Who represents the Father&#39;s invisible nature and character to that creation. Just as your spoken word is the physical manifestation of your thoughts and personality, Jesus is the \"Word\" of the invisible God to His creation.</p>"

How does a personknow for sure that he is already born again according to what Jesus says?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Jesus Christ said to Nicodemus in John 3:3:</p>\n<h5>\n\tJesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAlso, the Lord through Peter said in 1Pet. 1:3</p>\n<h5>\n\tBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe phrase &ldquo;caused us to be born again\" is referring to the same spiritual new birth that Jesus spoke about in John 3. It is the spiritual renewal caused by the work of the Holy Spirit in the heart of a person so they may become a follower of Jesus Christ and join into the body of Christ, the Church. Being &ldquo;born again&rdquo; is also the same as becoming a &ldquo;new creation&rdquo; and becoming a &ldquo;new creature in Christ,\" as Paul describes it in 2Cor 5:17.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn short, being \"born again\" means receiving a new spirit through faith in Jesus Christ. All who believe in Jesus Christ as Savior have been born again. This new birth is necessary because until we have been born again, we are by nature opposed to God and unable and unwilling to know Him truly. The sinful nature of man was introduced through the sin of Adam in the Garden of Eden, as told in Genesis 2 and 3. In Genesis 2:16-17 we read:</p>\n<h5>\n\tThe LORD God commanded the man, saying, &ldquo;From any tree of the garden you may eat freely; but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.&rdquo;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe statement: &ldquo;you will surely die&rdquo; means to die spiritually. Due to Adam&#39;s sin, they died a spiritual death, which is not the same as dying physically. Physical death came later as the result of God&#39;s curse on the Earth and all things in it (see Genesis 3:17). Since Adam, every human ever born has come into the world sharing the same fallen nature inherited from Adam. We are all born spiritually dead (see Romans 3:10-18).</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus Christ was not born with the nature of Adam, because He was conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary&#39;s womb, so His nature was not sinful. He was the Word made flesh and dwelt among us. Though he was not under the penalty of death Himself, nevertheless He willingly died in our place to pay the penalty for our sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy our faith and trust in that sacrifice, we are given His Spirit and made new again spiritually - we are born again or spiritually reconnected to God. The Apostle John teaches how we might know that someone has truly come to be born again in 1John 2:3-6:</p>\n<h5>\n\tBy this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments. The one who says, &ldquo; I have come to know Him,&rdquo; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him: the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked.</h5>\n<p>\n\tJohn is not suggesting that the evidence of our new birth will be a perfect sinless life, since this is not possible for any man until we receive our new, sinless body at the resurrection of the saints (1Cor 15). Instead, John is explaining that the new birth will be accompanied by new thinking and new living, in conformance with Jesus&#39; word.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you have doubts as to whether you have understood and believed the Gospel (so as to be born again), please read this article on <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/about/how_can_i_go_to_heaven/\">How to Become a Christian</a></strong>.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. In various teachings you discuss how we have a sovereign God Who has every detail of life planned. If God has every detail of your life planned to the finest detail, where does our free will fit in?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The question of how God&#39;s sovereignty and man&#39;s will work together is challenging to any Bible student, but we can rest in what the Bible teaches and leave the rest to God. First, we know that the Bible never mentions man&#39;s \"free will.\" In fact the words never appear in Scripture, because the Bible teaches the opposite. The Bible teaches that men are born \"slaves\" to sin (Rom 6:17; Gal 4:8), which means we are incapable of moving beyond our sinful nature on our own. Furthermore, the Bible says that through faith God delivered us from sin and into a relationship with Christ, which Paul describes as slavery to Christ (Eph 6:6).</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, we have a will to make our own choices, but that will is not free in the full sense of that word. Our nature determines the choices we make, and we are only free to make choices consistent with our nature. As an unbeliever, we were slaves to a sin nature and we were unable to do or say or think anything that might please God (Heb 11:6). So we didn&#39;t have the will to live without sin, so in that sense we were not truly free. All unbelievers are without free will in the sense that they are all slaves to their sin (Rom 16:18).</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter being brought to faith by the Spirit, we were given a new nature that is no longer a slave to sin (Gal 4:7), but now we are slaves to Christ (Rom 6:18). Again, we have a degree of freedom to choose disobedience or obedience, but we are still Christ&#39;s regardless of our decisions, and as such God may use us however he desires. Though we are not necessarily conscience of God&#39;s direction in our lives, the Bible assures us that God&#39;s plan will play out in our life without fail (Job 14:1-5; Psa 37:23; Prov 16:9).</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, there is a role for our will in the course of God&#39;s plan for our life. Our willful obedience to the Lord is the basis for His awarding of eternal reward. Romans 12-16 discusses the importance of our obedience to the Lord as we make choices and decisions to follow the Spirit. Nevertheless, when we determine to accomplish good works for the Lord, we are still fulfilling God&#39;s purposes as He determined from the beginning of time (Eph 2:10).</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our will is important in how we obey Christ to please Him, but we can never see man&#39;s will as competing with or changing God&#39;s plan. We simply do not have that power within us.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe recommend consulting additional resources on this topic found on our website, including <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/bible_studies/the_sovereignty_of_god/\">The Sovereignty of God</a></strong>, a teaching series devoted to exploring God&#39;s sovereignty in the lives of men.

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Since God rested on the Seventh day of Creation (before the Law of Moses was even given), doesn&#39;t that mean all people including Christians are required to observe a Sabbath Day?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. In Genesis 2, we see God resting on the seventh day from the work of Creation, but the commandment for men to imitate God by observing a weekly a Sabbath rest was not instituted at that point. In fact, there is no record of any man in Scripture observing a Sabbath rest prior to the giving of the Law through Moses.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Sabbath was given to the nation of Israel as a perpetual observance (Ex 20:8-11) in the Law. According to the Law, the Sabbath occurs from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown (the seventh day of each week).&nbsp;To explain the meaning and importance of the Sabbath commandment, the Lord reminded Moses of the Lord&#39;s own rest on the seventh day of Creation. Nevertheless, the requirement for men to observe a Sabbath rest was not established by God until the Law was given to Israel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWe must acknowledge, therefore, that the Sabbath is a commandment for Jews alone according to the Law given at Mt. Sinai. Gentiles are not expected to keep a Sabbath, and there is no Sabbath commandment found in the New Testament for the New Covenant believer, whether Jew or gentile.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Sabbath day rest was a picture or shadow of Christ. Just as God did all the work of Creation and then rested, likewise He has done all the \"work\" necessary for our salvation, and therefore we now rest in Christ&#39;s work through His sinless life and death on the cross. This is why we can say that Christ has become our perpetual rest and thereby our true Sabbath. Today, a believer enjoys a spiritual Sabbath rest everyday as we rest in Christ&#39;s work perpetually (see Heb 4:10).</p>\n<p>\n\tFor any believer who has accepted Christ as His Savior, he now enjoys this Sabbath. He has ceased from his work in trying to achieve righteousness, and instead he may see every day as one to serve Him through the grace of the New Covenant. Therefore, he need not observe an earthly Sabbath, which merely pictured the greater spiritual Sabbath.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristians are under no obligation to observe a Sabbath day of physical rest nor any \"Sabbath\" ritual since the Sabbath commandment was given to Jews in the Mosaic Law and that law has been fulfilled in Christ on our behalf. We can now rest in His work through faith. Every believer enjoys the freedom that comes from this liberty, so you may use everyday of the week in any way you see fit in serving the Lord. You may chose to set one day aside for rest or none. No man is to be your judge concerning these things, since all believers are free to exercise any patterns for living they chose (Col. 2:16-17).</p>\n<p>\n\tWe encourage you to read more about observing a Sabbath day in the following <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/which_day_is_the_true_sabbath/\"><strong>article</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you would like to learn more about the Christian&#39;s relationship to the Law, please read our two-part article <strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/articles/on_law_and_liberty_part_1/\">On Law and Liberty</a></strong>.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Pastor Armstrong taught it was hard to evangelize certain other religions because thay think their good works get them to Heaven. Isn&#39;t it all up to God to determine who is saved? I am a little confused please help.</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. As your question implied, Scripture teaches that all men are born dead in sin, unable to truly seek God and forever opposed to Him by our nature. Only after God brings about a new spiritual birth will anyone respond in faith. In Romans Paul explains this Biblical reality in careful detail, and he teaches that grace is most clearly understood as the way God brings us to faith while we are lost in our sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis fact gives rise to numerous questions. For example, what place does evangelism play in bringing others to faith? Can we influence God&#39;s choice in bringing someone to faith? What purpose do our evangelistic efforts serve? Pastor Armstrong teaches on many of these points during the course of his Romans study, but we can summarize them for you here:</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, God is the Author and Perfecter of our faith (Heb 12:2), and as such, He alone is responsible for our salvation. Simply put, men are saved if (and when) God chooses to save them (Eph 2:8-9). Nevertheless, God has purposed to work through the efforts of men to spread the Gospel and bring others to know Him (Matt 28:19-20). The Great Commission is fundamentally an expression of how Christ will build His Church through the work of believers.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we accept these truths, we come to the conclusion that our participation in spreading the Gospel is intended for God&#39;s glory and for our own blessing, yet our participation in evangelism is not essential to God&#39;s purposes in saving men nor do we share any of His glory when we participate obediently in bringing others to faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tPastor Armstrong often uses an analogy of an Easter egg hunt to explain the relationship between God&#39;s sovereignty in salvation and our responsibility to spread the Gospel. In his analogy, Pastor Armstrong describes the unbeliever as an egg hidden in the world waiting for someone to discover it. The Bible says that God the Father sovereignly decides who will receive the Gospel, which may be compared to the way a parent decides how many eggs are available and where they are hidden in the yard.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur world is littered with hidden \"eggs\" (i.e., future believers) waiting to be found. We find them by obeying the Great Commission. The Father is constantly working by His Spirit in the world to prepare hearts to receive the Gospel, and these \"eggs\" are ours for the taking if we seek after them (John 4:35). Like a child who runs around the yard eagerly searching for eggs, we should work eagerly to fulfill Christ&#39;s commands so that we might have the opportunity to \"discover\" the next believer.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we come across a heart made ready by God&#39;s Spirit, we have found an egg, and we will see a positive response to the Gospel (John 6:44). Our enthusiasm to spread the Gospel should stem from our confidence that God has placed hearts in the world ready for the gospel, so we know if we look long enough, we will find success. In this sense, God&#39;s sovereignty in salvation is our reason TO evangelize (rather than an excuse NOT to seek the lost), because we have confidence that the \"eggs\" do exist somewhere.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the Easter egg hunt, the children don&#39;t determine how many eggs exist, but they can influence how many each child may collect. Likewise, we don&#39;t determine the souls to be saved by God&#39;s grace, but we can influence how many may believe through the diligent practice of our faith, and if we are faithful to seek after these \"eggs,\" we gain the praise and reward of our master for that faithful service.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo summarize, we actively participate in seeking the lost by proclaiming the good news of the Gospel and discipling the saved because our Lord commanded us to do so. We serve Him obediently in these ways in expectation of success because we know He has purposed to work through men to bring the lost to faith, and because we understanding we have opportunity to gain reward for our faithfulness. In the end however, the number who will be saved was determined by God&#39;s choice from the foundations of the earth (Eph 1:4).</p>\n<p>\n\tLastly, you raised a good point in questioning Pastor&#39;s Armstrong&#39;s comments regarding his difficulty evangelizing to certain groups. Fundamentally, you are correct that God may choose to save anyone, so no group is outside His will to bring them to faith. Pastor Armstrong didn&#39;t intend to suggest that any group is less able to be saved. On the other hand, it is Pastor Armstrong&#39;s experience that certain religious groups can be particularly resistant to the Gospel, which may be a reflection of God&#39;s desire to leave some in disobedience and ignorance.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, Verse By Verse Ministry is no less committed to delivering the Good News to every person possible, since we do not presume whom the Lord is prepared and willing to grant mercy. Pastor Armstrong continues to teach to any group in the hope that he might discover another \"egg\" there, and he thanks you for bringing this point to his attention. He intends to correct his presentation on this point in the future.</p>"

While Scripture does not explicitly answer this question, we can find helpful answers in well-known statements of theology, which are backed by Scripture. For example, the Westminster Confession answers your question as follows:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;What is the chief end of man? Man&rsquo;s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Confession cites the following as supporting Scriptures: Psalm 86; Isaiah 60:21; Romans 11:36; 1 Corinthians 6:20, 10:31; Revelation 4:11; Psalm 16:5-11; Psalm 144:15; Isaiah 12:2; Luke 2:10; Philippians 4:4; Revelation 21:3-4. We agree with the Confession here, and would add that we believe that God desires a relationship with man so He may be glorified (please refer to above Scriptures) and to allow Him to demonstrate all of His perfect attributes to an audience that can appreciate them. In the demonstration of God&rsquo;s character through these attributes, we come to know and glorify God.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, Jeremiah 9:23-24 says:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tThus says the LORD, \"Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a rich man boast of his riches; but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things,\" declares the LORD.</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tNotice that God desires us to understand and know Him, and part of this knowledge is in what He does and who He is. If we understand and know someone, we know what they are like, what kind of person they are. God likewise desires a close, intimate relationship with us whereby He can make Himself known.</p>\n<p>\n\tGod even endures the existence of sinful creatures who were prepared for destruction in order to demonstrate His power, wrath and justice. Romans 9:22-24 says:</p>\n<h5>\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tWhat if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory, even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, this also demonstrates His great love and mercy for us who are called.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, we see that God desires for us to know Him, to know His character, and to understand Him. We come to know Him as He reveals His personal attributes, including His love, mercy, grace, justice, and wrath. While we may not have a totally clear answer in this life as to why God created us, it&rsquo;s something to which we can look forward to asking Him in heaven. For our time on this earth, may our Lord God continue to empower us to bring Him glory and honor in everything we do. As we&rsquo;re commanded in 1 Corinthians 10:31:</p>\n<p>\n\tWhether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I just found out that my ancestors were Jewish. Is it possible that The LORD is leaving a remnant without them knowing it? Could a lot of people who think they&#39;re Gentile actually be Jewish and be part of the remnant?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The remnant of Israel is the \"believing\" and faithful element among all Jews. In the days prior to Christ, the remnant were best described by the Lord Himself in 1Kings 19, when He said to Elijah in 1Kings 19:18:</p>\n<p>\n\tYet I will leave 7,000 in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Elijah&#39;s day, those who had not \"bowed to Baal\" were the faithful remnant of Israel. They were the remnant because they held to God&#39;s Law and did not engage in the idol worship which dominated Israel in that day.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow that the Messiah has been revealed in Person of Jesus Christ, the faithful remnant of Israel will be those Jews who have come to know Jesus as Messiah and become part of the Church. Though these Jews are now joined with Gentiles in the Body of Christ, they are also Jews and therefore are the remnant. Paul speaks of the Jews who have come to faith in Christ as the remnant of Israel in Romans 11:5:</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God&rsquo;s gracious choice.</p>\n<p>\n\tWho then can be considered a part of this Jewish remnant? A Jew is anyone who is descended from Abraham, so the Israelites maintained scrupulously accurate genealogies to establish who was a Jew. These records were held in the Temple, but following the destruction of Israel&#39;s records in AD70, the Jews have determined who is Jew by the identity of the mother. Simply put, you are considered Jewish if your mother was Jewish. If a Jewish man marries a Gentile woman, then her children are no longer considered Jewish.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn your case, you would be considered Jewish (and hence a part of the remnant) if you had a Jewish mother and were a practicing (religiously orthodox) Jew prior to your conversion to Christianity. Otherwise, you are a Gentile despite having Jewish ancestors.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo the larger question of how the lost tribes of Israel are accounted in this day and in the future, we do not believe these tribes will be \"found\" among the Gentiles. The lost tribes continue to exist today among the practicing Jews of the world. Otherwise, they are no longer Jewish. Remember, a Jew must continue to marry within the Jewish nation to be considered Jewish and to remain eligible for the promises (Deut 7:1-12).</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead we believe these lost tribes are still scattered among the practicing Jews in the world, though they themselves may be unaware of their tribal affiliations. Once the Spirit begins to work with the Jewish people again during Tribulation, then the tribes will re-emerge again to create the 144,000 evangelists.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Which people who enter the Kingdom and reproduce to create the unbelievers of that time? Are they Gentiles or Jewish?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Taking all that we have in Scripture together from our Revelation and Isaiah studies, we come to the conclusion that there are believing Gentiles who live to the end of the Tribulation (i.e., the \"sheep\"), who then enter the Kingdom as natural men. As natural men, they can marry and reproduce just as natural men do today, and their children may or may not become believers themselves just as happens today.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis group of people are responsible for repopulating the Kingdom, and they are the source for the unbelieving armies of men who rise up against Christ at the end of Tribulation when Satan is let loose (Rev 20:7-8).</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also know that at the end of Tribulation, a separate group of orthodox Jews are brought to faith in Christ and form the remnant of Israel who is saved on the last day (i.e., Zech 12:10; Rom 11:25-27; Isa 59:20-60:4). We also know that in the Kingdom, the Jewish nation is described as consistently entirely of believers (i.e., Jer 31:34). So, the more difficult question is whether the Jewish nation also has natural men in it, who may reproduce and have children?</p>\n<p>\n\tLooking at one of the passage quoted above (Isa 59:20-21) and in Isaiah 68:18-23 we find references to descendants or offspring, leaving us to wonder whether the Jewish remnant that comes out of the Tribulation will also enter the Kingdom in natural bodies. In our Revelation teaching (recorded in 2005), Pastor Armstrong taught that the Jewish remnant that enters the Kingdom will receive new bodies during the 75-day interval, based on passages like that found in Isaiah 25 that seem to suggest the nation of Israel is entirely regenerated and not given to marriage and reproduction.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn recent years his teaching has stepped back from a firm commitment to this position, especially in light of passages in Isaiah 68 and elsewhere that suggest Jewish reproduction. Dr. Arnold Fruchtenbaum of Ariel Ministies believes that the Jewish remnant that enters the Kingdom from Tribulation are like the Gentile believers: they are natural men, and therefore they will reproduce. Unlike the Gentile believers, however, Fruchtenbaum believes that based on the promises found in Jeremiah 31:34 and elsewhere, every Jewish child is assured to come to faith during their lifetime, since God promised the nation they would have no unbelievers in the Kingdom.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, this is a difficult area of Old Testament prophecy, and depending on how you view the various texts in Isaiah, you may believe that either all Jewish are resurrected into a new, incorruptible form (and therefore can&#39;t reproduce), or you believe that some Jews enter the Kingdom in natural form and reproduce, but then all Jewish children become believers by the power of the Spirit. Our ministry is unsure of which is intended in Scripture, though we teach the former view as the more likely intent of Scripture overall.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, the book we discuss in the course in <em><strong><a href=\"http://arielc.org/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=AMC&amp;Product_Code=baf-fotm&amp;Category_Code=baf\">Footsteps of the Messiah</a></strong></em>.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Is it a sin to charge other Christians interest on money borrowed? Leviticus says charging 10% interest is a sin.</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. There are several places in Scripture where God speaks specifically about lending money and charging interest, including Leviticus. Here is a sample of what the Lord says in His word:</p>\n<h5>\n\tYou shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. You shall not afflict any widow or orphan. If you afflict him at all, and if he does cry out to Me, I will surely hear his cry; and My anger will be kindled, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless. If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you are not to act as a creditor to him; you shall not charge him interest. If you ever take your neighbor&#39;s cloak as a pledge, you are to return it to him before the sun sets, for that is his only covering; it is his cloak for his body. What else shall he sleep in? And it shall come about that when he cries out to Me, I will hear him, for I am gracious. (Exodus 22:21-27)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tNow in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you. Do not take usurious interest from him, but revere your God, that your countryman may live with you. You shall not give him your silver at interest, nor your food for gain. I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God. If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave&#39;s service. He shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee. He shall then go out from you, he and his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to the property of his forefathers. For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. You shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God. As for your male and female slaves whom you may have--you may acquire male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you. (Leviticus 25:35-44)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tYou shall not charge interest to your countrymen: interest on money, food, or anything that may be loaned at interest. You may charge interest to a foreigner, but to your countrymen you shall not charge interest, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you undertake in the land which you are about to enter to possess. (Deuteronomy 23:19-20)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tLORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy hill? He who walks with integrity, and works righteousness, And speaks truth in his heart. He does not slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor takes up a reproach against his friend; In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honors those who fear the LORD; He swears to his own hurt and does not change; He does not put out his money at interest, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent He who does these things will never be shaken. (Psalm 15:1-5)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tHe who increases his wealth by interest and usury Gathers it for him who is gracious to the poor. (Proverbs 28:8)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<h5>\n\tBut if a man is righteous and practices justice and righteousness, and does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor&#39;s wife or approach a woman during her menstrual period--if a man does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing, if he does not lend money on interest or take increase, if he keeps his hand from iniquity and executes true justice between man and man, if he walks in My statutes and My ordinances so as to deal faithfully--he is righteous and will surely live,\" declares the Lord GOD. (Ezekiel 18:5-9)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAnd in the New Testament we find:</p>\n<h5>\n\tBut his master answered and said to him, &#39;You wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed. Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest. (Matthew 25:26-27)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tFirst, as you can see, scripture does not give a specific number with respect to how much a person should charge for interest. Therefore, lending money at 10% would not necessarily be considered a sin under the Mosaic Law. Second, note that the commandment is that God&#39;s people not charge interest to one another. Charging interest to foreigners was acceptable (<em>see Exodus 22:25; Deuteronomy 23:19-20)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom the above passages, then, we see that lending money with interest to fellow Jews (&ldquo;countrymen&rdquo;) would be sinful for a Jew under the Mosaic Law, but lending interest to a foreigner would not be sinful.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Christians, however, we are not under the Mosaic Law. Rather, we are under the Law of Christ (1Corinthians 9:21; Galatians 6:2). While there is significant overlap in the Mosaic Law and the Law of Christ, there is no specific commandment in the New Testament for Christians to refrain from charging one another interest. Therefore, we cannot say on the authority of scripture that it is wrong or sinful to charge interest in a fair and legal manner, whether to another believer or to an unbeliever.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, when we look at the instructions concerning interest found in the Old Testament, we see God concerned with the plight of the poor, and particularly when the poor do not receive assistance from their brethren. If a poor Jew suffered a bad crop or became ill or suffered a financial loss, he might not have enough income to support himself or his family. Under those circumstances, he must turn to his countrymen for a loan to get him through a difficult time. If his Jewish brethren charged him interest on the loan, especially a usurious rate (i.e., a very high rate of interest), it would only hasten the poor Jew&#39;s to fall into poverty.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo God, in concern over such circumstances, gave the Law against charging interest for Jews, which can be seen most clearly in Leviticus 25:35-36:</p>\n<h5>\n\tNow in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you. Do not take usurious interest from him, but revere your God, that your countryman may live with you.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, Christians are called to assist our poorer brothers and sisters in Christ by being generous with what we have. Paul, writing to the Galatians about his mission to take the gospel to the Gentiles, says this:</p>\n<h5>\n\tThey [the apostles in Jerusalem] only asked us to remember the poor--the very thing I also was eager to do. (Galatians 2:10)<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAlso, James 2:1-13 probably gives us one of the best explanations as to why we should help our poor brother or sister in need.</p>\n<h5>\n\tMy brethren, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism. For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes, and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, \"You sit here in a good place,\" and you say to the poor man, \"You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,\" have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives? 5Listen, my beloved brethren: did not God choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him? But you have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court? Do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called? If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, \"YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF,\" you are doing well. But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all. For He who said, \"DO NOT COMMIT ADULTERY,\" also said, \"DO NOT COMMIT MURDER.\" Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty. For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tAs you can see, James tells us to fulfill the &ldquo;royal law,\" which he says is loving our neighbor as we love ourselves. By doing so, we are fulfilling the law of liberty (another name for the Law of Christ). This means we are to &ldquo;speak and act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty,\" which means we are to show mercy to our brothers and sisters in Christ. Note that our judgment will not be for condemnation (Romans 8:1), but for reward (1 Corinthians 3:10-15).</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile there is no prohibition in Scripture to charging interest (as even Jesus indicates in Matthew 25 above), we should always act with sensitivity and compassion when loaning money to people in desperate need. Generally speaking, a compassionate Christian should consider loaning money with low or no interest (or even making the loan a gift with no expectation of repayment) when circumstances warrant charity. Again, this is not to say we may never loan money and charge interest to a poor person, but we should look for ways to demonstrate charity and love to others (especially fellow believers) rather than look for ways to enrich ourselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus teaches this principle in the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37). In answering the question &ldquo;Who is my neighbor?\", Jesus taught that anyone who needs our help is our neighbor, and more importantly, Jesus showed us what loving our neighbor looks like. The Samaritan didn&#39;t know the injured man in the parable, yet he gives the man whatever he needs to care for his needs.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is an example of loving our neighbor as we love ourselves, for surely we would want someone to help us in the same way if we were the injured man in the parable. Likewise, if we have the opportunity to lend money to someone who may have fallen on hard times, we should seek to do for them what we would like to have been done for us in the same situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we would want if we the one in need? By choosing to serve the needs of others above ourselves, we can demonstrate the love of Christ exemplified by the parable of the Good Samaritan. Selflessness gives glory to God and may even become an opportunity for God to bring someone into His kingdom through a demonstration of Christ&#39;s love.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. I have listened to the whole book of Romans but this verse below [James 2:24] seems to indicate that works are necessary for justification and not faith alone.</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. This is the question at the heart of the Reformation. It has been said that the Reformation hinged on one word: alone. What was at stake was the gospel itself. Is one saved by faith alone in Christ alone, or are works also necessary to be saved? Arguably, this is one of the most important questions a Christian can ask.</p>\n\n<p>Before we get into the answer, it&rsquo;s important to remember that we let Scripture interpret Scripture. Also, we let the explicit interpret the implicit. That is, if we find a verse in Scripture that can be interpreted in more than one way (implicit) but find another verse that can only be interpreted one way (explicit), we use the one that is clear to interpret the one that is less clear. This is because God is not the author of confusion (1 Corinthians 14:33).</p>\n\n<p>The short answer to the question is that a person is saved by faith alone in Christ alone, and not by works. We see this in Scripture in two ways.</p>\n\n<p>First, as we learned in Romans, God is the one who decides who is saved. Romans 9:15-16 in particular showed that our salvation is not based what we do, but on what God does:</p>\n\n<h5>For He says to Moses, \"I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.\" So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.</h5>\n\n<p>If God is the one who chooses on whom it is He will have mercy, then it is not logically possible that our works can play any part in our salvation (&ldquo;it is not of him who wills or runs&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p>Some people, however, do not believe in the doctrine of election (even though it is taught very explicitly in Scripture). So, the second proof in Scripture to which we can point is what Paul says in Romans 4 and 5. Since you just studied Romans, this will be fresh in your mind. Rather than repeat all of the verses to prove that we are saved by faith alone in Christ alone, let&rsquo;s look at a high-level summary of Romans chapters 1-5.</p>\n\n<p>In Romans chapters 1-3, Paul lays out the case that all mankind has sinned against God, they know God exists, but they do not acknowledge Him as God nor do they seek Him. There is none righteous, no not one, not Jew, not Gentile. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Having convicted all humanity of sin, Paul now moves on to how one can be reconciled to God in chapter 4.</p>\n\n<p>Using Abraham (who transcends both Jew and Gentile) as his example, Paul demonstrates that a person is justified (i.e., counted righteous in God&rsquo;s eyes) by faith, not by works. It&rsquo;s important to mention here that Paul is not talking about works of the Law, for Abraham came before the Law; therefore, works refers to any human works. We read in v. 4:3:</p>\n\n<h5>For what does the Scripture say? ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.</h5>\n\n<p>Paul&rsquo;s point is clear: like Abraham, we are saved by faith, and by faith, God credits, imputes, assigns to us His righteousness. More could be said, but the key point is that it is by faith that God credits righteousness to us, not works.</p>\n\n<p>Having made his case that we are justified by faith, Paul begins chapter 5 with this conclusion, &ldquo;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; in verse 5:1 is a logical conclusion to what Paul just said in Romans 4.</p>\n\n<p>To make sure we understand this, Paul makes a comparison of how we became sinners and how we can become righteous. He does this by making a parallel comparison and contrast with Adam and Christ. Before we were born, before we did anything, we are counted sinners because of Adam&rsquo;s transgression (5:12). In other words, sin was imputed, credited to Adam&rsquo;s progeny because of his transgression.</p>\n\n<p>Our works did not make us sinners; rather, we sin because we are sinners. Paul then shows that, similarly, believers are counted righteous by Christ&rsquo;s obedience (as contrasted with Adam&rsquo;s transgression). This point was made in chapter 4, and Paul makes it clear that he means we are counted righteous not by what we do, but solely by Christ&rsquo;s obedience. This is important, because obedience means works.</p>\n\n<p>The whole point of Romans 5 is to emphasize the similarity of Adam and Jesus, with one leading to sin and death, and the other leading to righteousness. Therefore, in context, vs. 5:14-19 clearly teaches that we are made righteous not by our obedience, but by Christ&rsquo;s obedience:</p>\n\n<h5>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many. The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions resulting in justification. For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. For as through the one man&#39;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Verse 14 makes clear that even though we didn&rsquo;t commit the same sin Adam committed in the garden of Eden, we all still died. This means we all sinned in some way, for death came into the world because of sin. This is the, by the way, the chapter in Scripture to which theologians will point when they teach &ldquo;original sin&rdquo;. It means we inherited Adam&rsquo;s sinful nature (see vs.5:12 and 5:19: we were &ldquo;made sinners&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p>This is also why Jesus was born of a virgin by the power of the Holy Spirit. It was necessary that He not have a human father (for sin comes from Adam, the father). With God as His Father, He could be born sinless, even though it was through a human mother.</p>\n\n<p>Romans 5 also ties in with many other Scriptures that speak about the righteousness of God. I think 2 Corinthians 5:21 says it well, &ldquo;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&rdquo; Christ took the penalty for our sin, and gave us His righteousness, which is imputed to us by faith. It is on this basis alone that we are counted righteous, not by any works we do.</p>\n\n<p>As Paul makes clear in Titus 3:4-7:</p>\n\n<h5>But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</h5>\n\n<p>It is also why Jeremiah says we will call Him &ldquo;the LORD our righteousness.&rdquo; (Jeremiah 23:6) If salvation is by works, then, logically, our works would be what makes us righteous. Yet over and over again, Scripture says the Lord is our righteousness. Again, this agrees completely with Romans 5. In a sense, though, works do make us righteous. However, it is not our works, it is Christ&rsquo;s works, His obedience, that makes us righteous.</p>\n\n<p>Now, just to make sure we&#39;re not reading our view into what Paul has said all the way through chapter 5, let&rsquo;s suppose that James 2 teaches that salvation is by works and then apply that viewpoint to where Paul goes next in Romans.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout Romans, Paul likes to ask questions he anticipates his reader will have. If salvation is by grace through faith in Christ, but then depends on us to be obedient (i.e., our works), and is conditional on our obeying the commandments, We would expect that Paul would now move into teaching us how to be obedient to ensure that we will be saved.</p>\n\n<p>But instead, chapter six begins with this question, &ldquo;What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that grace may increase?&rdquo; This question fits perfectly with the logical flow of what Paul has just previously taught. If I am not saved by what I do, if I am saved solely by faith, by which Christ&rsquo;s righteousness is imputed to me, then a logical question is hey, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I continue to sin, does it In fact, the more I sin, Paul, the more grace will abound!</p>\n\n<p>Paul goes on to deal with this erroneous thought. Clearly, Paul is not teaching that we are saved by works but only by faith alone in Christ alone. So, we see that Scripture explicitly teaches that we are saved not by works, but by faith alone in Christ alone (remember what we said about explicit and implicit teaching in Scripture).</p>\n\n<p>Knowing this, let&rsquo;s next look at what James says. As we do this, keep this thought in mind. When James says, &ldquo;You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone&rdquo;, it appears he is saying that we are saved by works.</p>\n\n<p>However, another way to interpret this verse is that James is saying that a man manifests (makes known) his justification (his salvation) by what he does, not just by saying he has faith. This is clearly implied when this verse is interpreted properly in its context. If we take what Paul says as explicit, and what James says as explicit, then we have a contradiction. Since God is the author of all Scripture (2 Timothy 3:16), and since God is perfect, then there cannot be a contradiction in Scripture. Either we have misinterpreted what Paul says in Romans, or we have misinterpreted what James says.</p>\n\n<p>We maintain that James is not teaching that we are saved by faith and works, but that he is teaching that we make known our salvation to the world by our works. The world cannot look on our heart and know we have faith, as God can; they can only see it by what we do.</p>\n\n<p>With that as a background, let&rsquo;s look at what James teaches in chapters 1 and 2 that lead up to his statement in v. 2:24. First, we see that James is writing to Christians, those who are already saved. He is writing about how they are to live as Christians. He speaks about persecutions, about our need to trust in God&rsquo;s provisions. Some key verses in James 1:18-25 are these:</p>\n\n<h5>In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures. This you know, my beloved brethren But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger; for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God. Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save your souls. But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; for once he has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was. But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.</h5>\n\n<p>Note that in v.18, James says that God brought us forth by the &ldquo;exercise of His will.&rdquo; In v.21 he says the word &ldquo;implanted&rdquo; will save your soul. The Greek word for implanted is <em>emphutos</em>, which means &ldquo;inborn, implanted by nature, implanted by others instruction.\" It refers to something planted in us.</p>\n\n<p>Both of these verses tie in perfectly with Paul&rsquo;s teaching on election. This is something God performed, not something we did. Furthermore, the word from which <em>emphutos</em> is derived is <em>phuo</em>, which means &ldquo;to produce, to become, to grow.&rdquo; This suggests, then, that the word that saves us will also grow in us and produce something in us, namely, good works.</p>\n\n<p>This is exactly where James goes next, talking about being doers of the word. If you hear the word (that is, the gospel), but are not a doer, you have deceived yourself into thinking that you are indeed saved. Importantly, James says &ldquo;prove&rdquo; yourself as a doer of the word by being someone who &ldquo;abides by it&rdquo; (v.25).</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, James here is not saying we are saved by works. On the contrary, he just stated that the word was &ldquo;implanted&rdquo; in us by the exercise of God&rsquo;s will, which is something we are not even able to accomplish. It&rsquo;s obvious that he is commanding believers to show that they have this implanted word by being a doer. This is how the word grows in us and produces (<em>phuo</em>) good works. He also does not say we will be saved by being a doer; rather, we will be blessed.</p>\n\n<p>James then continues by stating how we prove ourselves doers of the word. A true believer (one who has had faith implanted in his soul by the exercise of God&rsquo;s will) will bridle his tongue, visit orphans and widows, keep himself unstained from the world, and not show favoritism. He tells us to show mercy, just as we have been shown mercy in Christ.</p>\n\n<p>So, the context of James&rsquo; letter to believers is that we are to demonstrate our faith by what we do (prove ourselves to be doers of the word). He gives specific examples of how we can do this. Then, beginning in 2:14, he says:</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him?&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>This is an important verse for understanding v2:24. Note that James is focused on a particular kind of faith. If a person has a faith that produces no works, he has deceived himself because that faith is no faith, and thus, cannot save anyone. Indeed, it is a &ldquo;dead&rdquo; faith (v. 17). James then continues in 2:18-26:</p>\n\n<h5>But someone may well say, \"You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.\" You believe that God is one You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder. But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, \"AND ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,\" and he was called the friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>James continues to emphasize that works prove a person&rsquo;s faith. He says we show we have faith by our works. Just saying we believe is not enough, for even the demons do this, yet they hate God and will ultimately be destroyed. Anyone can say they have faith, but true faith is a faith that results in works. This is in complete agreement with Ephesians 2:8-10</p>\n\n<h5>For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice that we are not saved by works but are created for good works. This is what James is also saying, for if we have been saved, and if God saved us for good works, then a person with true faith will show his faith by his good works.</p>\n\n<p>Verses 20-26 are very important verses. Note that James focuses on how we know someone has faith. In v.22, he says &ldquo;you see.\" He says it again in vs.24 and implies it in v.25. So, the focus is on demonstrating that a person has faith, not that works saves a person. Importantly, James discusses Abraham&rsquo;s offering of Isaac in Genesis 22.</p>\n\n<p>This is important, because in Romans 4, Paul discusses Abraham being saved by faith and not by works, referring to Genesis 15. It would be helpful to go back and read both Genesis 15 and 22, but suffice it to say here that God gave the Abrahamic covenant in Genesis 15, and it was an unconditional covenant. This means that God promised to save Abraham and his seed, without any condition on Abraham&rsquo;s part. This is contrasted with the Mosaic covenant, which said Israel would be saved only if they perfectly obeyed the Law.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if God unconditionally promised to save Abraham and his seed in Genesis 15, then why did He ask Abraham to sacrifice Isaac in Genesis 22? The text even says, after Abraham was going to sacrifice Isaac, that God now knows that Abraham feared God. He goes on to say in Genesis 22:16-18:</p>\n\n<h5>By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son, indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies. In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.</h5>\n\n<p>This text makes it appear that God really didn&rsquo;t know that Abraham had faith until He tested him (v. 16, &ldquo;because you have done this thing&rdquo;). Yet, we read the following back in Genesis 15:5-6:</p>\n\n<h5>And He took him outside and said, \"Now look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count them \" And He said to him, \"So shall your descendants be.\" Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as righteousness.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>The point here is that Abraham was already counted righteous in Genesis 15 because he believed God&rsquo;s promise. Paul refers to this text in Romans 4 to emphasize that Abraham was saved solely by faith. Obviously, since God gave Abraham that faith (Ephesians 2:8 says faith is a gift from God), God knew what Abraham would do with respect to Isaac.</p>\n\n<p>This begs the question, why did God ask Abraham to sacrifice Isaac? It is because this act showed men that Abraham had faith. Looking at Abraham&rsquo;s life leading up to Genesis 22, one would not necessarily conclude that Abraham had faith in God. For example, in Genesis 20, Abraham tells Abimelech that Sarah is his sister. He does this so Abimelech will not kill him and take Sarah. Is this the picture of a person who has faith in God? So, God asks Abraham to make the ultimate sacrifice: kill your son, your only son, whom you love.</p>\n\n<p>By obeying God, we &ldquo;see&rdquo; that Abraham had faith, as James points out. Likewise, how could Rahab, a prostitute, be saved? She, too, had faith and it was manifested when she helped Israel&rsquo;s spies. Without this righteous act, it would appear that God saved a wicked prostitute who only disobeyed God.</p>\n\n<p>Hebrews 11 makes the same point, first stating that men gained approval by faith, and then listing several examples of works that were done by faith. Indeed, the author of Hebrews 11:17-19 says of Abraham:}</p>\n\n<h5>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son; it was he to whom it was said, \"IN ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS SHALL BE CALLED.\" He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Note that Abraham was &ldquo;tested&rdquo; to prove his faith. In this sense, the Scripture was fulfilled (James 2:23). God had already made Abraham righteous by giving him faith to believe God&rsquo;s promise. This was fulfilled in men&rsquo;s eyes by Abraham showing his willingness to offer up his son.</p>\n\n<p>While this should be enough to demonstrate that our works do not save us, some will say (and have said) that James 2:24 uses the same word for justification that Paul uses, so it must mean that works are necessary for salvation. If that is true, then, using this exact same logic, wisdom must also be saved.</p>\n\n<p>In Matthew 11:19, Jesus says:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>&ldquo;The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, &#39;Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!&#39; Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>The word &ldquo;vindicated&rdquo; is the same Greek word for justification. In fact, some English translations use the word justification.</p>\n\n<p>The NASB used vindicated, because it makes no sense to say that wisdom is justified; that is, wisdom cannot be &ldquo;saved.\" Therefore, we have a clear and explicit example in Scripture where the word justified can also mean vindicated, or proven. Thus, James is not saying a person is saved by works, but that a person proves he has faith (vindicates his faith) by his works.</p>\n\n<p>Given all of the above, we conclude that a person is saved by faith alone in Christ alone, and not by works. Let us give thanks to God for this, because if we were saved by our works, we would never become righteous. If we were saved by works, we would not have the peace that passes understanding. Yet the Lord has explained His word so that we may have the assurance of our salvation, knowing that it is based on what Christ has done, not on what we do, &ldquo;for God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 14:33)</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Are the Apostles&#39; supernatural powers available for Christians today? How do you decide when to interpret Jesus&#39; words as universal to all believers or limited to His immediate audience (i.e., the Apostles)?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Regarding the first question, we believe both Scripture and the collective experience of millions of Christians make clear the Apostles were granted unique supernatural abilities not shared by other believers. The office of Apostle was a unique office granted to a limited number of Jewish men, which included unique privileges and powers necessary for their calling. The office was granted solely by the Lord through a personal appearing, including to the Apostle Paul in his experience on the road to Damascus.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe office of Apostle was established for the purpose of founding the church, and it resulted in special powers and authority and privileges. For example, in Matt 19:27-28 Jesus promises the Apostles they will rule over the twelve tribes of Israel. This is a privilege unique to these men.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, in the book of Acts we see numerous examples of the Apostles performing miracles not generally available to other believers. These special powers were used by the Spirit to establish a beach head of faith in the city of Jerusalem and beyond.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Acts 3:1-7, we see a clear example of how the Apostles&#39; supernatural powers worked to promote the growth of the early church.</p>\n<h5>\n\tActs 3:1 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the ninth hour, the hour of prayer.<br />\n\tActs 3:2 And a man who had been lame from his mother&rsquo;s womb was being carried along, whom they used to set down every day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, in order to beg alms of those who were entering the temple.<br />\n\tActs 3:3 When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he began asking to receive alms.<br />\n\tActs 3:4 But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, &ldquo;Look at us!&rdquo;<br />\n\tActs 3:5 And he began to give them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.<br />\n\tActs 3:6 But Peter said, &ldquo;I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene &mdash; walk!&rdquo;<br />\n\tActs 3:7 And seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up; and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tIn that passage, Peter heals a paralytic man through a presentation of the Gospel followed immediately by a command to rise and walk. It&#39;s clear from the text that Paul determined to work through this man&#39;s circumstances to establish the Gospel. After Peter heals him, Acts 3:11-4:4 records the effect of this miracle. Through this miracle, Peter obtains an audience of Jews for a wider presentation of the Gospel, and it results in 5,000 new believers coming to faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can find many more examples like this one in the book of Acts, in keeping with Jesus&#39; words to these men. As another example, you may remember the words Jesus spoke to the Apostles:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMatt. 16:19 &ldquo;I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.&rdquo;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tJesus&#39; statement has often confused Bible students, who wonder what it means that a believer could \"bind\" or \"loose\" things both in heaven and earth. We must remember Jesus spoke these words to the Apostles, and we can see it&#39;s unique purpose in their ministry demonstrated in places like Acts 5, when Peter confronts a deceptive believer. In Acts 5:1-5 Peter \"binds\" a believer to a judgment of physical death for his deceptive practices in the church.</p>\n<h5>\n\tActs 5:1 But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,<br />\n\tActs 5:2 and kept back some of the price for himself, with his wife&rsquo;s full knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, h laid it at the apostles&rsquo; feet.<br />\n\tActs 5:3 But Peter said, &ldquo;Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?<br />\n\tActs 5:4 &ldquo;While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.&rdquo;<br />\n\tActs 5:5 And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came over all who heard of it.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe effect (and therefore, the purpose) of this power is shown a few verses later:</p>\n<h5>\n\tActs 5:11 And great fear came over the whole church, and over all who heard of these things.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tThe church becomes fearfully reverent of Christ&#39;s power over His Church as exercised through the office of the Apostles. Later, Paul leverages this same respect for a similar good purpose in rebuking the Corinthian church in 1Cor:</p>\n<h5>\n\t1Cor. 4:18 Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.<br />\n\t1Cor. 4:19 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I shall find out, not the words of those who are arrogant but their power.<br />\n\t1Cor. 4:20 For the kingdom of God does not consist in words but in power.<br />\n\t1Cor. 4:21 What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?<br />\n\t1Cor. 5:1 It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, that someone has his father&rsquo;s wife.<br />\n\t1Cor. 5:2 You have become arrogant and have not mourned instead, so that the one who had done this deed would be removed from your midst.<br />\n\t1Cor. 5:3 For I, on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this, as though I were present.<br />\n\t1Cor. 5:4 In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,<br />\n\t1Cor. 5:5 I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\tPaul challenged false teachers in that church by reminding them that the authority of his teaching was backed up by supernatural power (v.20). If these false teachers were going to contradict his teaching, they had better be prepared to demonstrate similar supernatural power to validate their authority (which they couldn&#39;t do, of course). Paul then goes on to give a demonstration of his Apostolic power to \"bind\" on earth and in heaven by judging the behavior of a sinful member of the church and condemning him to physical death at the hands of the Enemy. Paul accomplished this judgment while still living hundreds of miles away!</p>\n<p>\n\tMoving from Scripture to our personal experience today, we recognize that Christians today simply do not have such powers. Try as we might, we cannot repeat the \"binding\" and \"loosing\" that the Apostles exercised. Likewise, Christians today do not routinely raise men from the dead, cause paralytics to walk, cast out demons, etc. Our collective experience confirms Scripture&#39;s teaching that Jesus awarded unique powers to the Apostles for specific purposes in founding the early church.</p>\n<p>\n\tPlease note we are not suggesting that such miracles are impossible today; rather, we are saying they are no longer common experiences for the Church, nor can they be summoned at will by believers as the Apostles once did. In keeping with their office and mission to establish the early church, the Apostles demonstrated these powers (including those mentioned in Mark 16:15-18) during their lives, but the powers have clearly faded from the common experience. Therefore, we should not expect nor desire them today. Instead, the Church is called to witness to the world through God&#39;s word and through a life lived to God (Rom 12:1-2).</p>\n<p>\n\tTo your second question regarding when to interpret Jesus&#39; words broadly for all believers, our response should be a familiar one: context. We must rely on the context of Scripture to guide our interpretation, and by context we mean the entire Bible, particularly the New Testament. Here are some general guidelines we follow when relying on Biblical context to understanding how to interpret and apply Jesus&#39; teaching:</p>\n<p>\n\t1. Who did Jesus address with His comments? Did He repeat his comments to multiple audiences?<br />\n\t2. What application did Jesus make, if any?<br />\n\t3. How did Jesus&#39; audience respond to the comments?<br />\n\t4. Do the New Testament authors repeat and extend Jesus&#39; comments to a larger audience?<br />\n\t5. Do we see evidence of Jesus&#39; comments at work in the Church today?</p>\n<p>\n\tAs an example, let&#39;s examine the passage from Mark 16 using these questions:</p>\n<h5>\n\tMark 16:15 And He said to them, &ldquo;Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.<br />\n\tMark 16:16 &ldquo;He who has believed and has been baptized shall be saved; but he who has disbelieved shall be condemned.<br />\n\tMark 16:17 &ldquo;These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name they will cast out demons, they will speak with new tongues;<br />\n\tMark 16:18 they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.&rdquo;<br />\n\tMark 16:19 So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</h5>\n<p>\n\t1. Who did Jesus address with His comments? Did He repeat his comments to multiple audiences?</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus was speaking to the eleven immediately before His ascension. These were His last words to the Apostles. Therefore, He never spoke these words to other believers apart from these eleven men.</p>\n<p>\n\t2. What application did Jesus make, if any?</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus says that these men should go into the world and preach the Gospel, and the signs He lists will \"accompany\" those who believe. The Greek word for \"accompany\" is parakoloutheo, which means \"to follow closely to investigate.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus wasn&#39;t saying that the new believers themselves would have such powers, but rather that when new believers are converted to belief, their conversions would be followed closely by miracles in order to satisfy those who might investigate the legitimacy of such conversions. This statement is perfectly consistent with the scene we saw in Acts 3, when Peter&#39;s conversion of the paralyzed man was \"accompanied\" by the man&#39;s supernatural healing.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the application Jesus makes is that the Apostles should expect to see supernatural proof accompany their work as evangelists to validate their ministry among the people.</p>\n<p>\n\t3. How did Jesus&#39; audience respond to the comments?</p>\n<p>\n\tImmediately, the Apostles began to follow Jesus&#39; words of instruction. Peter and John began declaring the Gospel and producing the miracles Jesus described, beginning in Acts 2 and continuing throughout first century. Famously, Paul encounters a deadly snake in Acts 28:3-5, but he is not harmed by the bite. These experiences confirm that Jesus&#39; immediate audience accepted Jesus&#39; words as a literal truth for their lives and lived accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\t4. Do the New Testament authors repeat and extend Jesus&#39; comments to a larger audience?</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a word, no. None of the New Testament authors ever teach Jesus&#39; words as a universal truth for all believers. The letters from the Apostles give no authority to believers in general to speak in tongues, cast out demons, heal the sick or handle deadly animals without harm, etc.. Consequently, we should not assume to receive such gifts or powers without specific evidence that the Holy Spirit has chosen to gift us such powers.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, we do know that men apart from the eleven Apostles in the early church were gifted to heal and cast out demons (i.e., Acts 8), but these men were also operating under the authority of the Apostles and within the time of the early church. Consequently, we should conclude from the context of Scripture that while such powers are possible outside the office of Apostle, they are not commonly available to believers today nor are believers encouraged to seek or expect such powers.</p>\n<p>\n\t5. Do we see evidence of Jesus&#39; comments at work in the Church today?</p>\n<p>\n\tWe rarely see such powers at work in the Body of Christ today, especially as a consequence of conversions. Remember, Jesus promised that these signs would \"accompany\" conversions. Though supernatural healing, demonic exorcism and other miracles do occur in the Church today from time to time, they are not the common experience when people come to faith. In the earliest days of the Church, they were commonly associated with conversions, but today they are not.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince we know that such power must come from the Spirit, we can conclude that the Spirit has not purposed to make them as prevalently today as He once did in the early Church, which is in keeping with their intended purpose to validate the conversion within the early Church.&nbsp;</p>"

                "url": "https://www.versebyverseministry.org/bible-answers/can_a_woman_teach_men_in_the_church",
                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Is it ever proper for a woman to teach to men in the church? Some churches allow it while others do not.</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The Bible teaches that women are to be under the headship and authority of male leadership in the church, and in one passage in particular (1Tim 2:12), the Bible forbids women to teach. Another comparable passage is found in 1Cor 14:34, where Paul requires women to remain silent in the churches.</p>\n\n<p>The question, of course, is under what circumstances did Paul mean that a woman should refrain from teaching or speaking? For example, can a woman teach her own children or can a woman teach other women in the church? The answer to these questions is yes. Paul himself says elsewhere that an older woman should teach younger women (Titus 2:3), and the Proverbs speak frequently about mothers raising children to respect their instruction. So how are we to interpret Paul&#39;s statements that woman cannot teach or should remain silent in church?</p>\n\n<p>These retraints are not universal prohibitions but rather specific limits intended to ensure the proper exercise of order and authority in the church. Paul taught that the Lord appointed man as the head of the woman in marriage and as leaders&nbsp;of His church. Paul describes the Biblical principle of male headship within the church in 1Cor 11, explaining that spiritual authority flows from Christ to the man and then to the woman according to God&#39;s design.</p>\n\n<p>The principle of male headship within the church must be respected in any situation where authority is exhibited before the congregation. Teaching God&#39;s word is inherently an expression of authority within the church, so anytime&nbsp;a woman exercises her teaching gift, she is&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;assuming an authority position in the church. Therefore when a woman teaches men in the church, she implies she has authority over these men&#39;s spiritual lives, which is in violation of the Biblical principle of headship. Her teaching role leaves the impression (if not the reality) that she is operating outside the cover of male leadership in the church.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, before a woman is permitted to teach in a church, we must ask whether the woman&#39;s exercise of authority by her teaching will conflict with male headship in the church. Generally speaking, a woman may teach male and female children without jeopardizing male headship, since children do not hold authority in the church, and a women may teach other women without limitation. On the other hand, a woman should not provide Biblical instruction to men (or mixed groups of men and women) except under very limited circumstances where&nbsp;precautions are taken to ensure male headship remains intact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Though the specific procedures may vary, the effect must always be to project male leadership over the woman teacher and her teaching. While we generally recommend against women&nbsp;teaching to&nbsp;mixed classes of men and women, when it is necessary we recommend the following procedures to ensure male headship is always in place and made evident to our students.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Specifically, a male ministry leader should introduce the teacher, explaining she is under his authority, while remaining present in the room during the study. This leader must have authority to correct the woman&#39;s teaching, on the spot if necessary, or even assume control of the class and deliver the instruction himself if required. Additionally, the male leader should field&nbsp;any questions from&nbsp;students in the class.&nbsp;</span>By following these procedures, male headship is maintained during the teaching event.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In a congregation setting (i.e., during a Sunday morning worship service), we offer a similar recommendation. First,&nbsp;churches should not allow a woman teacher in the pulpit, but at the very least they should adopt a similar set of procedures to guide the involvement of women teachers in the service. Specifically, a woman should not teach to the general assembly of the church (i.e., one that includes men) unless there is&nbsp;compelling reason to do so, and then the church must take&nbsp;precautions to ensure male headship is evident. A&nbsp;male teacher should be present and actively participating in the meeting, including introducing the woman teacher and reassuring the congregation that she operates under headship of the male teacher.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the male leader should offer to answer questions from the men in the audience, and he should end the event with a recap or review of the woman&#39;s teaching to make clear that it agrees with the leadership&#39;s views on the topic or passage of Scripture. These procedures communicate clearly that male headship is present and that the woman is operating under proper cover.</p>\n\n<p>Though these procedures may help ensure male headship is maintained in the church, nevertheless we advise against a woman teaching to a mixed group to avoid violating the principle of scripture established in Paul&#39;s teaching. Whenever possible, the church should substitute a male instructor to teach men.</p>\n\n<p>(You may also be interested in a related <a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/can_a_woman_ever_teach_a_man/\"><strong>article</strong></a> on our website.)</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I heard that wealthy people won&#39;t make it to heaven because their wealth is their god. Is this true? Do wealthy people have a chance for salvation?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. The answer is yes, it is possible for a rich man to be saved by grace, just as all men may be saved. The Scripture includes numerous accounts of men who were wealthy and yet who also followed the Lord faithfully.</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps the best example of a believer who was wealthy is Abraham (e.g., Genesis 12). The Bible testifies he had many sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels, and servants, and yet he was called the father of faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tWealth in and of itself is not evil. The Bible says the love of money is the problem. In 1 Timothy 6:10, Paul says this:</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you say, for some wealthy people, their wealth is their god. Jesus tells us in Matthew 6:24:</p>\n<p>\n\tNo one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.</p>\n<p>\n\tA person who makes wealth his god clearly is not devoted to the true God. Probably the best example of this is when Jesus gives the gospel to the rich young ruler in Matthew 19:16-26:</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd someone came to Him and said, \"Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?\" And He said to him, \"Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.\" Then he said to Him, \"Which ones?\" And Jesus said, \"YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT MURDER; YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY; YOU SHALL NOT STEAL; YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS; HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER; and YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.\" The young man said to Him, \"All these things I have kept; what am I still lacking?\"</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus said to him, \"If you wish to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.\" But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieving; for he was one who owned much property. And Jesus said to His disciples, \"Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. \"Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" When the disciples heard this, they were very astonished and said, \"Then who can be saved?\" And looking at them Jesus said to them, \"With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile it may be difficult for one who is devoted to their wealth to set it aside, if necessary, and come to faith in Jesus Christ, the same barrier exists for all men in one way or another. This is why the Apostles asked the question above and why Jesus responded by saying that the impossible is possible for God. The truth is no one can be saved in his own power to live righteously and choose God over our earthly desires. Salvation comes by faith alone, and faith is the free gift of God (Ephesians 2:8). That is why Jesus says it is impossible for men, and possible only with God.</p>\n<p>\n\tNote that the reverse of Matthew 6:24 is also true. If a person loves and is devoted to God, he will despise wealth. That is to say, he will not put his confidence in his wealth or rest in it. We see this with Abraham as well, as Scripture tells us he never saw this earth as his home. Hebrews 11:9-10 puts it this way:</p>\n<p>\n\tBy faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</p>\n<p>\n\tAbraham was never devoted to his wealth. He always looked forward to heaven, where his true home was.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, in summary, Scripture does not tell us that a wealthy person cannot go to heaven. Rather, God says that a person who devotes himself to wealth and to gaining more of it cannot be a servant of God, because such a person is giving evidence that mooney is their master, and he cannot serve two masters. People who serve wealth (or make it their god) clearly do not seek to serve God because they do they know Him truly. In all likelihood, these people will not go to heaven, unless and until they come to know the one true God in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Can you explain what the \"Kingdom of God\" is in the Bible?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The term \"Kingdom of God\" has been interpreted to mean many things. Typically, Bible students either believe the Kingdom is a literally, physical time and place or is merely a metaphor for something else. Within these two broad categories, there are multiple variants of belief. For example, some who take a literal view of the Kingdom believe it is present on earth today, while others view it to be a future time and place on the earth, while still others view it to be a combination of both a present Kingdom and a future Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>VBVM to a literal view of Scripture wherever possible, including in this case. Specifically, we understand Jesus to teach about His Kingdom in the four ways, including a literal sense of a future time and place and people. The fulfillment of the Kingdom will occur in the 1,000-year reign of Christ on Earth following His return to Earth at the end of the Tribulation (Rev 19 &amp; 20).</p>\n\n<p>For a complete explanation of the four ways the Bible uses the term kingdom, please read our article <strong><a href=\"/devotionals/kingdom-come\">Kingdom Come</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In its most literal sense, the Kingdom is a place Christ will occupy the throne of David and rule over Jerusalem, the Jewish nation and over all nations of the Earth. He rules until all things have been placed under subjection to Himself at the end of the 1,000 years (1Cor 15:28). We believe the Bible precludes any other interpretation or understanding of God&#39;s Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s important to remember that Jesus spoke of a literal Kingdom. For example, in Luke 22:18, Jesus says:</p>\n\n<p>\"For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.\"</p>\n\n<p>This statement only makes sense when interpreted in light of a literal, physical Kingdom to come. If His kingdom is a literal reign, then like any kingdom it must consist of three things: a king, a land with specific borders, and a people to rule over. The Bible gives us all three elements when it describes Christ&#39;s Kingdom. First, many, many places in Scripture testify to the plain fact that Jesus is the King of God&#39;s Kingdom, including His own words in Matt 27:11:</p>\n\n<p>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, &ldquo;Are You the King of the Jews?&rdquo; And Jesus said to him, &ldquo; It is as you say.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Scripture makes clear that the people of the King are the Jewish nation. Isaiah 11 and Deuteronomy 30 (among many other places in Scripture) make clear that the Christ is the King promised to rule over Israel. Because of Israel&#39;s disobedience, however, the Gentile nations are being grafted into these promises to share in the kingdom of Israel and the opportunity to know their King. Nevertheless, the Gentiles will never replace or substitute for the Jewish subjects of Christ&#39;s rule, who have been promised to live in the Kingdom. We are always to be \"a strange people\" who have been invited to join the kingdom as Christ&#39;s Bride (Rom 11:11-36).</p>\n\n<p>Third, the land Christ will rule over includes the entire world, but He rules from Zion, and Jerusalem Scripture says. The land of Christ&#39;s Kingdom includes the whole world, but it is specifically headquartered in Jerusalem, and since this has not happened as yet, we know the Kingdom is a future event to today.</p>\n\n<p>Christ our King didn&#39;t set up His literal kingdom on Earth and rule over the Jewish nation at His first coming, because though Jesus declared many times in the Gospels that HIs kingdom was \"at hand,\" His people rejected Him. So Jesus departed for a time while He waits for the Jewish people to reverse that decision. We see Him make this declaration in Luke 13:34-35:</p>\n\n<p>\"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not have it! Behold, your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say, &lsquo; BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Because the King was rejected by His people, He declined to reign at this first opportunity. Instead, He went to the cross and then entrusted the message of the coming kingdom (i.e., the Gospel) with His Church so we might carry it forward until His return. So, today the kingdom is still \"at hand,\" just as it was when Jesus came Himself. It will remain \"at hand\" until the King returns to establish the Kingdom in fact (Heb 3:7-13).</p>\n\n<p>Jesus describes this situation of a delayed kingdom in the parable of the minas:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5>Luke 19:11 While they were listening to these things, Jesus went on to tell a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.<br />\nLuke 19:12 So He said, &ldquo; A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return.<br />\nLuke 19:13 &ldquo;And he called ten of his slaves, and gave them ten minas and said to them, &lsquo;Do business with this until I come back.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 19:14 &ldquo;But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, &lsquo;We do not want this man to reign over us.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 19:15 &ldquo;When he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him so that he might know what business they had done.<br />\nLuke 19:16 &ldquo;The first appeared, saying, &lsquo; Master, your mina has made ten minas more.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 19:17 &ldquo;And he said to him, &lsquo;Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to be in authority over ten cities.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 19:18 &ldquo;The second came, saying, &lsquo;Your mina, master, has made five minas.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 19:19 &ldquo;And he said to him also, &lsquo;And you are to be over five cities.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 19:20 &ldquo;Another came, saying, &lsquo;Master, here is your mina, which I kept put away in a handkerchief;<br />\nLuke 19:21 for I was afraid of you, because you are an exacting man; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 19:22 &ldquo;He said to him, &lsquo; By your own words I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am an exacting man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?<br />\nLuke 19:23 &lsquo;Then why did you not put my money in the bank, and having come, I would have collected it with interest?&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 19:24 &ldquo;Then he said to the bystanders, &lsquo;Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 19:25 &ldquo;And they said to him, &lsquo;Master, he has ten minas already.&rsquo;<br />\nLuke 19:26 &ldquo; I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.<br />\nLuke 19:27 &ldquo;But these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We see clearly from this parable that the kingdom was not intended to appear at Jesus&#39; first coming (see Luke 19:11). Rather, the arrival of the kingdom was delayed until Jesus&#39; return, pictured by the Master&#39;s return in Luke 19:15. Likewise, we today await the King&#39;s return so He may rule over His physical kingdom and subjects in a future day.</p>\n\n<p>We have many in-depth teachings available online that address this topic. In particular, our teaching through the Gospel of Luke examines&nbsp;Jesus&#39; own statements concerning the Kingdom at many points, as does our teaching through Revelation and our on-going study through Isaiah.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. I have heard your \"Evolution vs. Creation\" presentation, but I can&#39;t remember the reasons you said Evolution contradicted Scripture. Can you summarive the points again?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Our Evolution vs. Creation seminar, <em>The Rocks Cry Out</em>, is a 5-hour presentation on the flaws in the science of Evolution and the ways in which it opposes and contradicts the Bible. The course offers many proofs and includes many details we can&#39;t provide here in this short answer. Simply put, Evolution theory conflicts with Scripture in many fundamental ways. Meanwhile, here are some key points from the presentation:</p>\n<p>\n\t- The entire account of Creation in Genesis 1-2 stands opposed to Evolution. God created everything as it is, out of nothing, and did so in six literal days.</p>\n<p>\n\t- Death was not a part of God&#39;s creation. Death is the result of God&#39;s curse on the Earth as a result of man&#39;s sin. God&#39;s future plan for the Earth removes this curse and eliminates death altogether. Evolution declares the opposite, that death is normal, natural and essential to advancing species. According to Evolution theory, death will always exist.</p>\n<p>\n\t- God&#39;s word declares that the world is withering away, decaying and groaning under the weight of sin. Lives are growing shorter, disease will increase, resources will diminish. Therefore, Creation longs for a day when it will be replaced. Evolution declares the opposite, that the normal course of life and death results in an improvement of each new generation over the previous generation. Evolution states that lives are lengthening, health is improving through survival of the fittest.</p>\n<p>\n\t- Paul declares in Romans that because through one man (Adam) sin entered the world, and by that sin death spread to all men, therefore through one man (Christ) eternal life is made available. This New Testament theology declares that Jesus came the New Adam and lived a sinless life so that His death on the cross could pay the penalty for our sin and put an end to death. His sacrifice, therefore, was necessary to reverse the course of death for those who trust in Him. Our salvation rests on this cornerstone theology, and it depends on a literal Adam because it attributes all death to his act of sin.</p>\n<p>\n\tEvolution completely reverses this thinking and completely negates the need for Christ. If death is natural and came before men and their sin, then the theology of the New Testament is bankrupt. There would be no need for a \"new Adam\" if there was no original Adam, and if death came before sin, then there is no value found in Christ&#39;s death for our sin. How does God dying in our place put an end to death if death is natural and not the result of disobedience?</p>\n<p>\n\tOur Evolution vs. Creation class explains and more in greater detail, but these points are the main highlights.</p>"

I see many Scriptures that talk about this \"age\" and the \"age to come.\" What are ages and how many are there?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Regarding the ages mentioned in Scripture, there are at least three and possibly four ages referenced in Scripture.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, there is the age prior to Christ&#39;s appearing. Peter describes this age of waiting for Christ in the introduction to his first letter (1Peter 3-12):</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t<em style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy&nbsp; has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are&nbsp; protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various&nbsp; trials, so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls. As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries, seeking to know what person or time&nbsp; the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories&nbsp; to follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven &mdash; things into which angels long to&nbsp; look.</em></h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn verse 5, Peter refers to our salvation in Christ has been revealed in the \"last time.\" In the Greek, the words are \"eschatos kairos,\" which translated literally means \"the end of the age.\" The salvation we have now in Christ revealed is a salvation revealed in the last age. So, ages are measured, according to Scripture, with respect to God&#39;s plan of redemption.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe age before Christ&#39;s revealing is the first age, which then gave way to our current age called \"the last times\" or the Church age. Notice that Peter says in verses 10-12 that the prophets were serving us in that earlier age by revealing the truth concerning Christ and the age to come, things that angels long to look upon. Paul echoes this in his letter to the Colossians (Col 1:25-27):</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t<em style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">Of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His&nbsp; saints, to whom&nbsp; God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</em></h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tOther verses in the New Testament (including the ones you quoted) speak of yet another age to follow this one. Again, ages are defined according to events in God&#39;s plan of redemption, so this future age will complete God&#39;s plan of redemption.&nbsp; According to Scripture, we know this future age is the age of Christ&#39;s kingdom on Earth, the Millennial reign of Christ described in Revelation 20. This age will, in turn, give way to a fourth age called the Eternal order.&nbsp; Paul describes this age in 1Corinthians 15:25-28:</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\t<em style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \">For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The last enemy that will be&nbsp; abolished is death. For HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET. But when He says, &ldquo;All things are put in subjection,&rdquo; it is evident that He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him. When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.</em></h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul gives us glimpse of what follows the 1,000-year reign of Christ, when he describes the age to follow as a time when God becomes \"all in all.\" John also gives a tantilizing description of this future age in Revelation 21 and 22.</p>"

Some scholars have argued that Deuteronomy 30:1-9 contains a new and separate covenant from the one offered through Moses, a covenant commonly called the Palestinial Covenant.

These reminders were intended to teach Israel that righteousness and the opportunity to live eternally with God in His kingdom did not rest on their performance of the Law but on their faith and trust in the One who could perform the Law on their behalf (i.e., by grace).<br style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \" />\n\t<br style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; \" />\n\tPaul makes the same point in Romans 10:5-10, when he teaches that Moses&#39; words in Deuteronomy 30 were a call to salvation through a confession of faith, not to a life of righteousness by performing the works of the Law. Therefore, we understand that Deuteronomy 30 was not a new promise or covenant but a reaffirmation of God&#39;s early promise to Abraham that he would become a father to all who believe (Rom 4:13) and would dwell forever in the land God gave Him.</p>"

From the account of the Flood in Genesis, we can make some assumptions as to how different peoples were dispersed around the world after the Flood.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s pretty clear from looking at a world map that the major continents fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Most geologists believe that all of the land masses were together as a single piece of land. This &ldquo;supercontinent&rdquo; has been called &ldquo;Pangea&rdquo; (from the Greek &ldquo;pan&rdquo;, meaning entire, and &ldquo;gaia&rdquo; for earth), pictured here in this graphic.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/world.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 434px; height: 488px; \" /></div>\n<p>\n\tScientists debate how quickly Pangea broke apart. Those believing in evolution tend to view this as occurring over millions or even billions of years. Since evolution is inconsistent with Scripture, we knoiw this must have occured over a much shorter period of time, most likely as a result of the Flood. Let&rsquo;s see how Scripture describes this event.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Genesis 7:11, we read:</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tIn the six hundredth year of Noah&#39;s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the floodgates of the sky were opened.</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was the first rain that ever fell upon the earth, as we read elsewhere in Genesis that God previously sent up a mist that watered the earth. There was probably adequate water in the atmosphere and from fountains below the earth to cover the world in water.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegardless, it&rsquo;s important to note in the text &ldquo;all the fountains of the great deep burst open.\" Clearly, there were large amounts of water under the earth that burst open when God sent the Flood. This is likely what led to Pangea breaking apart.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow quickly this happened Scripture does not tell us. However, we do know from Genesis 7:21-23 that:</p>\n<p>\n\tAll flesh that moved on the earth perished, birds and cattle and beasts and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth, and all mankind; of all that was on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, died. Thus He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky, and they were blotted out from the earth; and only Noah was left, together with those that were with him in the ark.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, from Scripture and from the world today we can know the following: Noah and his family were the only humans on the face of the earth; it would have taken time for Noah and his family to repopulate the earth; we now find humans on every major continent on the earth (apart from Antarctica); and 4) there is archaeological evidence that peoples have lived on every continent for thousands of years, including some like the Indians of North America and the Aborigines of Australia, who show no history of sea navigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom these facts, we can safely conclude that men walked to North America and Australia rather than traveling by ship. Given this data, we can conclude that there must have been a way for peoples to travel from continent to continent by land. Scripture does not address this potic specifically, so we have to make some assumptions from scientific findings.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome scientists theorize there were &ldquo;land bridges&rdquo; connecting the continents for a time as they moved apart. So, as the Lord broke apart Pangea during the Flood, He did slowly enough to allow time for Noah&#39;s descendents to migrate acorss these bridges. God have mankind this direction originally in Genesis 8:17 saying,</p>\n<p>\n\tBring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you, birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s impossible to say exactly how fast this occurred, but this is a plausible explanation consistent with scripture explaining how peoples were disbursed to the several continents. Over time, these land bridges became submerged in the oceans or broke free from the continents. Even today, the continents (the earth&rsquo;s plates) continue to move, which is why we have earthquakes.</p>\n<p>\n\tScripture also tells us that God purposely scattered the peoples throughout the earth. This occurred at the tower of Babel. In Genesis 10, God tells of the various families of the sons of Noah that repopulated the earth. Genesis 10:25 says,</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo sons were born to Eber; the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother&#39;s name was Joktan.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeleg means &ldquo;division,\" while earth here can mean land or inhabitants. In Genesis 11:4-9, we read that there was only one language in all the earth, and we encounter the story of the tower of Babel. The story is encapsulated in the following verses:</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>\n\tThey said, \"Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth. The LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. The LORD said, \"Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for them. &rdquo;Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another&#39;s speech.&rdquo; So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of the whole earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth.</h5>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tClearly, the Lord did not want the people to stay in one place. Rather, He wanted them to scatter abroad, which God accomplished by creating different languages. It&rsquo;s logical to assume that those who could understand one another stayed together and were traveled together to one part of the earth, and likewise for every distinct language group.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s also possible that Genesis 10:25 refers to both the division of the inhabitants of the earth as well as the division of the continents. However, this is unlikely, because such an event (the continents being divided rather rapidly at the time of the tower of Babel) would probably be recorded in human history. For example, most ancient cultures have an account of the Flood, no doubt handed down from Noah and his sons.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince we have no other recorded event where the continents suddenly and rapidly moved apart, we rest on the explanation that the continents moved during the flood. Similarly, land bridges are likely the best explanation for how the peoples moved from one continent to another.</p>"

Is it dealing with the coming death of Christ</em>?</strong><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Regarding Mark 11, Jesus caused the fig tree to wither so He could use it as an object lesson for the disciples. Fig trees are used throughout scripture as a picture of the nation of Israel, and a withered fig tree is a picture of God extending His judgment against an unfruitful Israel (see Jer 8:5-13).</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Jesus came upon the fig tree, we&#39;re told in Mark that Jesus looked for fruit but only found leaves. Curiously, later in the same verse (v.13) Mark tells the reader that this was not the season for figs. Obviously, Jesus would have known that there would be no figs on the tree out of season, so He \"looked\" for figs merely to make a point. After finding no fruit, Jesus commanded that the tree wither and die.</p>\n<p>\n\tJesus was making a point about the coming judgment against Israel, pictured by a fig tree withering. As a nation, Israel was established by God for the purpose of bearing spiritual fruit, ultimately the fruit of receiving God&#39;s Son. Nevertheless, the nation was only interested in pursuing an outward religious lifestyle (i.e., bearing leaves) without showing a true faith in the Messiah (i.e., bearing spiritual fruit). Therefore, the nation was acting hypocritically in putting forth leaves without ever bearing fruit. As a result, God judged the nation for their unbelief (see Luke 13:43-15)</p>\n<p>\n\tYou can study much more on this important topic by listening to several teachings available online. First, listen to Lessons 13B and 21A (or read the teaching notes) from the Gospel of Luke. These lessons give a deeper explanation of how the fig tree pictures Israel and God&#39;s judgement of the nation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, we strongly recommend you listen to our Ruth series. The book of Ruth is an excellent series for understanding God&#39;s plan for the nation of Israel. The Ruth series is relatively short but it should answer many of your questions on this important topic.&nbsp;</p>"

They seem to know what God expected of them. Why don&#39;t we have any background in Scripture on what happened prior to this occurrence?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. While we don&rsquo;t have a complete picture from Scripture, we do have enough information to help us make some logical assumptions. While Cain and Abel&#39;s offering in Genesis 4 appears with no explicit explanation as to why the offering is being made, we do have other Scriptures to help us understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, we know this wasn&#39;t the first offering recorded in Scripture, The very first offering was made in Genesis 3:21, when God made clothes of animal skin for Adam and Eve to cover their nakedness. Using animal skins means animals were killed, most likely as a sacrifice for the sin in the Garden. This offering also foreshadowed Christ&rsquo;s offering, whose righteousness covers our sin (Romans 4:3-8). In both cases, blood was shed, because the shedding of blood is necessary for the forgiveness of sins (Hebrews 9:22).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact that God made an offering for Adam and Eve&#39;s sin and that Abel and Cain are making offerings that include at least one animal&#39;s death allows us to assume that God had instructed Adam and Eve to make such offerings going forward, and they naturally passed that instruction on to their children.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, it only makes sense to assume God instructed man concerning sacrifices, otherwise how God could be said to be pleased or displeased with Abel and Cain&#39;s offerings? While the heart of the one offering is ultimately most important, we know from later Scripture that the manner of our offerings us also important to God.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, while it&rsquo;s possible (and even likely) that this is not the first human offering made, this was the moment in which God decided to confront Cain&rsquo;s unbelief. In our Genesis teaching, both Abel and Cain offered more than one thing, so God was not displeased with the manner of Cain&#39;s offering but with his heart, that is his lack of faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we read in Hebrews 11:4-6:</p>\n<h5>\n\tBy faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks&hellip;.And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.</h5>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, we thank God for the only offering that truly saves, His Son, Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p>"

Is his resurrection different because he was still subject to death again?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. According to Scripture, Jesus was the first person to be resurrected (1Cor 15:20), and you offered part of the answer in your question for why we cannot consider Lazarus (or any of the other people Jesus raised from the dead) to have preceded Jesus in resurrection. Resurrection as it is described in Scripture requires two elements, neither of which were present for Lazarus nor the other people raised from the dead during Jesus&#39; ministry on Earth.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, as you say each person Jesus raised prior to his own resurrection was subject to death again at some later point. A true resurrection is one that returns a person to a permanent state of new life, one in which the person is never to be subjected to death again (see Heb 9:27; Rom 6:8-9; 1Cor 15:54, etc.). When Lazarus died, he didn&#39;t face the moment of judgment nor did he escape death forever. Once Jesus raised him from the dead, he continued in his Earthly life and eventually faced his true death and judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, resurrection is a transformation into a new body, one that is fundamentally different than the one that preceded it. Paul describes the nature of true resurrection at length in 1Cor 15, where he teaches that the body of a resurrected believer is a new, better form than the previous body. When Lazarus and the others like him were brought back to life, they merely returned to their existing, corrupt body. This is why they had to die again, because the putting away of our present body is a necessary prerequisite to receiving a new body.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we assume that Lazarus was a believer in Jesus Christ (probably a safe assumption), then we can be sure he will one day be resurrected into a new body (together with all believers) and will live eternally with Christ. His earlier \"brush with death\" was not his resurrection moment, but simply an opportunity or God to display His power over death. The account in John 11 makes clear that God intended for Lazarus to die temporarily so that he could be raised again (John 11:4).</p>"

On the issue of women wearing pants in church (as opposed to wearing only dresses), the Bible is silent on this specific point, so our personal liberty in Christ and the commandment to love one another must dictate our choices in this area. We know that the word of God teaches that women (and men) should dress modestly at all times, so we may avoid becoming a cause for others to sin. In some cases, women wearing pants at church might be a poor choice according to these standards, yet in other cases such attire would be harmless and therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe decision for what constitutes proper attire for women (and men, for that matter) in any church ultimately rests on the guidance of the church leadership, and to a lessor degree on the cultural expectations of the congregation. We are called to obey those appointed over us in the church (Heb 13:17), including in matters of personal liberty, so if the elders believe women shouldn&#39;t wear pants in church, then women should obey this restriction.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, if the congregation has certain cultural expectations for dress standards, then anyone called to fellowship in that congregation should be prepared to observe those cultural requirements out of love for the Body and respect for the concerns of others. To do otherwise would be to cause disagreement and disharmony within the Body of Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, anyone who strongly objects to a church&#39;s dress standards is free to seek a different fellowship, where dress standards are more compatible with her views on personal liberty in Christ. Finally, keep in mind that personal dress is not an essential issue of faith, so consider that the Bible consistently calls upon Christians to forgo their own personal liberties for the sale of the unity of the Body and for the higher principle of loving one another (Rom 14).</p>\n<p>\n\tFor more articles on the role of women in the church, please click on the following links:</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/woman_evangelizing_men/\">Women evanglizing men</a></strong><br />\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/must_women_remain_silent_in_church/\">Women remain silent in church?</a></strong><br />\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/can_a_woman_ever_teach_a_man/\">Can a woman teach a man?</a><br />\n\t<a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/can_a_woman_teach_men_in_the_church/\">Can a woman holding teaching authority?</a></strong><br />\n\t<strong><a href=\"http://www.versebyverseministry.org/resource_library/questions_and_answers/my_pastor_allows_women_to_preach_in_the_church/\">Can a woman preach?</a></strong><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

If Moses had to takeoff his shoe was it because Moses had fled Egypt and failed to redeem Israel at the time he fled?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Your observation was excellent, but it leads to a slightly different conclusion than the one you offered. First, we should be clear on the literal meaning of the text in Exodus 3. Moses was instructed to remove his sandals, because he was standing on holy ground. The meaning is clear: God demanded that Moses humble himself in the presence of a holy God.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as you suggested, there is a deeper meaning as well. If you remember, Moses is offered in Scripture as a type (or picture) of the Law. Since we know the Law can never be the means by which men may reach heaven (i.e., we can&#39;t enter heaven by works of the Law), Moses is used frequently as a picture of this truth.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, we know that Moses wasn&#39;t permitted to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. Instead, Moses died in the desert, and Joshua (which is Yeshua in Hebrew or Jesus in Greek) was the one to lead the Israelites into Canaan. Through this example, we see how Moses was used as a type of the Law, in the way the Law cannot lead men to heaven, only Yeshua (Jesus) can.</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, in your example we can also see Moses being used as a type of the Law. The Law was never intend to be the means for redeeming men form sin, as Paul says clearly in Romans 3:20-21:</p>\n<h5>\n\tBecause by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.<br />\n\tBut now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,</h5>\n<p>\n\tSo as a redeemer, Moses was unable to serve God&#39;s purposes. In that sense, he \"removed his sandals\" and it was left to God to be the redeemer of Israel and all men.</p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<em><strong>Q. Shouldn&#39;t the the word translated as \"church\" in most modern Bible translations actually be \"those set apart by God,\" making the \"visible church\" a total fabrication of man and denominations and church buildins as they exist today an abomination to God?</strong></em><br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tA. Regarding the visible church discussed in our Revelation class, we can agree with your statement &ndash; to a point. Certainly, the word for Church in Greek is <em>ekklesia</em>, which means \"of invited guests.\" The Church is a God-made entity comprised of those the Spirit of God invites into the faith. This is the only true Church, which is what we mean when we discuss the \"invisible\" church.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnly those invited by Christ and indwelled by the Holy Spirit are true Christians, and these are the Church exclusively. This group can be said to be invisible, because only God can know who they are with certainty. They are marked by the invisible Spirit of God.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, the \"visible\" church is a term we use to refer to any gather of people in physical buildings under the banner of Christ. For example, when any Christian congregation gathers, it is a visible event (i.e., we can perceive it with our eyes), and so we call this gathering the visible church. Ideally, every gathering would consist entirely of true believers, in which case the visible church and the invisible would always be one and the same.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn reality, this is rarely the case, as many churches have unbelievers gathered unknowingly in their midst. Consequently, we use the term visible church to describe a union of both the true invisible Church (i.e., believers) with the false converts (i.e., unbelievers). This is where we would disagree with your comments. The visible church is a reality (not a fabrication), because it does exist as we&#39;ve defined it. Real, physical buildings with real, living people do exist, and we call these gatherings the visible Church.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, we are not saying that the visible church is comprised entirely of the true, invisible Church of believers. We acknowledge it is usually a mixed gathering of both believers and unbelievers. In the worst case, it is entirely unbelievers (as represented by the church of Laodicea in the book of Revelation), and in the best case it is entirely believers (as represented by the church of Philadelphia).</p>\n<p>\n\tWhether any given visible church is \"an abomination\" to God is a matter of personal opinion, though the Bible does acknowledge the inevitability of unbelievers congregating with believers at times without suggesting it is an abomination (i.e., 1Cor 14:23; Luke 13:19, among others).&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. What will be the state of someone who had accepted Christ as his personal Savior (e.g., a Christian) but still fornicating, when he dies, so far as salvation is concerned?</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. First and foremost, it&rsquo;s important for us to understand how we become a Christian, that is, how we are saved. While I won&rsquo;t list all references here, the following verses are very clear and explicit. They tell us in no uncertain terms that salvation is an act of God, not of man. Put another way, God is completely sovereign over who is and is not saved.</p>\n\n<p>Romans 9:16-18:</p>\n\n<h5>So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, \"FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.\" So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ephesians 1:3-5:</p>\n\n<h5>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Ephesians 2:8-9:</p>\n\n<h5>For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Again, there are many more Scriptures that testify to God&rsquo;s sovereignty in salvation, but these make the point very explicitly and clearly. Furthermore, Scripture makes clear that Jesus did two things for Christians. First, in His death on the cross, Jesus took God&rsquo;s wrath upon Himself, the wrath that every Christian deserved because all mankind sins. By His death, all of our sins (past, present and future) have been forgiven. Second, Christ&rsquo;s own righteousness is imputed, or credited, to the Christian by faith. The following Scriptures make this clear:</p>\n\n<p>Romans 5:8-11:</p>\n\n<h5>But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Romans 4:1-8:</p>\n\n<h5>What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has found? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? \"ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.\" Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: \"BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED. \"BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOSE SIN THE LORD WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Romans 4:22-25:</p>\n\n<h5>Therefore IT WAS ALSO CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS. Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him, but for our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and was raised because of our justification.</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Romans 5:19:</p>\n\n<h5>For as through the one man&#39;s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hebrews 10:10-14:</p>\n\n<h5>By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; 12but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD, waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET. For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, summarizing, we see that we are saved by God&rsquo;s grace, not our own will or works. In addition, our salvation is not contingent on what we do even after we have been saved because we are counted righteous by what Jesus did. Finally, all of our sins have been forgiven by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In this sense, we have already been &ldquo;perfected&rdquo; (Hebrews 10:14) in that God has already punished our sin in Christ on the cross, and we are made perfect by Christ&rsquo;s obedience, with His righteousness credited to the believer.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, this means that if we have truly been saved, we cannot lose our salvation. Remember, Ephesians 2:8 says that salvation is the gift of God. Romans 11:29 says, &ldquo;for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.&rdquo; Therefore, if God has saved us, we are saved forevermore.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let&rsquo;s apply all of this to your question. f a person has truly received God&rsquo;s gracious gift of faith, then that person will go to heaven. His actions after becoming a believer do not determine his salvation because, as we&rsquo;ve shown, salvation is totally due to actions taken on God&rsquo;s part, not man&rsquo;s. Scripture also gives us examples of believers who sinned in major ways. Consider the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Peter, when he denied he even knew Christ (Luke 22:55-62). Of course, Jesus restored and forgave Peter.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-10).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The unnamed believer in 1 Corinthians 5:1-5.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Having said that, our actions as Christians do have consequences, both here and in eternity in heaven. As the examples above attest, God requires that we discipline those in the church who continue in a life of sin. Matthew 18:15-20 gives clear instructions as to how sinning believers are to be handled. Ultimately, if they refuse to stop sinning, we are to put them out of the church. This is for the destruction of their flesh, not that they would lose their salvation (see 1 Cor. 5:1-5), with the ultimate goal of restoring them to fellowship (as Jesus did with Peter). Sadly, this is rarely done in today&rsquo;s church.</p>\n\n<p>The Lord makes clear that He will discipline those He loves. Therefore, if we continue in sin, we can expect to be put out of fellowship with the church, as well as God&rsquo;s chastisement. Hebrews 12:4-7 makes this clear:</p>\n\n<h5>You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin; and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons, \"MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD, NOR FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM; FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.\" It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We also face consequences in heaven in eternity for what we do here on earth as believers. Again, our salvation is not in question, but the level of rewards we will receive in heaven depend on how we serve God while on earth. This is made most clear in 1 Corinthians 3:9-17:</p>\n\n<h5>For we are God&#39;s fellow workers; you are God&#39;s field, God&#39;s building. According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it. For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man&#39;s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man&#39;s work. If any man&#39;s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man&#39;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.&rdquo;&#39;</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Note that in this passage, believers are compared to a building. The foundation of our salvation is Jesus Christ. What we do in this life to serve God (the building) will be tested when we go to heaven. If we have not served God, which would include a believer continuing in sin, then our works will not pass the test. They will be like wood and straw, useless and burned up in the testing fire.</p>\n\n<p>With nothing to show for our lives in service to God, we will still be saved (v. 15), but we will lose any potential rewards. If we have lived a life in service to God, bearing fruit that lasts, our work will be like gold and precious stones, surviving God&rsquo;s testing fire. This will lead to rewards in heaven.</p>\n\n<p>One final point...a person who claims to be a Christian but yet never bears fruit and continues in a habitual life of sin, may not, in fact, be a Christian. (Indeed, Scripture says fornicators will not enter the kingdom of God, refering to those who live a lifestyle marked by this pattern of sin (1 Cor. 6:9).) Obviously, all Christians sin while here on earth, but the issue is one of continuing to practice sin in such a way that it suggests an unchanged (unsaved) heart.</p>\n\n<p>1John 3:7-9 puts it this way:</p>\n\n<h5>Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, some Christians will practice righteousness better than others. Ultimately, however, only God knows who is truly a believer and who is not.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we must be careful that we don&rsquo;t go make subjective judgments as to who is and is not a Christian based on their works. Still, we may have reason to doubt the confession of one who by his works appears to be unchanged. Ideally, of course, we&rsquo;d expect to see some evidence of a changed life in the behavior of a true believer. While there are degrees of change from believer to believer, Scripture tells us that God has prepared us for good works, so this should be our expectation as well.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<h4><em><strong>Q. What does the term \"Lordship Salvation\" mean?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</h4>\n\n<p>A. The term \"Lordship salvation\" originated as part of a theological perspective put forth by pastor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._MacArthur\">John MacArthur</a> in his book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Gospel-According-Jesus-Authentic/dp/0310287294\"><em>The Gospel According to Jesus</em></a>.&nbsp;MacArthur&#39;s controversial thesis claimed that true salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ will also include&nbsp;a&nbsp;willingness&nbsp;to follow Him as an obedient disciple. MacArthur described this mindset as accepting Jesus as both Savior <em>and</em> Lord.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>MacArthur&#39;s thesis was immediately controversial with some in the Christian community, who objected to his&nbsp;requirement of&nbsp;evidence of faith in works of discipleship. His opponents contended MacArthur was conflating the call to believe in Christ with the call to follow Christ as His disciple. The call to believe, they argued,&nbsp;is an&nbsp;invitation to the <em>unbeliever</em> to accept Jesus as Messiah&nbsp;to&nbsp;receive forgiveness and eternal life (e.g., Rom 10:9), while the call to follow is an invitation to the <em>believer</em> to follow Christ in obedience for the opportunity to earn eternal rewards (e.g., 2Cor 5:10).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Charles Ryrie, one of MacArthur&#39;s chief critics, made this observation:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<pre>\nThis Lordship teaching fails to distinguish&#10;salvation from discipleship and makes requirements&#10;for discipleship prerequisites for salvation.&#10;Our Lord distinguished the two (Luke 14:16-33). &#10;This teaching elevates one of the many aspects &#10;of the person of Christ (Master over life) in &#10;making it a part of the Gospel. Why not require &#10;faith in His kingship? Or in the fact that He is &#10;Judge of all, or that He was the Creator? </pre>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nIn response to such criticisms, MacArthur&#39;s supporters point out that increasingly&nbsp;the Church tolerates&nbsp;an incomplete gospel message lacking&nbsp;the power to bring true spiritual change to the heart. False teachers call upon people&nbsp;to \"come to Jesus\" to receive His forgiveness yet fail to call for repentance and a commitment to&nbsp;follow the Lord as His disciple. MacArthur&#39;s supporters label this \"easy believism,\" claiming it isn&#39;t the (complete) Gospel message.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Our View</h4>\n\n<p>While we agree with MacArthur that many false teachers and false gospels threaten&nbsp;the Church (and always will), and we agree that a biblically&nbsp;correct presentation of the Gospel is essential to reaching the world for Christ, nevertheless&nbsp;we also believe that making a distinction between believing&nbsp;in Jesus as Savior vs. believing in Him&nbsp;as Lord&nbsp;is an unbiblical distinction lacking&nbsp;practical application while risking dividing believers.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we hold that to <em>truly</em>&nbsp;believe in Jesus as Savior always includes believing&nbsp;in Him as Lord and vice versa. In other words, the words \"savior\" and \"lord\" are synonyms in the context of biblical saving faith.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Furthermore, there is no example in scripture of a person truly believing&nbsp;in Jesus as Savior yet&nbsp;refusing to acknowledge Jesus as Lord. </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">On the contrary, all who fail to accept Jesus as Lord also reject Him as Messiah (e.g., Luke 6:45-49).&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Moreover, the Bible never defines saving faith as acknowledging both&nbsp;these aspects of Jesus specifically, because in practice they are inseparable.</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In fact,&nbsp;even if someone should attempt to preach such a false&nbsp;Gospel (e.g., \"Believe in Jesus as your Savior, but pay no attention to His commandments...\"), such a message would either save no one at all, or even if by God&#39;s grace the message brought a person to saving faith, then the Spirit will bring that person to know&nbsp;Christ in all respects. To the true believer, Jesus will always be Savior, Lord, King, High Priest, Judge, and Creator.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">While s</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">cripture does teach that a&nbsp;lack of obedience to the word of God&nbsp;casts doubt on any claim&nbsp;to identity in Christ (<em>see Luke 6:46</em>), </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">there is no promise in scripture that a believe will <em>always</em> obey Christ</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;enough for others to notice</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">. </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Neither does scripture equate obedience with God&#39;s word to our identity in Christ. Just as a</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;child may not obey his parents on occasion, a</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">ll believers</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;will demonstrate varying&nbsp;degrees of obedience. Remember, all believers&nbsp;are saved from the moment of faith <em>even before we have taken a single step of obedience</em>!</span></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the Lordship Salvation debate&nbsp;holds no value for the church, since&nbsp;it offers no new insight or direction for dealing with \"easy believism\" beyond preaching the word (2Tim 4:2). Those who&nbsp;agree with the Lordship Salvation position will seek to counteract easy believism by&nbsp;preaching the true Gospel.&nbsp;Likewise, those who have never heard of MacArthur&#39;s Lordship Salvation will continue&nbsp;preaching&nbsp;the true Gospel as well. In other words, regardless of our perspective on this esoteric debate, the right response is the same, so why entertain the discussion at all?</p>\n\n<p>This is why we say this debate serves no practical purpose in the Christian experience.&nbsp;The discussion is academic at best and divisive at worst. Instead, we believe the church should unite in preaching and teaching the word in Spirit and Truth, acknowledging that truth faith comes solely as a consequence of the Spirit of God by the power of God. In doing so, we will address any concerns over \"easy believism\" while avoiding distractions that might divide the body.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Speaking of division,&nbsp;we believe the debate over Lordship Salvation has become opportunity for the enemy to drive a wedge between believers. In our experience, some&nbsp;in the Lordship \"camp\" distort&nbsp;the Lordship Salvation teaching well beyond MacArthur&#39;s own ideas&nbsp;to create a litmus test for true faith.&nbsp;These maintain that&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">all who claims faith in Jesus Christ must&nbsp;demonstrate a changed life&nbsp;or else the Church should assume their claims to faith in Christ were false.</span></p>\n\n<p>Not only does this perspective lie outside the boundaries of scripture, it holds great potential for inflicting harm within the body of Christ.&nbsp;While the Bible teaches that being born again by the Spirit is accompanied by&nbsp;spiritual fruit,&nbsp;scripture does <em>not</em> guarantee such fruit (i.e., life change) will be clearly or immediately evident&nbsp;in the life of every believer.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, the Bible suggests the opposite is likely, especially in those who fail to undertake a serious effort to mature:</p>\n\n<h5>Heb. 6:1 &nbsp;Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:2 of instruction about washings and laying on of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:3 And this we will do, if God permits.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:4 For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:5 and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:6 and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open shame.&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:7 For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God;&nbsp;<br />\nHeb. 6:8 but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;Bible teaches&nbsp;it is <em>possible</em> for a believer&nbsp;in Jesus Christ to&nbsp;live in disobedience to the Lord - even to the point of appearing very unchristian. We can grieve the Holy Spirit and disobey the Lord and&nbsp;bring shame to Christ in the process. When we do such things, we&nbsp;risk the Lord&#39;s discipline and a loss of eternal reward. These consequences demonstrate it is possible for a believer to live in disobedience to the Spirit.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Clearly, disobedience is possible, or else such exhortations would serve</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;no useful purpose.&nbsp;</span>Some proponents of lordship salvation&nbsp;have argued against such a possibility, citing scripture like <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_romans\">Romans 12:1-2</a> or <a href=\"/bible-studies/the-gospel-of-john\">John 14:15-24</a> (among other passages) to support their views, but we believe they incorrectly interpret&nbsp;these&nbsp;passages to arrive at their perspective (please listen to our Romans and John studies to hear our interpretation of these passages).</p>\n\n<p>In short, any attempt to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between justification and sanctification is mistaken, because it presumes too much concerning&nbsp;man&#39;s propensity to obey Christ&#39;s commands. Every&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">believer walks in obedience to the Lord by&nbsp;yielding to the Spirit (Titus 3:5; Eph 5:26). The Bible calls believers to yield to the Spirit and obey His direction for the promise of an eternal reward,&nbsp;yet not every believer will yield. The very fact that the scriptures remind us over and over again of the need to obey is evidence that not all believers do obey.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Secondly, it is possible that a person could obey&nbsp;Jesus as Lord (i.e., to show spiritual fruit in their walk) but do it to&nbsp;such a limited degree that the change is not visible outwardly to others.&nbsp;For example, a person&rsquo;s thoughts and beliefs could become more Christ-like in some small way without others noticing, or their behaviors could change in private ways. These&nbsp;possibilities&nbsp;deny&nbsp;the lordship teaching.</span></p>\n\n<p>We cannot insist that salvation always means demonstrating outward Spiritual fruit, because we assume wrongly that we will always have enough discernment and opportunity to witness such progress in a person&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;When we teach that salvation must always involve&nbsp;obeying Jesus \"as Lord,\" we add a extra requirement for salvation beyond&nbsp;the Bible&#39;s teaching that salvation is by faith alone.</p>\n\n<p>We regret the emergence of this trend in the church for a litmus test, and we see it as an unfortuante consequence of the Lorship teaching.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. How do you know when to interpret scripture literally?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. VBVM takes a high view of scripture. We believe the Bible is the authoritative Word of God, not based on the testimony of any man or even the church, but rather upon God Himself, Who has revealed Himself in the hearts of believers by His Spirit to be the Author of Scripture (1Cor 1:18).</p>\n\n<p>Scripture is, therefore, to be taught and received as the final authority in all matters of doctrine and Christian living. (See also 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:16; Hebrews 6:13; 2 Peter 1:19-21; 1 John 5:9 among others.)</p>\n\n<p>As we teach and apply God&rsquo;s word, we follow the Golden Rule of interpretation, (formulated by Dr. David L. Cooper of the Biblical Research Society), which states:</p>\n\n<p>When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense. In other words, take every word of Scripture at its primary, ordinary, usual, literal meaning, unless the facts of the immediate context, studied in the light of related passages and axiomatic and fundamental Biblical truths, indicate otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>In practical terms, this means we teach Scripture literally, emphasizing the historical and theological context, while recognizing Scripture&rsquo;s occasional use of symbols, figures, parables and other non-literal pictures to illustrate Biblical truth. In all cases, we rely on the context of Scripture to determine when to take a literal or figurative view of the text.</p>\n\n<p>In many cases, the text of Scripture actually offers both a figurative and a literal meaning. For example, Genesis 1 teaches that God created all things in six literal days and rested on the seven day. While this chapter should be interpreted as a literal truth (when interpreted according to the Golden Rule), the text also uses the reality of a seven-day creation as a symbol to teach other truths.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, God chose to create the world in six days and rest on the seventh so that He could communicate something beyond the facts of the Creation. (For a deeper explanation of how this was so, please see our Genesis study.)</p>\n\n<p>So literal truth and symbols often work together in Scripture to teach us more than either by itself, so long as we don&#39;t make one the enemy of the other.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Why are Christians feared or hated? For example after Saul had his Damascus Road experience, he was doubted by other disciples until Barnabus spoke out on his behalf. Why would they fear a fellow Christian? In general, why are Christians perceived negatively by the world, and how we might change that perspective?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. First, Christians are often maligned for their faith, and the the Bible says that Christians will be hated by the world, because we are not \"of the world.\"</p>\n\n<p>Jesus taught this most forcefully in John 15:18:</p>\n\n<h6>If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the wrld, because of this the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, &lsquo;A slave is not greater than his master.&rsquo; If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word, they will keep yours also. But all these things they will do to you for My name&rsquo;s sake, because they do not know the One who sent Me.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>In other words, it is natural and expected that Christians should be mocked and rejected by the unbelieving world, just as Jesus Himself was. The Bible also teaches us that we should take some measure of comfort in that rejection, as Jesus said in Matthew 5:11-12:</p>\n\n<h6>Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also important to remember that we should not seek the world&#39;s approval or try to become like the world so that they might accept us, as Jesus taught in Matthew 5:13-16:</p>\n\n<h6>You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>So all Christians should understand and accept that our new life in Christ has made us different from the rest of the world to such a degree that reconciliation isn&#39;t possible nor desireable. Unbelievers will alienate us and even hate us at times for Jesus&#39; sake. The Bible says this is the natural and intended state of affairs, since our difference in the world is our witness.</p>\n\n<p>While we wish to be at peace with all men so far as it depends upon us (Romans 12:18), we also remember that we cannot seek the approval of men over the approval of God:</p>\n\n<h6>Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers used to treat the false prophets in the same way. - Luke 6:26<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Having said that, we can certainly make reasonable efforts to avoid conflict with others, and even to work and live closely with unbelievers. Paul himself did this routinely, and he taught that he was willing to become \"all things to all men\" in an effort to win some to Christ. Obviously, Paul didn&#39;t compromise His closely-held Christian beliefs or morals, but he was willing to forgo virtually everything else if it might increase his chances of winning men to Christ. Paul describes it this way in 1Cor 9:20-23:</p>\n\n<h6>To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win Jews; to those who are under the Law, as under the Law though not being myself under the Law, so that I might win those who are under the Law; to those who are without law, as without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law. To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some. I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of it.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>We should seek to reduce the potential conflict we may experience with unbelievers by approaching them without pretense or judgment. Christians should avoid showing pride or hautiness from our faith, and we can&#39;t carry a superior attitude among those who are without Christ, since their sins are no greater than our own and our faith is a gift, as Paul taught:</p>\n\n<h6>Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear; -&nbsp;Rom 11:20<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Showing genuinely kindness and sincere interest in the the lives and circumstances of others will go a long way toward opening doors of conversation for the sake of Gospel. Nevertheless, a Christian must never forget that strife and rejection and hatred will come sooner or later, for the Lord has said it is inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the example you offered of Saul is probably not relevant to your question, since the circumstance of Saul&#39;s arrival in Damascus were quite unique. The people who met him in Damascus were Christians, not unbelievers, and they were frightened and wary of Saul not because he was a Christian. On the contrary, they were wary because they suspected he wasn&#39;t a true Christian.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of Saul&#39;s conversion and delivery into Damascus, the early church only knew Saul as the man who persecuted and murdered Christians, so when they learned that Saul was staying with Christians in their city, no one knew if they could trust him. Their reluctance to accept Saul was not because they didn&#39;t know how to accept Christians.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, they were Christians who didn&#39;t know whether to trust Saul, because they couldn&#39;t understand how God had changed Saul so suddenly. Only after time did everyone come to accept that Saul was truly now Paul, a man who knew and followed Jesus as Messiah.&nbsp;</p>"

Can you suggest some good practices for a pastor to follow in seeking accountability?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Ultimately, a pastor is accountable to the Lord (as are all believers), but earthly accountability is also essential to preserving godly leadership.</p>\n\n<p>A pastor (and all church leadership) should be held accountable by three principle means: a <a href=\"/devotionals/presbuteros_episkopos_diakonos\">plurality of leadership</a>, regular transparent communication and carefully established boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>As Paul directs Titus and Timothy, Church leadership should consist of a plurality of servant-leaders. The plurality serves three principle purposes: it diversifies gifting within leadership, it encourages members of the Body to seek opportunities to serve in leadership (i.e., 1Tim 3:1), and it militates against corruption and pride among those who assume authority. Shared responsibility for God&rsquo;s people minimizes the potential for one man to inflate his pride and abuse his position or those under his charge.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, a pastor must engage in regular, transparent communication with other leaders or trusted counselors. These conversations, conducted in an atmosphere of trust and agape love, give opportunity for a pastor to confess his sin to a brother and receive honest feedback concerning his behaviors and decisions.</p>\n\n<p>To be effective, these meetings cannot be optional or &ldquo;as needed;&rdquo; they must be regular opportunities that include an expectation that personal confession will take place in keeping with 1John 1:8.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, pastors must exercise self-discipline by establishing personal boundaries that protect against even the appearance of impropriety. For example, personal boundaries should include never meeting alone (or riding in a car, etc.) with a woman other than a wife; never obtaining unmonitored access to ministry funds, etc. While these stipulations cannot by themselves prevent sin, they do offer a degree of protection against personal temptation and false accusations.</p>"

The Biblical model for church discipline is classically found in Matthew 18:15-21, with New Testament commentary also found in 1Tim 5:20 and James 5:19-20. The principles expressed in these verses can be summarized as:</p>\n\n<p>1. A person&rsquo;s decision to engage in willful sinning is harmful to the individual and to the Body as a whole, and therefore the church is under obligation to undertake loving discipline.</p>\n\n<p>2. Someone with firsthand knowledge of the sin should correct the sinning Christian privately, seeking to win him over.</p>\n\n<p>3. Should that fail, the sinner should be approached by a plurality of church representatives who will affirm the judgment of the first.</p>\n\n<p>4. If this fails, the church is informed of the matter for the purpose of enlisting the support of the entire congregation in turning the unrepentant Christian from the sin. This is a last resort.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the individual is placed outside the fellowship of the congregation, as a matter of discipline to the individual and to protect the Body from the harmful influences of the person&rsquo;s habitual sin.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, these principles can be difficult to apply (particularly steps 4 and 5), since public discussions of personal indiscretions may risk a claim of defamation of character, invasion of privacy or other legal challenges.</p>\n\n<p>In our experience, the first three steps outlined above are usually enough to settle the matter, since most people will either respond positively to private discipline or voluntarily leave the church in protest. Nevertheless, church leaders must be prepared for the necessity of engaging in discipline when required for the sake of the Body and the Name of Christ.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. John&#39;s Gospel says that \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God...\" I don&#39;t understand the meaning of \"the Word?\" Is the \"Word\" a person? How can a word be God?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The prologue of John&#39;s gospel is an important work within the New Testament, because it provides perhaps the clearest statement of Who Jesus was in spiritual terms. Essentially, John&#39;s prologue states that Jesus was God, but it also seeks to explain, to a certain extent, the nature of Jesus&#39; existence and His role within the Godhead.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s start by examining the opening verses in John&#39;s Gospel:</p>\n\n<h6>John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br />\nJohn 1:2 He was in the beginning with God.<br />\nJohn 1:3 All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>John uses the Greek word logos to describe Jesus \"in the beginning,\" or before creation and time began. Logos means word, but specifically it means the spoken word or a statement. Jesus is God&#39;s spoken word, according to John.</p>\n\n<p>John then explains that the Word (Jesus) was \"with\" God and \"was\" God. This statement yields two important conclusions regarding Jesus and the Trinity: Jesus is God and existed from the beginning as God, yet Jesus&#39; existence is somehow distinct from God the Father. Jesus was \"with\" God and \"was\" God at the same time. This is the mystery of the Trinity: all three Persons in the Godhead are One God and yet all are distinct from one another.</p>\n\n<p>Moving to verse 3, John says that it was the Word (Him) that created all things. From this statement, we begin to see why Jesus is called the \"Word\" by John. Consider these facts we learn from John&#39;s Gospel and elsewhere in Scripture:</p>\n\n<p>First, we know from scripture that God the Father is Spirit (John 4:24), meaning He doesn&#39;t exist in physical form. So, there is no physical substance to God the Father. The Creation cannot experience the Father as He truly is, since we are bound to a physical dimension yet He is not physical.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we know that God&#39;s Spirit is likewise invisible (John 3:6-8). He can only be known by observing His work in the Creation.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Jesus is the member of the Godhead responsible for all physical matter. As John said, all things were made by and through Jesus. Paul says the same thing in Col 1:15-17.</p>\n\n<p>More over, Paul teaches in Colossians that Jesus is the \"image of the invisible God.\" Therefore, He is the only Person in the Godhead Who has entered into and become a part of the physical creation. Jesus can be seen in a physical sense, because He is the One Who entered into the Creation and become a part of it (i.e., became incarnate).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Jesus is the One within the Trinity Who is associated with Creation, both as its source and as an ambassador of the Godhead to that creation.</p>\n\n<p>Next, consider how the Creation itself was established in Genesis 1. Genesis 1 teaches that the world was created by the spoken word of God (note the repeating phrase in Genesis 1, \"Then God said...\"). So when God the Father determined to created the universe and everything in it, He \"spoke\" it into existence. But as John said in verse 3, Jesus was the One who made all things, therefore we can say that Jesus was God&#39;s logos, or spoken Word.</p>\n\n<p>We can begin to understand this partnership (at least to some degree) by drawing an analogy to how our own thoughts and words reach into the physical word. When we desire to command something to happen in the world around us, we must first conceive the idea in our minds. No one can see our thoughts. They are invisible, yet they certainly exist. Without our thoughts, we could purpose to do nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p>If our thoughts are to become visible in some way, they must move from the invisible realm of our mind and into the physical world. The progression from invisible to visible requires we transfer our invisible thoughts into a spoken command. The brain communicates our thoughts to our mouth where it becomes logos: spoken words.</p>\n\n<p>Once the spoken word leaves our mouth, it enters the physical world and yields its intended effect. This simple analogy helps explain how God the Father worked with God the Son (i.e., the Word) to establish Creation.</p>\n\n<p>This is John&#39;s meaning when he says that Jesus is the Word. He meant that Jesus is the physical manifestation of God the Father, just as a spoken word is the physical manifestation of our inner thoughts. Until Jesus took action and created the universe, there was no physical reality to God&#39;s presence. But when God \"spoke\" (i.e., when Jesus took action), the Creation came into existence.</p>\n\n<p>Later, Jesus arrived in Person to meet with His creation, and as Jesus spoke His words to His disciples, He fulfilled the Father&#39;s purpose by providing a physical representation of the Godhead to His creation. Hebrews says it this way:</p>\n\n<h6>Heb. 1:1 God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways,<br />\nHeb. 1:2 in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.<br />\nHeb. 1:3 And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power...<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Paul reiterates this same thought in Colossians when he says:</p>\n\n<h6>Col. 1:15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.<br />\nCol. 1:16 For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities &mdash; all things have been created through Him and for Him.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Jesus is the Word because He was the means through which the Father brought all physical reality into existence and because He is the One Who represents the Father&#39;s invisible nature and character to that creation. Just as your spoken word is the physical manifestation of your thoughts and personality, Jesus is the \"Word\" of the invisible God to His creation.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. In John 1:47-51, why did Jesus use the phrase \"without guile\" to describe Nathaniel&rsquo;s character? And did Jesus physically see Nathaniel under the fig tree or did He see him while praying prior to their actual meeting? Finally, why did Nathaniel, after what seems to be only a brief exchange of greetings, acknowledge Jesus as the Son of God? I wouldn&#39;t expect Christ&#39;s words would be enough to lead Nathaniel to immediately acknowledging Jesus as the Son of God.&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. In John 1, Jesus meets Nathaniel. Jesus declares as He meets Nathaniel that Nathaniel is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit (or guile). This statement had double meaning and was a play on words. First, Nathaniel had earlier commented to Philip that the Messiah couldn&#39;t be from Nazareth, because \"can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" Obviously, Nathaniel&#39;s statement demonstrated a complete lack of faith in Jesus.</p>\n\n<p>In response to Nathaniel&#39;s cutting comment concerning Jesus, the Lord offered His own cutting assessment of Nathaniel. Jesus said that Nathaniel was an Israelite in whom there was no deceit, but the use of the Greek word dolos (which means deceit or crafty) was a play on the name of Jacob, whose name meant deceiver or crafty in Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>Jacob became Israel, the father of the twelve tribes of Israel, so what Jesus said, in effect, was Nathaniel was an Israelite in whom there was no \"Jacob\" or no true Israel. He was an Israelite by birth, but by his lack of faith Nathaniel was not a true descendent of Israel spiritually.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Jesus was speaking prophetically about what Nathaniel would speak next. After Jesus confronted him and revealed Himself to be the Christ, Nathaniel declared that Jesus was the Son of God, the King of Israel. By this statement, Nathaniel spoke truly, and therefore Nathaniel&#39;s declaration was trustworthy and in him was no deceit.</p>\n\n<p>To your second question about Jesus&#39; vision, it&#39;s clear that Jesus \"saw\" Nathaniel in a spiritual sense prior to ever meeting him. Notice in verse 47 that Jesus noticed Nathaniel coming to Jesus, which means that Nathaniel had already left the tree and was walking to meet Jesus. Jesus makes His cutting remark about Nathaniel as He watches Nathaniel approaching Him, and then as they talk Jesus confides that He knew of Nathaniel from long ago.</p>\n\n<p>Jesus is referring to God&#39;s election of His children before even the foundation of the Earth. Paul describes this knowledge in Ephesians 1:</p>\n\n<h5>Eph. 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,<br />\nEph. 1:4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love<br />\nEph. 1:5 He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,<br />\nEph. 1:6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.<br />\n&nbsp;</h5>\n\n<p>Jesus demonstrated His Deity to Nathaniel simply in revealing to Nathaniel something that no mere man could have known: that Philip had called to Nathaniel while Nathaniel was sitting under a fig tree. Nathaniel knew Jesus had not been present in that moment nor had Philip left Nathaniel&#39;s side since then, so how could Jesus have known this information? Jesus&#39; statement shocked Nathaniel, and prompted him to declare that Jesus was the Son of God.</p>\n\n<p>Was Jesus&#39; simple statement the thing that converted Nathaniel? Not exactly. The Holy Spirit must have been at work in Nathaniel prior to the moment of Jesus arrival so that once Jesus appeared and spoke to Nathaniel, his response would be assured. This is the meaning of Paul&#39;s statement in 1Cor 12:3:</p>\n\n<h5>1Cor. 12:3 Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, &ldquo;Jesus is accursed&rdquo;; and no one can say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; except by the Holy Spirit.</h5>\n\n<p>All men are brought to a saving faith in Christ in precisely the same manner: we are drawn to Christ by the Holy Spirit, Who convicts all men of sin and brings a repentance that leads to salvation. This repentance is the work of God by His Spirit, and it prepares the heart to receive the Gospel (see Acts 11:18; Rom 2:4; 2Cor 7:9; 2Tim 2:25). Obviously, Nathaniel had received the call of the Spirit, so that once Jesus spoke to him, Nathaniel was ready to believe. It only required that Jesus reveal Himself to Nathaniel for his faith to be established.</p>"

Though all Christians believe in the eternal existence of Christ (see John 1), there is still debate as to if and when Jesus appeared in the Old Testament. We believe (as do many Bible scholars) that Jesus appears repeated in the OT, often as the Angel of the Lord, including in the scene you mentioned from Genesis 18. Nevertheless, not all scholars agree on which OT scenes contain appearances of Christ or even if such appearances happened at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, Bible editors generally do not apply the red lettering technique in the OT due to the uncertainty over which words belong to Christ. Remember, when a Bible&#39;s editors choose to mark Jesus&#39; words using red ink, they are offering an interpretation of the text in the sense that they are deciding for the reader which words were spoken by Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince this is a matter of judgment, many Bibles use no red lettering at all, and the ones that do highlight Christ&#39;s words do so sparingly, usually limiting their use of red lettering to the words Jesus clearly spoke in the New Testament (i.e., the Gospel and Revelation). If editors were to extend their use of red letters to the OT, they would be forced to make increasingly difficult determinations for which words belonged to Christ.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsequently, do not base your own interpretation of the Bible on how an editor may have chosen to color the text.

It&rsquo;s always best to agree on a definition of terms before discussing an issue. From its Latin roots the word &ldquo;sacrament&rdquo; can mean an oath, or pledge. From its French roots, it can mean sacred, or consecrated. Since both views are evident in the way sacraments have been used historically in the church, perhaps the fairest definition of sacrament used in a church context is &ldquo;a visible sign of an inward grace.&rdquo; It is God&rsquo;s grace that consecrates us, or sets us apart, and sacraments are a visible, outward reminder or sign of God&#39;s grace.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/SacramentsPoussin.jpg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 470px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px 10px; float: left;\" />Sacraments are rightly viewed as having been instituted by the Lord Jesus. According to most Protestants, Scripture teaches the Lord instituted only two sacraments: baptism and the Lord&#39;s Supper. The Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches believe there are seven sacraments: baptism, confirmation, the Lord&rsquo;s supper, matrimony, penance, holy orders, and extreme unction.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe agree with the Biblical view that baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s supper are the only two sacraments given by Jesus to the Church. We believe this view is substantiated by Scripture in that Jesus commanded believers to be baptized (Matthew 28:19) and to celebrate the Lord&rsquo;s supper in remembrance of Him (Luke 22:19) but made no command or even mention of the remaining sacraments practiced by the Catholic Church.</p>\n<p>\n\tScripture is also very clear that these two sacraments are symbolic, visible signs of an inward grace. That is to say, these sacraments themselves do not actually confer grace; they represent the grace already made available to believers. Consequently, sacraments bear no relationship to our salvation. For example, being baptized does not make one a Christian, and conversely failing to be baptized does not invalidate a person&#39;s faith or salvation.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur clearest evidence of this Biblical truth is seen in the experience of the thief on the cross. He was not baptized nor did he participate in communion, yet the Lord said he would be with Him in Paradise that day. Also, if you review the circumstances of every person in the New Testament who is credited with salvation by faith in Christ, each person is shown to confess belief in Christ before they are baptized. Therefore, Scripture makes clear that the sacrament of Baptism follows conversion and salvation and never precedes it nor accomplishes it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the Lord&rsquo;s supper, Jesus makes it clear that this was to be done in remembrance of Him, just as the Jews had been commanded to celebrate Passover as a remembrance of the day the Lord passed over their first born while still in Egypt. Nowhere in Scripture are we told we must partake of the Lord&rsquo;s supper to be saved, nor does Scripture describe any imparting of additional grace as a result of our participation in it (other than the general blessing God assigns to acts of obedience).</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, We also believe Christians should be baptized and should observe the Lord&rsquo;s supper, because Jesus commanded us to do so. These actions demonstrate to the world that God has set us apart, that we are His. They also cause us to remember what the Lord has done for us on the cross.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding magisterium, we assume you are using the term to refer to the Catholic church&rsquo;s (self-proclaimed) inerrancy in teaching. There can be no man-made institution which is inerrant in the view of Scripture, since the Biblie teaches that all men comprehend God&#39;s truth imperfectly in our present sinful condition (1Cor 13:12).</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Catholic church in the Council of Trent declared that sacraments are necessary for salvation, but as we discussed above, Scripture does not agree with this view, as the Lord did not command believers to observe the other five sacraments (matrimony, penance, holy orders, and extreme unction). Furthermore, the sacraments are never tied to our salvation in any way (except that they may follow salvation). Consequently, since the Catholic church&#39;s teaching on sacraments is inconsistent with Scripture, this demonstrates that the doctrine of magisterium is also false (i.e., the Catholic church does make mistakes).<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

Does this mean that it&#39;s possible for names to be blotted out?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. There are several passages in the Bible that speak about the Book of Life. Some passages speak about names being written in the Book of Life, some about names not being written in the Book of Life, and some about names being blotted out of the Book of Life. Scripture clearly teaches that a true believer in Christ cannot have his name blotted out of the Book of Life and that an unbelievers&rsquo; names never were in the Book of Life.</p>\n\n<p>First, Scripture tells us that it is God who chooses who is and who is not saved. There are many passages that demonstrate this, but we&rsquo;ll look at only one here, Ephesians 1:3-6.</p>\n\n<h6 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him.

Consequently, this means that believers&rsquo; names were written in the Book of Life before God made the world.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span _fck_bookmark=\"1\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/revelation_churches.jpg\" style=\"width: 380px; height: 254px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;\" /><span _fck_bookmark=\"1\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>These passages do not prove, however, that unbelievers&rsquo; names were never in the Book of Life and then later blotted out. Fortunately, scripture does explicitly tell us this elsewhere, as we see in the following passages.</p>\n\n<h6 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&ldquo;All who dwell on the earth will worship him [i.e., the beast], everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life of the Lamb who has been slain.&rdquo; (Revelation 13:8)</em></h6>\n\n<h6 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&ldquo;The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose name has not been written in the Book of Life the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will come.&rdquo; (Revelation 17:8)</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>Both of these passages clearly describe unbelievers as those whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world. Taken together, these passages can only mean that believers&rsquo; names are written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, and can never be blotted out. Likewise, unbelievers&rsquo; names were never written in the book of life, and therefore were never blotted out from it.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, there are three passages in Scripture that refer to&nbsp;names being blotted out (or erased) from&nbsp;the book of life, as shown below.</p>\n\n<h6 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\"Then Moses returned to the LORD, and said, \"Alas, this people has committed a great sin, and they have made a god of gold for themselves. \"But now, if You will, forgive their sin--and if not, please blot me out from Your book which You have written!\" The LORD said to Moses, \"Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.&rdquo; (Exodus 32:31-33)</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Notice in this passage Moses speaks of a \"book,\" but he doesn&#39;t name the book. Given the context of the circumstances, the natural conclusion is the book of the Law. Moses is saying that if Israel is to be cut out of the covenant, then Moses offers himself to be a sacrifice in place of Israel. God confirms that any who have sinned against Him are botted out of the book of the Law.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Since the Law is not a means to salvation, God was not saying a person was being cut off from Heaven. He was saying they would be cut out of the nation Israel, since all Israel was required to abide by the covenant of the Law. Therefore, this is not an example of a name being blotted out of the book of Life.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">A second passage sometimes cited as a removal of a name from the Book of LIfe is:</span></p>\n\n<h6 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>&ldquo;For they have persecuted him whom You Yourself have smitten, And they tell of the pain of those whom You have wounded. Add iniquity to their iniquity, And may they not come into Your righteousness. May they be blotted out of the book of life And may they not be recorded with the righteous.&rdquo; (Psalm 69:26-28)</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>This is a Messianic psalm, where David is asking God to not let those who persecuted the Messiah be saved. Note that although he asks for their names to be &ldquo;blotted out of the book of life,\" he also asks that &ldquo;they not be recorded with the righteous.\"</p>\n\n<p>A psalm is a poem, and in&nbsp;Hebrew&nbsp;poetry, the goal isn&#39;t to rhyme words but to match phrases of similar meaning. In Psalm 69:28 we find a matched pair of statements, which are intended to say the exact same thing in different ways. The first phrase says \"May they be blotted out of the book of life,\" while the second phrase says, \"And may they not be recorded with the righteous.\"&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, these two statements are contradictory. Either you are blotted out OR you are not recorded in the first place. This tells us that these phrases are not intended to be taken literally. Rather they are two poetic ways of expressing the same idea: hold the guilty under punishment.&nbsp;As we saw earlier, believers&rsquo; names are written from before the foundation of the world in the Book of Life, since they are predestined to salvation by the Lord, while unbelievers&rsquo; names are never recorded in the Book of Life.</p>\n\n<p>A third passage is found in Revelation:</p>\n\n<h6>Rev. 3:5 &lsquo;He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.</h6>\n\n<p>This verse carries the <u>suggestion</u> of a believer being erased from the book of life, but that suggestion is unintentional. Notice carefully what Jesus says and what He doesn&#39;t say. Jesus explicitly says He will <u>not</u> erase a believer&#39;s name, and Jesus <u>never</u> says He&nbsp;will&nbsp;erase a believer&#39;s name. Nevertheless, because Jesus issued His promise using&nbsp;a double negative (i.e.,&nbsp;not erase) in v.5, some assume His statement implies erasure could be possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In reality, our translation of the Greek language into English is to blame for this wrong assumption. A double negative in Greek adds emphasis without necessarily implying that the opposite condition is possible. So Jesus spoke in a double negative to emphasize the impossibility of being erased from the book of life rather than to imply the possibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Putting it all together, we see that believers&rsquo; names have always been in the book of life (from before the foundation of the world), and unbelievers&rsquo; names have never been in the book of life (also from before the foundation of the world), and there is no scripture claiming that God adds or erases a name afterward.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Therefore, we know from scripture that God does not blot anyone&rsquo;s name out of His Book of Life. All who are supposed to be written in His book are written there, as it was always God&#39;s purpose to save them. In this we should rejoice, just as Jesus told His disciples in Luke 10:</span></p>\n\n<h6 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\"Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will injure you. \"Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.&rdquo;</em><br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p><br />\nYou also be interested in our article on <a href=\"/bible-answers/can_i_lose_my_salvation\">Can I Lose My Salvation?</a></p>"

                "body": "<p>\n\t<strong><em>Q. Can you shed some light on Acts 17:30? Is this verse telling Christians, having received liberty from Law through Jesus Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, that we have no excuse for continued existence in sin?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n\tA. Let&rsquo;s look at the verse in context:</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Acts 17, Paul is preaching the gospel in Thessalonica. Because of his preaching, the unbelieving Jews become upset and attacked Paul. He escapes to Berea, and the same Jews proceeded to follow him there. This forces Paul to travel farther to Athens.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile he is waiting for Silas and Timothy in Athens, Paul continues to preach the gospel, both to the Jews in the synagogues and the Gentiles in the market place.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s important to note that Scripture says Paul&rsquo;s spirit is provoked or angered by the idolatry he sees in Athens (Acts 17:16). This is Paul&#39;s state of mind when we find him in reasoning with the Gentiles in the marketplace and the Areopagus.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis sets the context for Paul&rsquo;s speech to the unbelieving Gentiles:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n\t<em>Acts 17:24 &ldquo;The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;<br />\n\tActs 17:25 nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things;<br />\n\tActs 17:26 and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,<br />\n\tActs 17:27 that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;<br />\n\tActs 17:28 for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, &lsquo;For we also are His children.&rsquo;<br />\n\tActs 17:29 &ldquo;Being then the children of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man.<br />\n\tActs 17:30 &ldquo;Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent.<br />\n\tActs 17:31 because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding your question, the first thing to note is that Paul in not talking to Christians, but to unbelieving Gentiles. Therefore, this passage doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say in respect to a Christians&rsquo; continued existence in sin. Rather, Paul is telling these Gentiles, who obviously practice idolatry (17:16, 22-23), how God will no longer overlook their idolatrous ways. Remember, Paul&rsquo;s spirit is angered by all the idolatry he saw.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Paul says God &ldquo;overlooked the times of ignorance,\" he does not mean God will not hold them accountable for their sins when they die. Romans 3 tells us that no one is righteous and that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Romans 1 tells us that what may be known of God is evident in creation and within men&rsquo;s conscience, yet men do not honor Him as God.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy &ldquo;overlook,\" Paul simply means God did not punish men by judging them earlier and wiping them of the face of the Earth, as He was prepared to do. Rather, God tolerated sin in the world because He was waiting for a certain time in which He would display His righteousness. In this sense, they were &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo; because Christ had not yet come into the world, lived, died and been resurrected. Romans 3 puts it this way:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n\t<em>Rom. 3:21 But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,<br />\n\tRom. 3:22 even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;<br />\n\tRom. 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,<br />\n\tRom. 3:24 being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;<br />\n\tRom. 3:25 whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed;<br />\n\tRom. 3:26 for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. </em></p>\n<p>\n\tGod &ldquo;passed over&rdquo; the sins previously committed when he withheld His judgement against humanity, and He did so because He was waiting for the time Christ would come into the world and demonstrate His righteousness. Now that Jesus has come, Paul is declaring that there is now no longer a barrier to God bring judgment upon the world for its sins.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a sense, Paul was saying the world is living on borrowed time, and every day could be its last. Therefore, God requires us to repent if we are to avoid the coming judgment, because those who hear the gospel will be judged by their knowledge of Jesus. We know the gospel message is true, because God has raised Him from the dead. In this sense, those who hear the gospel have no excuse, because God&rsquo;s righteousness has been made manifest to them.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

Is this Bible too \"watered down\" to use in learning the Christian walk and teachings of Christ?</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The Life Application Study Bible is not a translation of Scripture in itself, but rather it is a series of study Bibles that add commentary and study notes to commonly-accepted translations like the NIV, NASB, NKJV, etc. So, the scripture within these Bibles are no different that in other Bibles that use the same translations.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the specific translation you select, these Bible can be perfectly acceptable study Bibles. For example, our ministry favors the NASB translation, so if you were to use the NASB Life Application Study Bible, you would be studying the same translation we use in our teaching.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the study notes included in the Life Application Study Bible (or any study Bible) are not inspired teaching. They are merely interpretations of scripture written by scholars or teachers in an effort to help students understand and apply the Bible, but in many cases these notes can be misleading or simply wrong in their interpretation or use of Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, we recommend students not use Bibles containing study notes. Instead, find a Bible with only the Scripture verses themselves, so you won&#39;t be tempted to read the notes rather than the Bible itself.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you are using the New Living Translation (NLT) version of the Life Application Study Bible, you should probably select a different translation for your personal study. The NLT is not an accurate translation of the Bible (since it paraphrases Scripture), so using it for serious Bible study will make understanding the true meaning of Scripture difficult, at best.</p>\n\n<p>Again, we recommend a well-accepted literal translation like the KJV, NASB, NKJV, NIV, HSCB, ASV or similar Bibles.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. In Luke 12:45-46, Jesus tells a story of a man who says \"My Master is delaying his coming,\" and Jesus responds by saying He will \"appoint him a portion with the unbelievers.\" Can you clarify this? It sounds as if Jesus is saying that a believer can lose salvation.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>A. One could take this verse and misinterpret it to think that a person can lose their salvation. Fortunately, Scripture does not teach this, so we need to take a closer look at the passage to understand it properly.</p>\n\n<p>First, what do we know of the slave in the parable in vs. 45-46. Since the slave refers to Jesus as &ldquo;Master,\" it implies the slave is a believer, but in the parables (and in Scripture generally) we often see unbelievers pictured as slaves to God alongside believers. For example, God called all of Israel His servants (see Leviticus 25:55, Deuteronomy 32:36, 43), yet clearly, not all of Israel were believers (Hebrews 3:19). This simply shows how God rules over unbelieving people the same as believers, and He can use all men to His glory.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the case of Pharaoh, when God delivers the Israelites from Egypt. In Exodus 14:18, God says, &ldquo;Then the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD, when I am honored through Pharaoh, through his chariots and his horsemen.&rdquo; Romans 9:17 is similar, &ldquo;For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &ldquo;FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.&rdquo; Obviously, Pharaoh was not a believer.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to the context of this particular parable in Luke, Jesus had just finished severely rebuking the Pharisees and scribes. The Pharisees, who were the religious leaders of Israel, were in charge of God&rsquo;s servants at this time. Although they were in charge, they clearly were not giving the Israelites] \"their rations at the proper time,\" just as we read in the parable. Therefore, the Pharisees were not doing as their Master had commanded, and Jesus was rebuking the Pharisees through this parable. It&#39;s important to note that Scripture refers to all of Israel as God&rsquo;s servants, which would include the unbelieving Pharisees. Therefore, this is another example of unbelievers who were called God&rsquo;s servants.</p>\n\n<p>In the verses you mentioned, Jesus is specifically talking about the future event of His second coming. In that moment, He is referring to those who God will appoint as stewards over His servants. This refers to the apostles, in particular, but also to all church leaders and teacher who are commissioned to feed God&rsquo;s sheep. Just as Jesus told Peter three times to &ldquo;feed My sheep&rdquo; (John 21:15-17), pastors are told to feed God&rsquo;s sheep (1 Peter 5:2).</p>\n\n<p>Just as all of Israel are God&rsquo;s servants, likewise all men (and particularly all who seek to lead God&#39;s people) can be called God&rsquo;s servants, both believers and unbelievers. Those who are true believers will obey and will feed God&rsquo;s sheep, and they will be doing His will. Those who are false teachers will not obey, but instead they will mistreat the flock. Jesus warns us of these false teachers (e.g., Matthew 7:15-23, 2 Peter 2:1-3).</p>\n\n<p>Note that these false teachers know the Master&rsquo;s will, but, just like the Pharisees, because they are not true believers, they do not follow His will. As a result, they are assigned a place with the unbelievers. The main point here is that those slaves referred to in vs. 45 and 46 are not believers, and, therefore they are not \"losing their salvation\" as they were never saved.</p>\n\n<p>It may seem strange that there would be those who call themselves Christians, both pastors and laymen, who ultimately never accepted Christ themselves, but Scripture warns us that this will happen. In perhaps one of the most ominous passages of Scripture, Jesus tells us of those who thought they followed Him while on Earth will be shocked at the judgment to learn otherwise. He tells them, &ldquo;I never knew you.&rdquo; (Matthew 7:21-23) 1John 2 speaks of anti-Christs, and verse 19 says, &ldquo;They went out from us, but they were not really of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, so that it would be shown that they all are not of us.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Scripture gives us the assurance that these \"servants\" were no servants at all, as they were truly unbelievers. As a result, the passage in Luke 12 does not teach that true believers can lose salvation.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. If all men and women are born into a state of sinfulness, then what happens to infants when they die?&nbsp;</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. The question of how God accommodates the souls of children (or for that matter, the souls of invalids, mentally incapacitated, etc.) is not easy to answer, though Scripture does give us a limited answer. First, we must understand how all men are saved. Scripture tells us that all men are saved by faith in Jesus Christ, and by no other means. Without faith in the Savior&#39;s atoning sacrifice, no one may enter God&#39;s presence.</p>\n\n<p>But faith itself is not something that men arrive at by their own power and reason.</p>\n\n<p>Paul says in Romans 3 that no man chooses God - nor even seeks for God - by his own nature and will. On the contrary, the natural (unsaved) man is spirtually opposed to God and is an enemy of God (Rom 5:10). Paul later says in Romans 8:7 that the mind of natural man is hostile toward God and will not subject itself to God&#39;s decrees nor is even able to do so. Since man will never naturally seek after God nor believe the Gospel, Paul tells us in Ephesians 2:8 that our faith itself is \"a gift\" from God. Without God&#39;s intervention to change our hearts, all men would remain forever unbelievers until death.</p>\n\n<p>Taking all this together, we see that salvation is only possible when God grants an unbeliever a gift of faith, which leads the recipient to respond positively to the gospel and trust in Jesus. From the new believer&#39;s point of view, he remembers making a decision to believe the gospel and profess faith in Jesus, yet in reality his confession was itself proof that God had already been working in his heart to prompt this confession. Just as Jesus told Peter after Peter confessed that Jesus was Lord:</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. - Matt. 16:17</em></p>\n\n<p>This brings us back to the subject of infants.</p>\n\n<p>Saving faith does not come as the result of a human intellectual process, and therefore it is not dependent upon our mental capacity or any other human, fleshly ability. Otherwise, our salvation could be said to depend - at least in part - on our own effort (e.g., our effort of evaluating and understanding the gospel), but Paul says in Eph 2:8-9 that God grants salvation through the gift of faith so that no man may boast before God. Therefore, faith is a spiritual process initiated by God and entirely apart from the workings of men.</p>\n\n<p>As Paul says in Roman 9:</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.- Rom 9:16</em></p>\n\n<p>Obviously, believing adults will normally arrive at some level of understanding regarding their belief in Christ, but this process occurs only after the truth of the gospel has been placed in their hearts through the regenerative power of the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Consider these words of Paul:</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. - 1Cor. 1:18</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus&rsquo; sake. For God, who said, &ldquo;Light shall shine out of darkness,&rdquo; is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. - 2Cor. 4:3-6</em></p>\n\n<p>Paul teaches that the Gospel is not received by those who are \"perishing,\" but the One who shines the Light of the knowledge of Christ in our hearts is God Himself. So, faith is something that arrives by God&#39;s power and appointment in order to bring salvation to the unsavable, including you and I.</p>\n\n<p>This means that God may, if He chooses, grant the gift of faith to anyone at any age, since God doesn&#39;t depend on our intellect or understanding. God may bring faith into the heart of an infant (or even in the womb, as He did for John the Baptist), though parents won&#39;t detect the faith of a child until some time later, when the child gains the capacity to express themselves, leading to a public profession in Christ and baptism.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if that child dies as an infant, we might never know that God had saved the child. Nevertheless, the child would still be saved by faith even though the child never obtained the physical and intellectual ability to express faith publicly. In a glorified body, that child would still have an opportunity to praise and glorify God in eternity.</p>\n\n<p>This is the source of our present mystery. We can&#39;t know if God saves all children in this way or merely some children - either choice is within God&#39;s rights as sovereign Lord (see Rom 9:14-18).</p>\n\n<p>We may choose to believe that God grants the gift of faith to some infants but not to all, in the same way He saves some adults but not all. On the other hand, we could choose to believe that God will save all children who die in infancy (or before a certain age). In either case, we know that God saves children in the same way He saves all men: not for their inherent goodness nor lack of sinfulness (for there is no person of any age who lacks sin), but rather all must be saved through the gift of faith.</p>\n\n<p>Since scripture never tells us whether God saves some children or all children, we must trust this detail is unnecessary for a successful walk as Christians. Instead, we can know that God will do what is good and holy, and we look forward to a Day when we will understand it all perfectly (1Cor 13:12).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

Some say He descended into Hell, but that can&#39;t be.&nbsp; He went into the Lake of Fire, right?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Regarding the death of Christ, scripture teaches that Jesus visited Hell and preached to the spirits now in prison (1Pet 3:19). Upon His resurrection, Jesus&nbsp;led free captives after his crucifixion (Eph 4:8-10).</p>\n\n<p>To understand these verses, we must first understand the nature of the place called \"hell\" according to scripture. According to Luke 16, the holding place of the dead prior to Christ&#39;s death and resurrection was called Sheol. Sheol is the Old Testament name for the place all human spirits (or souls) were kept after the death of the body.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sheol consists of two parts or halves. On one side of Sheol is a place of comfort, while the other side of Sheol is a place of torment. The side of comfort is reserved for the saints (i.e., those saved by faith),&nbsp;while the side of torment holds the souls of all unbelievers.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible calls the side of bliss \"Abraham&#39;s Bosom,\" a euphemism reflecting the Bible&#39;s teaching that Abraham is the father of all who believe (Rom 4:11). Meanwhile, the side of torment is called Hades (or Ghenna in Hebrew), from which we get the English word hell.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to Christ&#39;s death, all departed souls existed in Sheol, either in Abraham&#39;s Bosom or in Hades. Such an arrangement was made necessary&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As you say, Hell is not the Lake of Fire. It is a place the Old Testament calls Sheol. There are many references to this place in the Old Testaments, including Num 16:33, 1Sam 2:6. This place is described in greater detail by Jesus in Luke 16 in the story of Lazarus and the rich man.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For a complete teaching on this lesson, please listen to Lesson 16B of our <a href=\"/bible-studies/the_book_of_luke\">Gospel of Luke</a> study.

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. What did the Bible mean when it says in John 12 that the Father has glorified His name and will glorify it again?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. We should begin by reading the entire passage in which your verse appears:</p>\n\n<h6>John 12:20 Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast;<br />\nJohn 12:21 these then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and began to ask him, saying, &ldquo;Sir, we wish to see Jesus.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 12:22 Philip came and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.<br />\nJohn 12:23 And Jesus answered them, saying, &ldquo;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.<br />\nJohn 12:24 &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.<br />\nJohn 12:25 &ldquo; He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal.<br />\nJohn 12:26 &ldquo;If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.<br />\nJohn 12:27 &ldquo;Now My soul has become troubled; and what shall I say, &lsquo;Father, save Me from this hour&rsquo;? But for this purpose I came to this hour.<br />\nJohn 12:28 &ldquo;Father, glorify Your name.&rdquo; Then a voice came out of heaven: &ldquo;I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 12:29 So the crowd of people who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered; others were saying, &ldquo;An angel has spoken to Him.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 12:30 Jesus answered and said, &ldquo; This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sakes.<br />\nJohn 12:31 &ldquo; Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.<br />\nJohn 12:32 &ldquo;And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 12:33 But He was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die.<br />\nJohn 12:34 The crowd then answered Him, &ldquo;We have heard out of the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how can You say, &lsquo;The Son of Man must be lifted up&rsquo;? Who is this Son of Man?&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 12:35 So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;For a little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>It is helpful to remember that Jesus&#39; mission was not to draw attention to Himself but to glorify His heavenly Father. John 4:34 declares that Jesus came to \"do the will of Him who sent me and to finish His work.\" And again in John 5:19, \"I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by Himself, He can do only what He sees His father doing.\"</p>\n\n<p>Through His life, Jesus glorified His Heavenly Father by living obediently to the Father&#39;s will. In this passage, Jesus first explains that He must go to death (v. 24) to bear the fruit of His ministry. He does so because this is the request of His Father, and He will obey His Father (v. 27).</p>\n\n<p>After Jesus declares to the Father glorify Your name, the Father responded that He has glorified His name, meaning the name of the Father has been glorified in the obedient life of Jesus, and the Father says He will glorify it again in the death of Jesus. In fact, the ultimate evidence of obedience in Jesus&#39; life was His obedience to go to the death willingly, even to the point of death on a cross (Philipians 2:8-10)</p>\n\n<p>So Jesus glorified the Father&#39;s name in His obedient life, and He was about to glorify God&#39;s name again in His obedient death.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

In Luke 7 it says that John the Baptist asked if Jesus was the One they were waiting for, but back in Chapter 3 when John baptizes Jesus, it says that the heavens opened, the Holy Spirit descended like a dove and the Father spoke. Wouldn&#39;t John have seen and heard this and therefore known who Jesus was?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. In Jewish teaching of Jesus&#39; day, there came to be a misconception concerning the Messiah. Jewish teachers taught that there must be two Messiahs since the prophecies concerning the Messiah seemed to split into two different types.</p>\n\n<p>First, there were prophecies that foretold a&nbsp;suffering, dying Prophet who would be led to the slaughter for the sake of Israel. Secondly, there were other prophecies that foretold&nbsp;a conquering Christ who would rule the world in glory. Since the teachers of Israel&nbsp;couldn&#39;t reconcile these two (seemingly) contradictory prophecies, they solved the dilemma by teaching there would be two Messiahs: a Prophet&nbsp;who would come to die for the sins of Israel and a Christ who would come to conquer Israel&rsquo;s enemies and rule over the world in peace.</p>\n\n<p>We can see this teaching reflected in a passage from John:</p>\n\n<h5>John 1:19 &nbsp;This is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 1:20 And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, &ldquo;I am not the Christ.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 1:21 They asked him, &ldquo;What then? Are you Elijah?&rdquo; And he&nbsp; said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you the Prophet?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;<br />\nJohn 1:22 Then they said to him, &ldquo;Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?&rdquo;</h5>\n\n<p>Notice the priests asked John the Baptist if he was one of three people: Elijah, the Prophet or the Christ? Their questions reflect the teaching of their day concerning the Messiah. Apparently, John the Baptist shared this same expectation, which explains his actions in Luke 7.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, John the Baptist likely sent his disciples to question Jesus because of his confusion over the Jewish teaching of two Messiahs. John knew Jesus to be the Messiah, the Lamb of God as he declared in John 1 and witnessed in Luke 3, but he probably assumed Jesus was only the suffering Prophet (i.e., a \"lamb\" led to slaughter). Therefore, John the Baptist also expected a second Messiah to eventually come.</p>\n\n<p>Then at some point, John the Baptist began to understand that Jesus was both the Prophet and the Christ. Therefore,&nbsp;John&#39;s question in Luke 7 was an inquiry as to whether Jesus was also the conquering Christ that John was still expecting. Jesus&#39; response to John&rsquo;s question made reference to miracles found in prophecies of Isaiah that were associated with the conquering Christ, so it appears Jesus was answering John&#39;s question in the affirmative by pointing to these miracles as proof that He was the expected Christ.</p>\n\n<p>So, John the Baptist did know that Jesus was the Son of God but he was confused by wrong teaching to think a second Messiah would follow Jesus. Once he realized that there would be only one Messiah, he asked Jesus to confirm His identity as the Expected One, the Christ.&nbsp;</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. I now believe that evolution is false, especially since death could not exist before Adam&rsquo;s sin, but what does that say about dinosaurs? Man couldn&rsquo;t possibly have survived with dinosaurs around, so how do they fit into the Biblical record? &nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Your belief that death could not exist prior to sin entering the world is absolutely true and critically important to understanding Genesis and the rest of the Bible, but your assumptions regarding dinosaurs have probably been influenced more by the opinions of modern science and Hollywood directors rather than the Bible.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/dinosaurs.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 319px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px 10px; float: right;\" /></p>\n\n<p>First, consider what we mean by the term \"dinosaur.&rdquo; The word itself means terrible lizard, as most people know, but that doesn&#39;t get to the real issue. The term dinosaur was a title coined by scientists to describe fossilized remains of certain prehistoric, extinct animals. For example, we generally don&#39;t use that term to describe the fossilized remains of extinct monkeys or insects, etc. Nor is the word used to describe more recently extinct animals like the dodo bird or carrier pigeon. Why? What&rsquo;s so special about a dinosaur fossil?</p>\n\n<p>In reality the title of dinosaur is granted somewhat arbitrarily (and rather sensationally) to describe only certain extinct animals found in the fossil record. Scientifically and biblically speaking, a dinosaur is no more significant than any other fossilized remains of dead, extinct animals.</p>\n\n<p>Many animals have become extinct over the course of the earth&rsquo;s history, and the overwhelming majority haven&#39;t receive special attention nor is their existence considered a threat to our confidence in the Bible. We understand that speciesroutinely die out, including the many animals that went extinct immediatley after the flood of Noah. Finding the remains of an extinct, fossilized animal poses no threat to the Biblical record.</p>\n\n<p>So, why do people give so much attention and interest to just one group of extinct animals, the so-called dinosaurs?&nbsp;Stop for a moment and consider&nbsp;<em><strong>why</strong></em>&nbsp;you believe dinosaurs are so important scientifically or so incompatible to humans. &nbsp;The answer is that Hollywood and modern science have biased us to think differently about this small group of animals in keeping with their respective agendas.</p>\n\n<p>First, you likely believe the few animals commonly called \"dinosaurs\" were important because scientistis maintain they lived millions of years ago, before mankind existed, and therefore they are mysterious and important to our past.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hollywood builds on this myth by featuring the animals in blockbuster movies as terrifying, strange and fascinating.</p>\n\n<p>After all, why do we suppose these animals were so much more fierce than others we know today?&nbsp;Is it because of their size or fierce teeth? Did you know that although a few dinosaurs were very large, the vast majority of dinosaurs weren&#39;t large at all. In fact, the average size of all dinosaurs was about the size of a chicken. And even the largest dinosaurs are similar in size to the largest land animals of today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, today&#39;s male giraffe is taller than all but a handful of the dinosaurs that ever lived, and the wooly mammoth was twice the size of the modern elephant. The blue whale is still the largest creature to have ever lived on earth, to say nothing of bears, lions, rhinos, and other large, dangerous animals. In fact, humans have always lived in the company of large, potentially dangerous creatures. Living with predators is nothing new for mankind, but the deception of evolution combined with Hollywood&rsquo;s vivid imagination have led us to assume otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible teaches that God created all land animals on the same day and that man had dominion over them all (Gen 1). Therefore, before the Fall there were no predator-prey relationships. All creatures were plant-eaters. Men didn&#39;t eat animals, animals didn&rsquo;t eat men, and animals didn&rsquo;t eat one another, because there was no death prior to the Fall (Rom 5:12).</p>\n\n<p>After Adam lost dominion, God still intended that man and animals subsist on plants alone (since God had not yet changed His instructions given in the garden). In the centuries that followed Adam&#39;s Fall, it&#39;s reasonable to assume that sinful men began disobeying God&#39;s instructions and started to kill animals for food (Gen 6:5). This would have placed the animal kingdom at great risk, since animals had no natural defense to man as yet.</p>\n\n<p>The lack of a predator-pray relationship among animals would have also allowed men to coexist with wild creatures - including dinosaurs - without concern. Ironically, pre-flood ancient man lived around dinosaurs more safely in their day than we coexist around our present day predators. This also explains why so many animals could cohabit for so long on the Ark without becoming food for one another. Finally, this mirrors what the Bible tells us about how the animal kingdom will behave once the curse on the earth is remove: the lion will lie down with the lamb in the new kingdom (Isaiah 11).</p>\n\n<p>After the Flood, things changed. First, God gave men the the right to eat animals (Gen 9:3), and secondly, He placed the fear of men in the animals (Gen 9:2). This established a predator-prey relationship between men and animals: men could hunt and kill animals without sin and the animals received a natural defense to men: fear.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

The clear, unmistakable and continual teaching of scripture from Genesis to Revelation is this: it is impossible for a saint to ever return to the unregenerate state he existed in prior to faith. In other words, it is impossible to lose your salvation. Once you believe, you become an adopted child of God, never to be sent away again (Eph 1:5; Gal 4:5). You were sealed forever by the Holy Spirit (Eph 4:30).</p>\n\n<p>You were not saved by your actions nor thoughts, but by His will and grace (Eph 2:8). Therefore, if you did nothing to obtain your salvation, you can do nothing to lose it. It was never under your control. It is a gift.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, you cannot lose your salvation nor even \"turn it in\" because of what God did in your heart and spirit at the moment of salvation. He performed a permanent work in your spirit by putting the old spirit to death and bringing you a new spirit, so that you are now a new creature (2Cor 5:17). The old self is gone forever never to return. You can no more return to your old state than a butterfly can return to the cocoon and become a caterpillar again. It&#39;s not a matter of our will or desire or even our obedience. To return is simply spiritually impossible. Praise the Lord!</p>\n\n<p>Regarding David&#39;s comment in Psalm 51, this is a significant psalm for several reasons. I&#39;ve included a copy of the Psalm below in a modern English translation:</p>\n\n<h6>51:1 Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness; according to the greatness of Your compassion blot out my transgressions.<br />\n51:2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity And cleanse me from my sin.<br />\n51:3 For I know my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me.<br />\n51:4 Against You, You only, I have sinned And done what is evil in Your sight,<br />\nSo that You are justified when You speak And blameless when You judge.<br />\n51:5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me.<br />\n51:6 Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, And in the hidden part You will make me know wisdom.<br />\n51:7 Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br />\n51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness, Let the bones which You have broken rejoice.<br />\n51:9 Hide Your face from my sins And blot out all my iniquities.<br />\n51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me.<br />\n51:11 Do not cast me away from Your presence And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.<br />\n51:12 Restore to me the joy of Your salvation And sustain me with a willing spirit.<br />\n51:13 Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, And sinners will be converted to You.<br />\n51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation; Then my tongue will joyfully sing of Your righteousness.<br />\n51:15 O Lord, open my lips, That my mouth may declare Your praise.<br />\n51:16 For You do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it; You are not pleased with burnt offering.<br />\n51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.<br />\n51:18 By Your favor do good to Zion; Build the walls of Jerusalem.<br />\n51:19 Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, In burnt offering and whole burnt offering;<br />\nThen young bulls will be offered on Your altar.<br />\n&nbsp;</h6>\n\n<p>This psalm describes the nature of the salvation process. The psalm begins with David acknowledging his sin before God (vs. 1-5). These verses describe the repentance step of salvation, including the fact that all men are born sinful (v. 5).</p>\n\n<p>Then David moves next to describing spiritual regeneration (vs. 6-10), the time when God changes our hearts and brings us the gift of faith (see also Eph 2:8-9). This is the part of the salvation process where our old nature (i.e., our old spirit) is put to death and we are made a new creature in Christ (v. 10).</p>\n\n<p>Pay close attention to the language of verse 6 in particular, where David describes how God plants wisdom (i.e., brings the knowledge of salvation through the Lord) in a \"hidden\" part of himself. His sins were blotted out (v. 9), which means they simply don&#39;t exist anymore. There is no condemnation possible for a Christian, because the entire penalty for our sins has already been paid by Christ. God can&#39;t punish us for sin, because that punishment has already been given to Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Then in vs. 11-15 David expresses the hope of his salvation. David is not wondering if God will do these things; rather, he is acknowledging that these things <strong><em>will be</em></strong> the consequence of God granting him salvation. Look at the full list:</p>\n\n<p>v.11 - the believer is never to be cast away<br />\nv.12 - the believer has joy in his salvation and is sustained by God&#39;s will<br />\nv.13 - the believer then teaches others and converts unbelievers<br />\nv.14 - the believer is free from the guilt of sin and praises God&#39;s righteousness<br />\nv.15 - the believer praises God</p>\n\n<p>These are the consequences for a believer who has obtained&nbsp;salvation. As a new creature in Christ, we have these new&nbsp;behaviors to accompany our new nature. (Please see 1John 2 for a good teaching on this principle.)</p>\n\n<p>Given all David wrote, the&nbsp;only way to interpret&nbsp;v. 11 to mean that a believer can lose salvation is to read that point of view into the text, since the author himself didn&#39;t have that thought on his mind when he wrote those verses. In fact, the author&#39;s point was completely the opposite - David was declaring the good things that come with salvation.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. You recently taught that the Holy Spirit was not given to men until Pentecost, but I know of several earlier times in scripture where the Holy Spirit was given to specific individuals (e.g., John the Baptist, Mary, etc.). Is there some different meaning or essence to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s ministry prior to Pentecost as compared to after?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. Yes. There are differences in the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s ministry to men and the manner of His operation before and after Pentecost. Prior to Pentecost the Holy Spirit is shown in scripture to come &ldquo;to&rdquo; men or to come &ldquo;upon&rdquo; men.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Saul experienced the Spirit of the Lord coming upon him just before he entered into battle (1Sam 10:6). Later after Saul had disobeyed God and disqualified himself to hold the throne of Israel, the Spirit departed from Saul (1Sam 16:14). This pattern is repeated in other places in the Old Testament. The Spirit of the Lord will come upon men for a period of time, and at some later point the Spirit will depart when His purpose has been met.</p>\n\n<p>After Pentecost, the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s ministry to men changed for the believer. In this age the Holy Spirit is charged with selecting a Bride for Christ and protecting Her until the Groom arrives at the rapture to claim Her. [This process is pictured in the story of Isaac and Rebecca, where Isaac pictures Christ, Rebecca pictures the Church, Abraham pictures the Father, and Abraham&rsquo;s unnamed servant pictures the Holy Spirit (see Gen 24).]</p>\n\n<p>Today the Holy Spirit unites with the spirit of each believer as a seal and down payment of the believer&rsquo;s future inheritance (see 2Cor 1:21-22). So once the Spirit indwells a believer, the association is permanent.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s manner of operation changed after Pentecost. Prior to Pentecost, the Spirit would empower (i.e., anoint) men to perform a certain mission or task as commanded by God. Today the Holy Spirit works to change the heart of the believer, to convict of sin and purify by the sword, the word of God.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the post-Pentecost ministry of the Spirit includes a fulfillment of Jesus&rsquo; promise to send the Helper or Teacher, the One Who will bring to mind Jesus&rsquo; teachings (John 14:26). This is a unique New Testament role for the Holy Spirit: to explain Jesus&rsquo; teachings. These N.T. roles give the Holy Spirit a unique operation and purpose during the Church age.</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong><em>Q. I have heard that The DaVinci Code is entertaining fiction. I&#39;d be interested in your thoughts on this.&nbsp;</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. I have a confession to make: I enjoyed reading The DaVinci Code. I found the book to be an intriguing mystery novel, and I have even recommended it to several friends. Obviously, it is a work of fiction, and any Christian who studies his or her Bible should easily recognize and disregard the countless myths and false assertions the author weaved into the backdrop of his novel. The novel&rsquo;s characters react to the myths as if they were literal truth, but any sensible Christian should be capable of enjoying the book as a work of fiction without suffering harm to their faith.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/code.jpg\" style=\"width: 260px; height: 379px; float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Having said that, I should also point out that the book is written in a very clever style that could easily lead unbelievers to mistake the fictional story line for fact. I&rsquo;m less concerned about the movie, since the inherent differences between books and movies mean audiences are less likely to confuse a Hollywood plot line for a documentary on history. Nevertheless, the movie has added to the hype surrounding the book, thereby increasing the public&#39;s interest in the author&rsquo;s false claims about Christ&rsquo;s life.</p>\n\n<p>We should be careful, therefore, when recommending the book to unbelievers. At the very least, we should not recommend the book without also looking for some opportunity to engage the person in a meaningful conversation about the life and purpose of the true Jesus. In that way, the book could actually become an effective witnessing tool to help drive a conversation about the truth of our faith and the Gospel message.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the book or movie may offer us our only opportunity to conduct such a conversation with an unbeliever who might not otherwise entertain such a discussion. I&#39;ve even toyed with the thought that the novel (in combination with the Bible, of course) could be made the focus of a useful Sunday School class in teaching young Christians how to defend the tenets of our faith and how to witness to those prone to believing the nonsense contained in the book.</p>\n\n<p>As I ponder your question, two scripture verses come to mind. First, Romans 14:19 instructs us to, &ldquo;pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.&rdquo; Paul is reminding Christians that every time we make a decision to act in our personal life, we should make a choice that offers the opportunity to encourage strong fellowship with other believers and which will build up others in their faith.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, Philippians 1:10 teaches, &ldquo;approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ.&rdquo; Much like the first verse, this verse reminds us to give our support and approval only to those things that are &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; &ndash; in other words, spiritually helpful and pleasing to God. As I consider these two verses, I find it harder to recommend The DaVinci Code as a casual read. So perhaps its only real value is as a tool for use in ministry (in the way I described earlier).</p>\n\n<p>As with all issues like this one, ultimately each believer should follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in deciding what&rsquo;s best for him and his walk with the Lord. If you seek His will, He will direct your steps.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>"

How do you answer the person who would say that this is a contradiction in the scriptures?&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. In the John passage you quoted, the Pharisees declared that no prophet had arisen from the Galilee, and as you say Jonah was from the Galilee. For that matter, Nahum was also from the Galilee, since he was from the tribe of Simeon, which settled in the Galilee, and some scholars believe Micah may have been a Galilean as well. So clearly, the Pharisees were wrong about prophets not originating in the Galilee. Prophets do, in fact, arise from the Galilee.</p>\n\n<p>When the Pharisees mistakenly claimed (or more likely intentionally lied) by stating that no prophet arises from the Galilee, they were attempting to discredit Jesus. They were playing to a widely held bias against Galileans in their day. In fact, the common name for the Galilee region was the \"Galilee of the Gentiles,\" since it was considered an area inhabited by people who were something \"less than Jew.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Pharisees were also wrong when they tried to associate Jesus with the Galilee in this way. Jesus was not from the Galilee. Jesus was from Bethlehem, the ancestral home of David and the tribe of Judah, therefore he was only a Galilean by association, not by birth. So, even if the Pharisees had been correct in saying that no prophet arises from the Galilee, Jesus could still defend Himself against their accusations since He was not born in that region.</p>\n\n<p>If the Pharisees had bothered to do their homework (or if they had honest intentions), they would have known Jesus was born in Bethlehem, which is exactly the place where the Messiah was predicted to be born in Deuteronomy 18:15.</p>\n\n<p>So, there is no contradiction in scripture. The Pharisees&#39; statements were simply not true.

You caught my attention in your Revelation study when you asked why God took &ldquo;so long&rdquo; to create the world, especially your comment, &ldquo;The God I worship could have created everything in an instant.\" I like that, but now I gotta know why He took so long!!&nbsp;</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. I chuckled when I read your comment regarding my Genesis study. I am pleased to hear my comment piqued your interest in that study, and you can hear the entire teaching in our <a href=\"/bible-studies/genesis_2011\">Genesis</a>&nbsp;Bible Study.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I can try to give you something of an answer now (at least briefly) by covering two points. First, God chose to complete creation in seven days (rather than in an instant), in part, as a means of pointing to Christ. This idea is explained in greater detail in Hebrews 4 and elsewhere in scripture, but essentially the seventh day of creation was used by God as a picture of Christ. God the Father gave us the Sabbath as a illustration of the relationship between grace and works, between our experience of trying hopelessly to \"work\" our own salvation (with no opportunity for rest from that effort) verses God doing the work on our behalf while we accept His work and rest in it (i.e., resting in Christ&rsquo;s work on the cross).</p>\n\n<p>Hebrews 4 calls Christ our Sabbath rest (and Jesus says in Luke 6 that He is Lord of the Sabbath). He did the work of our salvation, so now we rest in that work. The six days of creation illustrate that God did all the work and mankind simply receives the benefit of that work. Likewise, God (in Christ) did the work of salvation, and believers merely rest in that work, which is why we say every day is a Sabbath for Christians.<br />\nSecondly, God created the world and everything in it in six days rather than instantly so that His purpose in His creation could be understood by how it was formed. The world was created for man, and therefore all that was done was done in such a way that man could understand he was the intended beneficiary of God&#39;s creation and not merely a player within it.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when God made man on Day 6, the stage had already been set for man&#39;s entrance, including trees created already bearing fruit, a garden already prepared for man&rsquo;s home, etc. Also, creating the world in six successive days gave God the opportunity to pause and declare the creation to be good at various points along the way (e.g., Gen 1:31, et al.), which is how we know that the world was made perfectly, not becoming corrupt until man introduced sin and death.</p>\n\n<p>This is a very quick overview, of course, and I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have the teaching recorded. Genesis and Revelation are my two most requested courses, so I expect to teach Genesis again soon. When I do, I will record it and announce its availability on my website and to those on my mailing list. And I will certainly place it on iTunes!</p>"

                "body": "<p><strong>Q. Can you explain Calvinism?</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\nA. The term Calvinism refers to a system of teaching popularly associated with John Calvin, a renown theologian of the 16th Century. Calvin was one of the key leaders of the Protestant Reformation, and he wrote literally hundreds of volumes of Christian teaching over his lifetime. Even today, he is still considered one of the foremost thinkers of the Christian faith and arguably the most influential teacher within the Reformation movement.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Calvin\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/YoungerCalvin_001.jpg\" style=\"width: 275px; height: 327px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px 10px; float: left;\" />Among all his teachings, Calvin is most closely associated with a five-point set of beliefs that bear his name. The five points of Calvinism were actually distilled from the larger body of Christian teaching common to all Reformed movement leaders of that era (e.g., Luther, Zwingli, Bucer, Knox, etc.). Over the centuries, Calvinism&#39;s five points have become a covenient shorthand for summarizing the Reformers&#39; views concerning the Bible&#39;s teaching on the fallen nature of man and God&#39;s saving grace through faith.</p>\n\n<p>Though the five points are now commonly called Calvinism, ironically they were not actually authored by Calvin himself. In fact, Calvin never proposed a list of five points, nor did he ever teach from such a framework. In reality, the five points were already widely-held beliefs among most Protestants of the 16th Century, and only many years after his death did Calvin&#39;s name become closely identified with this teaching.</p>\n\n<p>Before we explain the five points and examine them in light of Scripture, we need to clarify that no Christian should ever profess a belief in the five points of Calvinism or any other man-made teaching. Rather, Christians are to embrace the Word of God above all else, and when we find the counsel and teaching of men to agree with Scripture, then we may commend that teaching to ourselves and others. Nevertheless, our trust lies solely in God&#39;s word.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, even if we agree with Calvin&#39;s teaching, we shouldn&#39;t profess to \"believe\" in Calvinism. Conversely, though we disagree with some of Calvin&#39;s teaching, that doesn&#39;t mean everything the man taught was wrong nor should we demonize the man. No man is perfect in his understanding of Scripture (1Cor 13:12), therefore we trust the Holy Spirit to teach us all things as we yield to Him and seek His counsel in the Word of God.</p>\n\n<p>Turning to the five points of Calvinism, let&#39;s examine each one in comparison with Scripture:</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nPoint 1 - Total Depravity</h3>\n\n<p>Calvin (and the other Reformers) viewed Scripture to teach that men are born with a depraved and fallen nature. As a result, men are forever opposed to God, never seek God, and therefore have no hope to find God by their own efforts. Reformers summarized this point by affirming the total depravity of man.</p>\n\n<p>On this point, the Reformers&#39; teaching is consistent with scripture. The Bible clearly teaches that men are depraved from birth (Rom 1-2), no man will ever seek God by his own nature (Rom 3), nor are men even able to do so (Rom 8). Fallen men are forever lost and without hope. No human appeal made to the flesh will ever persuade an unbeliever to obey God&#39;s word. Only when the Holy Spirit quickens a man&#39;s spirit and prompts him to receive the Gospel will true faith result (e.g., 1Cor 12:3).</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nPoint 2 - Unconditional Election</h3>\n\n<p>Secondly, the Reformers taught that God acts unconditionally and according to His own sovereign purposes in bringing a man into a state of faith. In this way, Calvinism says that God \"elects\" to bring men to faith, and His election does not depend on the work nor the will of the person being saved. Only God&#39;s grace (i.e., God&#39;s unmerited favor) is responsible for man&#39;s salvation through faith, since men are depraved and unable to act on their own behalf apart from God&#39;s grace.</p>\n\n<p>On this point, the Bible&#39;s teaching also reaffirms the Reformers&#39; views. The Bible teaches repeatedly that our faith is a gift (Eph 2:8-9) and that our coming to faith must be preceded by God&#39;s regenerative work in our heart to bring about repentence (John 6:44; 6:65; 1Cor 12:3; Phil 1:29; Acts 11:18; 13:48, etc.). Since man&#39;s depravity leaves him unable to seek God by his own will, then it&#39;s clear that God must choose to act first to bring men to faith, otherwise no man would ever be saved (see Rom 9:16)! God must elect us to faith for salvation to be possible.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nPoint 3 - Limited Atonement</h3>\n\n<p>Calvinism&#39;s third point teaches that Christ&#39;s atonement on the cross was \"limited,\" in the sense that God only intended to extend the saving work of Jesus to cover the sins of the elect. Reformers did not teach that the atoning work of Christ on the cross was insufficient to save all men, but rather Calvinism says it was only intended for those whom God chooses to elect through grace. While the work of Christ on the cross was indeed powerful enough to save all men from sin (had God determined to save all men), God only intended to apply Christ&#39;s sacrifice to the sins of those He foreknew and intended to grant mercy.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding this point of Calvinism, the Bible&#39;s position is less certain. First, some passages (like John 3:16) seem to suggest that the atonement was intended for all men. On the other hand, Jesus Himself declared in John 10 that He had certain lost sheep He would call, and they alone would hear His voice. This statement could lead us to conclude that the rest of humanity who were not His sheep (those not elected to salvation) are not expected nor intended to hear His voice, just as sheep will not respond to an unknown voice. This view seems consistent with John 6, where Jesus says that the Father has given Him certain sheep (i.e., the elect) and that those sheep Jesus has been given, He will not lose.</p>\n\n<p>Going a step further in this analysis, we know that both the events in John 6 and John 10 occured prior to the crucifixion, suggesting that the elect were already on God&#39;s mind even before He sent His Son to the cross. Could this mean that Jesus&#39; sacrifice was intended to cover only those He foreknew and intended to call into faith? This is the difficult concept Calvinism proposes from Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>Other passages to consider on this point are those that teach the wicked are storing up wrath for their day of judgment (i.e., Romans 2:5). These passgaes might support the view that Jesus&#39; atonement was limited in application. We know that as Jesus hung on the cross, He took upon Himself the Father&#39;s wrath for sin. Paul says unbelievers are storing up wrath for their day of judgment. If Jesus took the wrath intended for all men on the cross, wouldn&#39;t that mean that God&#39;s wrath would have already been exhausted come the day of judgment?</p>\n\n<p>Instead, perhaps God withheld that portion of His wrath reserved for unbelievers and only poured out the balance upon Jesus &ndash; that is, His wrath deserved by the elect? If God did withhold His wrath reserved for the unsaved, then we might say that the atonement of Christ was limited by design. Additional scriptural evidence that potentially supports this conclusion may be found in Rom 2:5, Rom 5:9, Rom 9:22, Eph 2:3, Eph 5:6, 1Thess 5:9, among others.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of these postulations, Cavinism&#39;s third point remains debatable and controversial. Furthermore, it is largely academic and without application in our daily practice as Christians. Therefore, many believe it is the weakest link in the five-point chain, leading some to reject this tenet of Calvinism, calling themselves \"four-point Calvinists.\"</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nPoint 4 - Irresistible Grace</h3>\n\n<p>Fourth, Calvinism teaches that as God extends grace to an unbeliever, His work through the Holy Spirit is assured to result in a spiritual transformation leading to salvation. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is a work that is, by its very nature, an expression of God&#39;s sovereign will, and as such it cannot be thwarted by our contrary nature. After all, all men are by nature enemies of God, and therefore we will always oppose the Gospel - until God causes us to believe.</p>\n\n<p>All believers, therefore, are merely the recipients of God&#39;s grace, and our profession of faith is both the evidence and testimony of our salvation (John 3:16-18).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding this third point, there is much agreement to be found in scripture, though there is also opportunity for confusion. Among the many scripture references supporting this teaching are Rom 9:15-18, Rom 9:10-12, 1Pet 2:9, James 1:18, 2Thess 2:13-14, and others. In these verses, the Bible affirms God&#39;s sovereignty over the salvation of men, to include that God, having purposed to save a man, will certainly carry it through (Eph 1:9).</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, there is debate and confusion concerning this point due to the many Bible passages that call upon unbelievers to repent and accept the Gospel. These passages suggest that since the Gospel is, by necessity, proclaimed to unbelievers, then the choice to respond - or reject - that call must lie with the unbeliever. Otherwise, why would God bother to extend an appeal in the first place if His grace will always bring about a positive response?</p>\n\n<p>The answer offered by proponents of Calvinism&#39;s fourth point is that the appeal of the Gospel spoken through evangelists is merely the method God uses to manifest His grace, but it is still His grace alone which prompts a positive response in the unbeliever.</p>\n\n<p>We can use two examples to illustrate this point. First, a mother looking for her lost child in the shopping mall will call out for the child. The mother&#39;s call for her child is heard by the entire mall crowd, but the mother only expects her child to hear her voice and respond. She has no expectation that others in the crowd will respond, though they heard the same call. Her method resulted in her call reaching many ears, but she only expected a response from her true child.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, the call of the gospel goes out to all the world, but only those who have \"ears to hear\" will receive it. In this way, God uses men to spread the message of His grace, but He only expects the message to be received by His lost children, and when they hear the call, they will respond (John 10:27-28).</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we can see a demonstration of this point in the story of the Exodus, when the Israelites crossed the Red Sea. God directed Moses to raise his staff, and in response to his obedience, God caused the Red Sea to part before the Israelites. Though God caused the Red Sea to part when Moses raised his staff, we can be sure that God was prepared to part the Red Sea with or without Moses&#39; cooperation. God&#39;s will would be done, and though he allowed Moses to join in that work, Moses was never in control of the outcome.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, God chooses to use human voices to spread the gospel, and He uses evangelists to persuade men to believe the Gospel, but we can be sure that it is only God&#39;s grace through His Spirit that is responsible for faith in the heart of a believer. Like in the day of Moses, God&#39;s eternal purpose to save men will be accomplished in the lives of His children.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nPoint 5 - Perseverance of the Saints</h3>\n\n<p>Finally, Calvinism says that all who are saved by God&#39;s grace are forever saved and can never fall from that grace. God&#39;s saving work results in a permanent relationship that can never be undone.</p>\n\n<p>On this final point, there is also obvious agreement with scripture. Our eternal security in Christ is a consequence of the nature of our regeneration in Christ and of our New Covenant relationship with God. When we are \"saved,\" our old nature is put to death by the power of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. We inherited that old nature at birth from Adam, but upon regeneration we receive Christ&#39;s nature in its place.</p>\n\n<p>From that point onward, it is not we who live, but Christ Who lives in us. Our old man is gone and can never return because it no longer exists. It has died with Christ. Scripture references include Rom 8:30, Rom 6:3-4, 2Cor 5:17, Gal 2:20, John 6:39-44, among many others.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, Calvinism&#39;s five points were born out of the Reformation teaching concerning man&#39;s fallen nature and God&#39;s grace. Many of the tenets of Calvinism are in keeping with the teaching of scripture, though some disagreement is possible.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of our views of Calvin&#39;s teaching, we should never declare a \"belief\" in Calvinism, nor would we encourage others to take such a position. Our faith is in Christ and our belief is in His word. All else is ultimately unimportant.</p>\n\n<p>For a more in-depth examination of these ideas, please read our article <a href=\"/devotionals/wrestling_with_god\">Wrestling With God</a>.</p>"

                "body": "<p><em><strong>Q. Paul says in 1Cor 14:34 that women should keep silent in church, and I was wondering if this verse is taken out of context. Did Paul mean that women can never speak in church?</strong></em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. That passage of Scripture is often taken out of context. Like most controversies in scripture, this one can be diffused simply by returning to the context - in this case, the context of 1Corinthians 14. In that chapter Paul is addressing the proper nature and order of worship in the Corinthian church. From the entire chapter, it&#39;s clear that this church&#39;s worship service had deteriorated into a wild free-for-all. Men and women were speaking over one another, vying for a chance to offer a &ldquo;word from the Lord,&rdquo; often speaking at the same time as others, some even pitching themselves into a physical frenzy to gain greater attention. Others were speaking in tongues yet without an interpreter present. The whole service must have resembled a mob scene or even an insane asylum (see v. 23).</p>\n\n<p>In chapter 14 Paul sets out to instruct the church in Corinth on how to conduct a proper, edifying worship service (see v. 12). Paul devotes the first half of the chapter to rebuking the Corinth church for focusing too much on the gift of tongues (a tendency still found in the modern-day Pentecostal movement), and as a result the church was misusing the gift during the service. After v. 25, Paul moves beyond the issue of speaking in tongues to talk more generally about the order of worship.</p>\n\n<p>In v. 26 Paul says that a plurality of gifts is required for the edification of the Body, and he provides several rules for how the various utterance gifts are to be used in the service. Paul&rsquo;s first requirement is that the act of speaking in tongues must be joined with the services of an interpreter. Secondly, the gift of teaching should be limited to only two or three teachers speaking during a service (Paul calls these teachers \"prophets\" in v. 29). Third, if God gives a teacher who is seated in the audience a revelation in the moment, then the teacher leading the service should yield the floor to the seated teacher (v. 30).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the &ldquo;spirits of prophecy&rdquo; are to remain subject to the prophets (vs.31-32). In other words, prophets (teachers) are to keep themselves under physical control while teaching. If the teacher loses control of his body while speaking (i.e., flies into a frenzy or foams at the mouth, etc.), then the spirit controlling the man is not to be considered from God (v. 33). Men under the influence of the Holy Spirit should remain calm and in control, but men under demonic influence often exhibit wild physical mannerisms, as is often described in the Gospels.</p>\n\n<p>Then Paul turns to the subject of women. In light of what Paul&rsquo;s been teaching to this point in the chapter (i.e., establishing order in the gathering), it&#39;s easy to understand why he instructs women to remain silent. Paul didn&rsquo;t issue a general prohibition against woman speaking at all, but rather it was a specific prohibition against interrupting or contending with the teaching done by men. Paul was instructing women not to interrupt the teaching in the service. Remember, the problem in this church was the complete absence of proper order in the worship service, so Paul is laying down ground rules to help re-establish order.</p>\n\n<p>Because men hold the authority in the church (under the headship of Christ), women may only teach (or contend with teaching) under a man&#39;s spiritual headship. When a man teaches in the service, a women should not interrupt the man nor challenge him in his teaching. If she has a question about the teaching, she should turn to her husband for the answer. If he can&rsquo;t answer her, then the husband has responsibility to raise the issue with the teacher on behalf of his family.</p>\n\n<p>We believe Paul&#39;s teaching still holds true for churches today, though the church rarely has reason to apply it since it&#39;s no longer customary for members of the congregation (whether men or women) to interrupt the speaker during a church service. If a church were to permit the congregation to question the teacher during the sermon, however, then we would expect the church to observe Paul&#39;s direction concerning women. Questions should only come from men, while women who have questions should ask the male head in her family (or another family) to bring the question forward.</p>\n\n<p>Please consult our complete teaching on this topic found in our <a href=\"/resource_library/bible_studies/first_corinthians/\"><strong>1Corinthians</strong></a> Bible study.

Clearly, this is a false assumption, as Jesus was deeply touched in seeing many of his friends languishing over the death of a loved one. It&#39;s likely also that He was moved by the consequences of man&#39;s sin, being death and suffering.</p>"

If this is true, then the Rapture can only happen at one time a year. Is this true or can the Rapture happen anytime?\"</em></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A. You ask an interesting question. To answer it, let me begin by giving some background on the Jewish practice of blowing trumpets during their festivals. The type of trumpet used in Rosh Hashanah is a ram&#39;s horn (a shofar) that is blown during the feast, but the horn can also be called a trumpet. In fact, Jews commonly called the event the Feast of the Trumpets for that reason.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Shofar - The trumpet of the last days\" src=\"https://www.versebyverseministry.org/images/uploads/horn.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 208px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px 10px; float: right;\" />During the feast, the trumpet is blown a total of 100 times, with the final horn blast lasting much longer than the first 99 blasts. This final blast pictures the trumpet sound which will announce the Rapture of the Church, which Paul mentions in 1Cor 15. By the way, the trumpet blast associated with the Rapture is not to be confused with the trumpet judgments of Tribulation. Rather, it is associated with the final horn of the Feast of Trumpets.</p>\n\n<p>The feast of Rosh Hashanah is a shadow or picture of the Rapture, but we error if we try to mix too many elements of the picture God has given us with the reality it represents. Specifically, all seven of the Jewish feasts were given to the nation of Israel to picture various aspects of God&#39;s redemptive plan. These pictures taught men about the reality of God&#39;s plan of redemption and illustrated many if its details, but this does not mean that the festivals perfectly reflect every detail of God&rsquo;s plan. Not every detail in the festivals find an obvious parallel in some historical reality.</p>\n\n<p>For example, one day each year Jews celebrate the Day of Atonement, which is also a picture of Tribulation. However, the actual Tribulation we know will last seven years when it comes, but the Day of Atonement is only a single day on the calendar. The picture points to the reality but it does not substitute for the reality.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, it would be a mistake to assume that Tribulation will last only a single day simply because the feast that pictures the event lasts just one day. Likewise, it would be wrong to assume that the Rapture must occur on the very same calendar day as the Feast of Trumpets simple because the feast pictures the reality of the Rapture. Having said that, it is certainly possible that the Rapture will occur on the same calendar day as the Feast of Trumpets, but it is no more likely than any other day of the calendar.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, in modern times the Jewish nation has taken to observing the Feast over a two day period rather than on a single day as originally given in the Bible. In centuries past, the Jews could not always be sure when one day ended and another began, since it was based on the visibility of three stars by eyewitnesses in Judea. Jews living outside Palestine were required to estimate when the day began in Israel and not based on where they lived (e.g., Babylonia or the Disaspora).</p>\n\n<p>In order to be sure that they did not observe the wrong day, the Jews made Rosh Hashanah a two-day festival, thus leaving room for error in determining the start date. Technically, in Judaism today it is known as Yom Arichtaor (the long day), because the two days are counted as one rather than as two singular days. Consequently, even if the day of Rosh Hashanah was the actual calendar day God has appointed for the Rapture, we still can&#39;t say for certain which specific day it will occur, since the feast is currently observed over two days.</p>"
