            "description": "Ephesians is the \"go-to\" book in the New Testament for an understanding of God&#39;s sovereignty in&nbsp;salvation by grace, and therefore it shares much in common with Paul&#39;s other masterwork: Romans.\r\n\r\nPaul wrote this letter while enduring his first Roman imprisonment in house arrest. As Roman guards stood watch, Paul penned a powerful letter&nbsp;to forestall an apostasy, a falling away, in a large church in a leading city of a powerful empire, a city renown for its wealth and fleshly indulgence.\r\n\r\nLife in Ephesus was similar to life in&nbsp;major Western cities today. Many of the same temptations to depart the faith are tugging at the hearts of 21st-century believers as they were for the 1st-century believers in Ephesus, which makes this letter imperative&nbsp;to understand now. Pastor Steve will dissect the letter&#39;s powerful theology and practical advice for the Christian family in his usual in-depth, verse-by-verse approach. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nNew lessons are&nbsp;posted most weeks.

            "description": "There&#39;s an old joke about a country farmer who gave a pessimistic reply to a lost driver from the city seeking directions home...the&nbsp;farmer replied, \"You can&#39;t get there from here.\"\r\n\r\nLikewise, if you try&nbsp;to understand prophecy without studying the book of Daniel, well, you can&#39;t there from here. The prophecies found in the book of Daniel are the key to unlocking all biblical prophecy. The prophet Daniel explained the past and the future of Israel and all Gentile nations according to the plan and purposes of God and his revelations do so with such incredible accuracy that he has silenced many a biblical skeptic throughout history. &nbsp;\r\n\r\nPastor Steve often cites Daniel to explain biblical prophecy elsewhere in scripture (especially in his Revelation study), and now, finally, we are pleased to present the definitive VBVMI study on this essential book of scripture.",

            "description": "The Book of Ruth is classically described as a love story or a story of redemption. Though these descriptions are not wrong, they are incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe story of Ruth is a story of woman in need of grace and a man who is willing to extend it. It is also a footnote to the story of Judges and the times when Israel did what was right in its own eyes. Finally, the book of Ruth is properly understood to be a book of eschatology &ndash; a prophetic picture of God&#39;s plan for Israel and the Church. The literal events of the story foreshadow and explain God&#39;s redemption of a disobedient Israel and the opportunity for the Gentile world to share in Israel&#39;s promises.\r\n\r\nThis course is an updated, all-new presentation of our earlier study of Ruth. Pastor Armstrong teaches both the redemption storyline and the end times story line side by side through the entire book. Join us for an entirely unique and insightful explanation of this precious book of scripture.",

            "description": "After centuries of God ruling His people through judges, Israel demanded a king like other nations, thereby rejecting the Lord. So the Lord directed the prophet Samuel to appoint a king, Saul, who ruled according to his flesh even as the Lord was preparing another man, David, after His own heart.\r\n\r\nLearn how Israel moved to become a nation under a king and how the Lord used Israel&#39;s impatience to demonstrate the inadequacy of human rulers in solving the problem of the nation&#39;s sin and apostasy. In addition to telling the story of Saul and David, the book of 1Samuel introduces other well-known biblical characters in scripture including Jonathan, Mephibosheth and others.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPastor Armstrong teaches this year-long study through 1 Samuel in his notable in-depth, insightful style.

            "description": "Our authoritative, completely-revised 34-lesson study of end times in the book of Revelation is here!&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany Christians consider Revelation to be a mysterious and even frightening book of scripture. Some avoid studying it, and among those who do try, many find it confusing. Why does the book confound so many and give rise to so many conflicting interpretations? The answer: because it&#39;s the final book&nbsp;of the Bible.\r\n\r\nThe Bible with its 66 books can be compared to a novel having 66 chapters. Like a novel, the storyline builds from front to back, with the characters, themes and plot elements introduced early and developed across many chapters. Obviously, the Bible doesn&#39;t read like most novels, but it was intended to be understood as a single work, and it did have a single Author.\r\n\r\nNow consider what would happen if you selected a novel from the shelves of your local bookstore and decided to read only the final chapter. How much of that final chapter would you understand?&nbsp; Most likely, you would be thoroughly confused. Naturally, only after reading the entire book would the final chapter make any sense.\r\n\r\nLikewise, we could see Revelation as the final chapter in God&#39;s 66-chapter novel called the Bible. In the same way we must read a novel cover to cover before understanding it properly, so must Bible students have an understanding of the Bible&#39;s first 65 books before they can truly understand the final book of Revelation.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, a verse-by-verse teaching of Revelation would be a challenging endeavor. How do you teach the last chapter in a novel when you can&#39;t be sure your audience has studied the first 65 books? The answer is simple: you teach them the entire Bible!\r\n\r\nConsequently, our Revelation study examines not only the 22 chapters of John&#39;s vision, it also covers relevant sections of Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Leviticus, Ruth, Kings and Chronicles, Job, the Psalms, Daniel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, all the minor prophets, the Gospels and the Epistles. Virtually every book of the Bible is consulted during our 34-hour course, leading many VBVM students to say that our Revelation study is an attempt to teach the entire Bible in a single class. We know no other way to do it!\r\n\r\nSimply put, there is&nbsp;no better study of end times than the VBVM International study of Revelation.\r\n\r\nOur book of Revelation Bible study comes complete with MP3 audio teaching, complete PDF study notes (over 200,000 words!), and full color visual aids for projection or black and white visual aids for printing. Use all the materials to study for yourself or to teach the class to others.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can experience this same content complete with the visual aids as videos. More videos will be added each week until the entire study is available (expected to be complete by the end of 2015).",

John approached his Gospel with an intent to illustrate the&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;of Jesus&#39; ministry on earth rather than strictly relating&nbsp;the events of His life.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEach chapter is&nbsp;a window into Jesus&#39; earthly ministry illustrating how the Lord fulfilled&nbsp;various spiritual pictures of the Messiah found in&nbsp;Old Testament texts, including the spiritual messages of Creation,&nbsp;birth, water, bread, sight, Sabbath&nbsp;and more. Not only do we learn about our Lord&#39;s life on earth, but we also discover new spiritual importance in familiar Old Testament stories.\r\n\r\nPastor Armstrong teaches verse-by-verse through&nbsp;John&#39;s Gospel in his notable in-depth, insightful style.

            "description": "Everything we believe about the life, teachings and significance of Jesus of Nazareth hinges on our view of the Resurrection accounts. The Resurrection account in the Gospels is the most compelling evidence for the deity of Jesus. This teaching offers a survey of the evidence presented in support of the eyewitness accounts. This lesson was presented on Easter 2009 at Oak Hill Bible Church in Austin, Texas.",

            "description": "Many of Jesus&#39; most profound teachings were presented in riddles called parables. The meaning of His teaching was cloaked because (as Jesus Himself stated) only certain people were intended to understand the meaning. By the revelation of the Holy Spirit, believers are able to understand the meaning of His parables, and this series explores several of Jesus&#39; more famous parables for \"those who have ears to hear.\"\r\n\r\nThe notes for this series can be found as part of our Luke study.",

This is the Great Exchange, whereby Christ went to the grave in our place while we receive by faith the credit for His righteous life. The Bible calls this propitiation, and on Easter 2012 Pastor Armstrong explained how propitiations works and how Jesus took our place in death yet He didn&#39;t need to spend eternity in Hell to save us from that penalty.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTaught at Oak Hill Bible Church in Austin, Texas, on Easter 2012.",
