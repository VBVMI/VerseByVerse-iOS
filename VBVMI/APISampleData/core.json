                "description": "<p>Paul&#39;s letter to the Romans is widely acknowledged to be the single most important theological essay ever written. Romans is literally loaded with essential Christian doctrine, and no Bible education is complete without a thorough examination of this book. Martin Luther commanded every Christian to memorize Romans word-for-word, and though we may never reach Luther&#39;s goal, we can certainly give ourselves to understanding the letter&#39;s wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>The Book of Romans reads like a course in systematic Christian theology, and it holds the keys to understanding a long list of fundamental Christian doctrines and beliefs, including soteriology (the doctrine of salvation), harmartiology (the doctrine of sin), Israelology (the doctrine of Israel), election, predestination, sanctification, and many other important truths.</p>\n\n<p>This is an all-new study of Romans which replaces our prior Romans study, and new lessons are posted weekly (usually on Thursdays).&nbsp;To attend this study live each week, please visit our&nbsp;<strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><a href=\"/events/romans2017\">Romans 2017 Bible study</a>&nbsp;</strong>event page<strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">.</strong></p>",

Ezekiel&nbsp;witnessed marvelous things in his prophetic visions even as he lived through terrible things on earth.</p>\n\n<p>Along with Ezekiel&#39;s&nbsp;declaration of&nbsp;judgment to Israel came a message of hope in a future restoration, though the message was veiled&nbsp;by&nbsp;mysterious symbols and events&nbsp;that still generate wonder and debate today. Pastor Steve will&nbsp;move through the book in a methodical fashion to&nbsp;unveil the Lord&#39;s message to Israel and all believers.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Important Note</strong></u>: &nbsp;This study was temporarily&nbsp;suspended after chapter 15 as Pastor Armstrong transitions from his position at Oak Hill Bible Church to his new position as pastor of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vbvf.org\" target=\"_blank\">Verse By Verse Fellowship</a>.

As Roman guards stood watch, Paul penned a powerful letter&nbsp;to forestall an apostasy, a falling away, in a large church in a leading city of a powerful empire, a city renown for its wealth and fleshly indulgence.</p>\n\n<p>Life in Ephesus was similar to life in&nbsp;major Western cities today. Many of the same temptations to depart the faith are tugging at the hearts of 21st-century believers as they were for the 1st-century believers in Ephesus, which makes this letter imperative&nbsp;to understand now. Pastor Steve will dissect the letter&#39;s powerful theology and practical advice for the Christian family in his usual in-depth, verse-by-verse approach. &nbsp;</p>",

                "description": "<p>Paul&#39;s ministry to the Gentiles took him throughout the known world, and along the way he collected men who desired to minister with him. One of those men was a young teacher and pastor named Timothy who stayed behind in Ephesus after Paul moved on. Later Paul wrote two letters to this young pastor encouraging him in the face of dissension and false teachers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Despite assaults from various critics over the centuries,&nbsp;Paul&#39;s advice to Timothy has stood the test of time proving itself to be an&nbsp;indispensable manual both for church leaders and congregations. Paul&#39;s words can be difficult at times, because his teaching&nbsp;exposes our&nbsp;pride, rebellion&nbsp;and selfishness, yet Paul is characteristically patient, loving and committed to delivering the truth no matter how it is received.</p>",

The prophecies found in the book of Daniel are the key to unlocking all biblical prophecy. The prophet Daniel explained the past and the future of Israel and all Gentile nations according to the plan and purposes of God and his revelations do so with such incredible accuracy that he has silenced many a biblical skeptic throughout history. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Pastor Steve often cites Daniel to explain biblical prophecy elsewhere in scripture (especially in his Revelation study), and now, finally, we are pleased to present the definitive VBVMI study on this essential book of scripture.</p>",

                "description": "<p>The Book of Ruth is classically described as a love story or a story of redemption. Though these descriptions are not wrong, they are incomplete.</p>\n\n<p>The story of Ruth is a story of woman in need of grace and a man who is willing to extend it. It is also a footnote to the story of Judges and the times when Israel did what was right in its own eyes. Finally, the book of Ruth is properly understood to be a book of eschatology &ndash; a prophetic picture of God&#39;s plan for Israel and the Church. The literal events of the story foreshadow and explain God&#39;s redemption of a disobedient Israel and the opportunity for the Gentile world to share in Israel&#39;s promises.</p>\n\n<p>This course is <strong>an updated, all-new presentation</strong> of our earlier study of Ruth. Pastor Armstrong teaches both the redemption storyline and the end times story line side by side through the entire book. Join us for an entirely unique and insightful explanation of this precious book of scripture.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Our authoritative, completely-revised 34-lesson study of end times in the book of Revelation is here!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Many Christians consider Revelation to be a mysterious and even frightening book of scripture. Some avoid studying it, and among those who do try, many find it confusing. Why does the book confound so many and give rise to so many conflicting interpretations? The answer: because it&#39;s the final book&nbsp;of the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>The Bible with its 66 books can be compared to a novel having 66 chapters. Like a novel, the storyline builds from front to back, with the characters, themes and plot elements introduced early and developed across many chapters. Obviously, the Bible doesn&#39;t read like most novels, but it was intended to be understood as a single work, and it did have a single Author.</p>\n\n<p>Now consider what would happen if you selected a novel from the shelves of your local bookstore and decided to read only the final chapter. How much of that final chapter would you understand?&nbsp; Most likely, you would be thoroughly confused. Naturally, only after reading the entire book would the final chapter make any sense.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, we could see Revelation as the final chapter in God&#39;s 66-chapter novel called the Bible. In the same way we must read a novel cover to cover before understanding it properly, so must Bible students have an understanding of the Bible&#39;s first 65 books before they can truly understand the final book of Revelation.</p>\n\n<p>Under these circumstances, a verse-by-verse teaching of Revelation would be a challenging endeavor. How do you teach the last chapter in a novel when you can&#39;t be sure your audience has studied the first 65 books? The answer is simple: you teach them the entire Bible!</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, our Revelation study examines not only the 22 chapters of John&#39;s vision, it also covers relevant sections of Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Leviticus, Ruth, Kings and Chronicles, Job, the Psalms, Daniel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, all the minor prophets, the Gospels and the Epistles. Virtually every book of the Bible is consulted during our 34-hour course, leading many VBVM students to say that our Revelation study is an attempt to teach the entire Bible in a single class. We know no other way to do it!</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, there is&nbsp;no better study of end times than the VBVM International study of Revelation.</p>\n\n<p>Our book of Revelation Bible study comes complete with MP3 audio teaching, complete PDF study notes (over 200,000 words!), and full color visual aids for projection or black and white visual aids for printing. Use all the materials to study for yourself or to teach the class to others.</p>\n\n<p>Also, you can experience this same content complete with the visual aids as <a href=\"/videos/revelation-study\"><strong>videos</strong></a>. More videos will be added each week until the entire study is available (expected to be complete by the end of 2015).</p>",

Not only do we learn about our Lord&#39;s life on earth, but we also discover new spiritual importance in familiar Old Testament stories.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Pastor Armstrong teaches verse-by-verse through&nbsp;John&#39;s Gospel in his notable in-depth, insightful style.

                "description": "<p>Most of us have experienced discipline from our earthly father, but what about the discipline of our Heavenly Father? Scripture tells us that God also disciplines those He loves, yet few Christians take time to study and understand how God applies discipline in our lives. This study offers an in-depth appreciation of how the Father disciplines and then restores His children.</p>\n\n<p>The study examines events in the history of the nation of Israel, when it received the Father&#39;s discipline as they entered into Babylonian captivity and eventually were restored to the land. The study examines passages from 1 &amp; 2 Kings, 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>",
