Though few Christians study the book end to end, most recognize the book&#39;s iconic characters, including Samson, Gideon, and Deborah. Judges bridges the 300-year period between Moses and Joshua and the kings of Israel, when every tribe of Israel acted as&nbsp;nation unto itself. This is a book filled with heros, villains,&nbsp;love, war, miracles and God&#39;s grace. No wonder the book of Judges is a favorite source for&nbsp;classic Sunday school stories.\r\n\r\nThe study is conducted from the pulpit as part of the Oak Hill Bible Church Sunday services, held at 10:30 A.M. every Sunday morning. The church is located in the Oak Hill area of southwest Austin, Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp;No advance registration is required, and free childcare is available.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact VBVMI.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

So the Lord directed the prophet Samuel to appoint a king, Saul,&nbsp;who ruled&nbsp;according to his flesh even as the Lord prepared another man, David, after His own heart.\r\n\r\nLearn how Israel moved to become&nbsp;a nation under a king and how the Lord used Israel&#39;s impatience&nbsp;to demonstrate the inadequacy of human rulers in solving the problem of the nation&#39;s sin and apostasy. In addition to telling this story of Saul and David, the book of&nbsp;1Samuel introduces other&nbsp;well-known biblical characters in scripture including&nbsp;Jonathan, Mephibosheth&nbsp;and others.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPastor Armstrong teaches this year-long study through 1 Samuel&nbsp;in his notable in-depth, insightful style. Join us for this popular Old Testament book study.\r\n\r\nThe class meets weekly on Wednesday evenings from 7:00-8:30 PM, in Building 300 of Wayside Chapel.&nbsp;Students of all ages are welcome. Childcare is not available.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact the ministry. Seating in limited. Previously recorded&nbsp;lessons can be found on the 1Samuel Bible Study page.",
